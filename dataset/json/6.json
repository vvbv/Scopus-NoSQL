    "Abstract": "Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer. Caspases; the key executors of apoptotic cascade are attractive targets for selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Within this approach, various caspase activators were introduced as lead anticancer agents. In the current study, a new series of multifunctional Passerini products was synthesized and evaluated as potent caspase-dependent apoptotic inducers. The synthetic strategy adopted this isocyanide-based multicomponent reaction to possibly mimic the pharmacophoric features of various lead apoptotic inducers, where a series of α-acyloxy carboxamides was prepared from p-nitrophenyl isonitrile, cyclohexanone and various carboxylic acids. Accordingly, the main amide-based scaffold was decorated by substituents with varying nature and size to gain more information about structure-activity relationship. All the synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxicity against normal human fibroblasts and their potential anticancer activities against three human cancer cell lines; MCF-7 (breast), NFS-60 (myeloid leukemia), and HepG-2 (liver) utilizing MTT assay. Among the most active compounds, 13, 21 and 22 were more potent and safer than doxorubicin with nanomolar IC 50 values and promising selectivity indices. Mechanistically, 13, 21 and 22 induced apoptosis by significant caspase activation in all the screened cancer cell lines utilizing flow cytometric analysis and caspase 3/7 activation assay. Again, 13 and 21 recorded higher activation percentages than doxorubicin, while 22 showed comparable results. Apoptosis-inducing factor1 (AIF1) quantification assay declared that 13, 21 and 22 didn't mediate apoptosis through AIF1-dependent pathway (i.e. only by caspase activation). Physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic profiles, ligand efficiency metrics and drug-likeness data of all the synthesized compounds were computationally predicted and showed that 13, 21 and 22 could be considered as drug-like candidates. Finally, selected compounds were preliminarily screened for possible antimicrobial activities searching for dual anticancer/antimicrobial agents as an advantageous approach for cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Halogenated bisphenol A analogues (X-BPA) have been widely used in industrial production, such as flame retardant. Although BPA exposure was found to result in cytotoxicity, toxicity of X-BPA and molecular mechanism remain under-explored. In this study, we employed human breast cancer cell as a model to investigate the concentration-dependent toxicity and underlying mechanisms of tetrabromo bisphenol A (TBBPA) and tetrachloro bisphenol A (TCBPA). An integrated method involving molecular toxicology and mass spectrometry (MS)-based global metabolomics was applied to evaluate the toxicity of TCBPA and TBBPA on cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and metabolic alterations. The results demonstrated that low micromolar levels (0–10 μM) of TCBPA/TBBPA exposure induced cell proliferation and activated the energy metabolism of both glycolysis and amino acid. On the other hand, high micromolar levels (10–50 μM) of TCBPA/TBBPA exposure perturbed the balance between ROS and antioxidative defense process by promoting the ROS generation via the down-regulation of glutathione biosynthesis and up-regulation of nucleotide metabolism. This study, for the first time, provides evidence and mechanism for better understanding the cytotoxicity of TCBPA and TBBPA by regulating the specific metabolic pathways. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The idea of the use of anticancer drugs together with a chemosensitizer emerged as the strategy of reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells expressing ABC proteins many years ago. The approaches relying on the use of a single chemosensitizer have never resulted in a clinical success. Therefore, the application of drug combinations of two or more compounds with different mechanisms of action might be an alternative approach to increase the success rate. In the present study the cytotoxic and NF-κB inhibition potential of the phenothiazine derivative, MAE-TPR, was evaluated. MAE-TPR was demonstrated to be an effective doxorubicin-resistance modulator in human adenocarcinoma cell line LoVo/Dx. In the presence of MAE-TPR cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was elevated, and its intracellular accumulation increased. Strong synergism occurred between MAE-TPR and Dox. MAE-TPR diminished also the expression of ABCB1 transporter (P-glycoprotein) by affecting NF-κB pathway. Theobromine, a phytochemical from cocoa, which was barely active itself, strongly augmented MDR reversal potency of MAE-TPR. The effect of the combination of phenothiazine derivative with theobromine on cancer cells was studied for the first time in the present work. It was concluded that the use of the proposed combination of two modulators might be a promising strategy for MDR reversal since modulators could be used in concentrations much lower than in case of their single application and in that way the risk of intolerable side-effects could be reduced. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a health risk assessment of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in drinking water and food was conducted using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in major cities of China. Considering the numerous non-detected values found in drinking water samples, a zero-inflated model was employed to obtain a more precise NDMA concentration distribution function in drinking water. With exogenous chronic daily intake of 1.20 × 10 −6 mg/(kg*d), the lifetime cancer risk and disability-adjusted life years of NDMA are 4.01 × 10 −5 and 5.52 × 10 −6 per person-year (ppy). The disease burden attributable to water sources accounts for nearly 9.94% of total exogenous intake. The contribution rate of vegetables is the largest, followed by cereals, milk products, fish and shrimp, and meat. Taking endogenous sources into consideration, the contribution rates of drinking water and food sources decrease to 0.08% and 0.69%. This study provides a scientific basis for making policy decisions on NDMA pollution management. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) as two prevalent age-related disorders in male have some shared genetic and immunological underlying mechanisms. However, researchers have aimed at identification of specific biomarkers with the ability to differentiate between these disorders. In the present study, we genotyped the rs4073, rs2227306 and rs1126647 single nucleotide polymorphisms within IL-8 gene in 530 individuals including 130 PCa patients, 200 BPH patients and 200 male controls. The rs2227306 alleles and genotypes were distributed equally in the three study groups. The frequency of the A allele of the rs4073 was significantly lower in PCa group compared with BPH group (OR (95% CI) = 0.62 (0.46–0.84), adjusted P value = 0.006). This allele was negatively associated with PCa risk in dominant model (OR (95% CI) = 0.53 (0.34–0.83), adjusted P value = 0.02). When comparing PCa and BPH groups, the rs1126647 was associated with PCa risk in recessive model (OR (95% CI) = 2.14 (1.23–3.72), adjusted P value = 0.02). The A T A haplotype (rs4073, rs2227306 and rs1126647 respectively) was less frequent in PCa group compared with BPH group (OR (95% CI) = 0.4 (0.22–0.75), adjusted P value = 0.03). Consequently, our data demonstrated significant differences in allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of IL-8 variants between BPH and PCa patients which might imply distinct role for this chemokine in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Future studies are needed to elaborate the underlying mechanism of these observations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Adult-attained height is a marker for underlying mechanisms, such as cell growth, that may also influence postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) risk, perhaps specifically hormone-sensitive BC subtypes. Early life energy restriction may inhibit these mechanisms, resulting in shorter height and a reduced postmenopausal BC risk. Women (62,573) from the Netherlands Cohort Study completed a self-administered questionnaire in 1986 when 55–69 years old, and were followed-up for 20.3 years (case–cohort: N subcohort = 2,438; N cases = 3,354). Cox multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for BC risk overall and by estrogen and progesterone receptor subtypes in relation to height and early life energy restriction during the Hunger Winter, War Years, and Economic Depression. Although energy restriction can only influence longitudinal growth in women exposed before and/or during the growth spurt, it may also influence BC risk when occurring after the growth spurt, possibly through different growth processes. Therefore, Cox analyses were additionally conducted according to timing of energy restriction in relation to the growth spurt. Height was associated with an increased BC risk (HR per 5cm = 1.07, 95%CI:1.01–1.13), particularly hormone receptor-positive BC. Energy restriction before and/or during the growth spurt was associated with a decreased hormone receptor-positive BC risk. Energy restriction during the Hunger Winter increased the estrogen receptor-negative BC risk regardless of the timing of energy restriction. In conclusion, height and energy restriction before and/or during the growth spurt were both associated with hormone receptor-positive BC risk, in the direction as expected, indicating critical exposure windows for hormonal growth-related mechanisms. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Ceria nanoparticles (NPs) are promising materials for their superior anticancer and antifungal activities. In this work, we synthesized Fe-doped ceria NPs by co-precipitation method using xanthan gum (XG) as a green capping agent. The NPs were calcined at different temperatures ranging from 200 to 800 °C. The crystallinity, crystallite size, structure, particle size, morphology, and magnetic property of the NPs were investigated by using x-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetization, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The influence of calcination temperature on the crystallite size was critically examined. The crystallize size of the Fe-doped ceria NPs was dependent on the calcination process and increased with increasing temperature. Nanocrystalline ceria particles with spherical morphology was chosen for cytotoxic studies. Anticancer activities were investigated against Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 breast cancer cell lines through 3–4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)− 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay while antifungal activities against clinical isolates of C. albicans. Fe-doped ceria NPs reduced the cell viability to about 21% of the control after 72 h of exposure. The NPs have the necessary promises for use as an effective agent toward therapy of cancer cells. The antifungal study indicated that Fe-doped ceria NPs are effective anti-fungal agent and exhibit superior activity compared to an antibiotic, fluconazole. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper several advances were implemented for glycoprofiling of prostate specific antigen (PSA), what can be applied for better prostate cancer (PCa) diagnostics in the future: 1) application of Au nanoshells with a magnetic core (MP@silica@Au); 2) use of surface plasmons of Au nanoshells with a magnetic core for spontaneous immobilization of zwitterionic molecules via diazonium salt grafting; 3) a double anti-fouling strategy with integration of zwitterionic molecules on Au surface and on MP@silica@Au particles was implemented to resist non-specific protein binding; 4) application of anti-PSA antibody modified Au nanoshells with a magnetic core for enrichment of PSA from a complex matrix of a human serum; 5) direct incubation of anti-PSA modified MP@silica@Au with affinity bound PSA to the lectin modified electrode surface. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) signal was enhanced 43 times integrating Au nanoshells with a magnetic core compared to the biosensor without them. This proof-of-concept study shows that the biosensor could detect PSA down to 1.2 fM and at the same time to glycoprofile such low PSA concentration using a lectin patterned biosensor device. The biosensor offers a recovery index of 108%, when serum sample was spiked with a physiological concentration of PSA (3.5 ng mL −1 ). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent cancer among children, and multidrug efflux mediated by overexpression of ABC transporters is the major impediment to successful chemotherapy in this malignancy. The goal of this study is to identify the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which may affect the expression levels of ABCA3; the previously identified prognostic biomarker for multidrug resistance (MDR) in childhood ALL (cALL). Bone marrow samples from 64 cALLs, including 46 de novo and 18 relapsed patients, in addition to 30 non-cancer controls were collected, and ncRNAs were nominated using in silico studies. Quantitative RT-PCR showed low expression profiles of miR-335-3p in cALLs compared with the control group (P = 0.018). Inverse correlation was determined between the miR-335-3p and ABCA3 mRNA expression profiles in cALL patients (r = 0.5019, P = 0.002). Moreover, it was shown that the expression levels of miR-335-3p was downregulated in the drug-resistant samples (MDR group) compared with the drug-sensitive patients (mrd− group), (P = 0.0005, AUC = 0.801). On the other hand, negative correlations were identified between the expression levels of miR-335-3p and the selected LncRNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1, in the MDR group compared with the mrd− patients (P = 0.009), suggesting a sponge effect for these LncRNAs. The current study showed a potential regulatory role for miR-335-3p in ABCA3 expression targeted by NEAT1 and MALAT1 long non-coding RNAs. This negative impact may possibly contribute to the development of chemoresistance in childhood ALL, and provide an exceptional insight to new therapeutic approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) as appealing targets for the treatment of many diseases has been studied extensively and its use in cancer care is the most important. Here, we developed a series of novel derivatives containing isoindolinone skeleton. Twelve compounds demonstrated nanomolar IC 50 values against HDAC1, and the best compounds were 5a (65.6 nM), 5b (65.1 nM) and 13a (57.9 nM). In vitro, 5a and 5b also showed potent antiproliferative activities against several cancer cell lines, in particular 5b, which behaved better than approved drug chidamide. Morever, enzyme inhibition and western blot assay established 5b to be a selective inhibitor for HDAC1-3. Molecular docking was performed to rationalize the high potency of isoindolinones. Additionally, 5b had more appropriate drug metabolism in human liver microsome (HLM) compared with chidamide and moderate pharmacokinetics properties. These results indicated that 5b was worthy of further biological studies. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) have been reported to play pivotal roles in various cancers. Recently, MIR31HG was proposed to be involved in tumor progression. However, its role in non small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) remains elusive. In this work, we found that SP1-induced MIR31HG was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, Cox multivariate survival analysis revealed that high MIR31HG was an independent predictor of poor overall survival(OS). Functionally, knockdown of TINCR obviously suppressed NSCLC cells migration and invasion in vitro and inhibited NSCLC cells metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified MIR31HG could act as a miR-214 sponge using RNA pull down, luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Lastly, we verified that overexpression of MIR31HG effectively reverses miR-214-induced inhibition of NSCLC cells progression.

    "Abstract": "Photo-switchable dual-color fluorescent nanogels were fabricated via nanoprecipitation in aqueous solution. The spiropyran-modified β-cyclodextrin (β-CD-SP) and 4-amino-7-nitro-1,2,3-benzoxadiazole (NBDNH 2 ) were encapsulated into nanogels in the presence of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI). In the nanogels, spiropyran moiety acted as fluorescence molecule acceptors under the irradiation of UV or visible light to quench or recover the fluorescence of the NBDNH 2 to achieve reversible dual-color fluorescence. The feed ratio of the two fluorophores played vital role on the energy transfer efficiency (E) of the nanogels, and the results showed that high E (90.7%) can be achieved when the feed ratio of NBDNH 2 /β-CD-SP is 1:2 (mol/mol). In addition, the nanogels can maintain good photo-switchable fluorescent behavior as long as 5 weeks. With rapid photo-responsiveness (within 60 s), good reversibility, long-term stability, and excellent cytocompatibility, the as-prepared nanogels have been successfully applied to photo-switchable dual-color fluorescent imaging in cancer cell. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Compounds 7h, 9a and 9l showed potent inhibitory activity against VEGFR-2 kinase with IC 50 values of 87, 27 and 94 nM, respectively in comparison to sorafenib (IC 50 = 180 nM) as a reference. Compounds 7h, 9a and 9l were further screened for their antitumor activity against specific resistant human cancer cell lines from different origins (Panc-1, OVCAR-3, HT29 and 786-O cell lines) where compound 7h showed significant cell death in most of them. Multi-kinase inhibition assays were performed for the most potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors where compound 7h showed enhanced potency towards EGFR, HER-2, c-MET and MER kinases. Cell cycle analysis of A549 cells treated with 9a showed cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and pro-apoptotic activity as indicated by annexin V-FITC staining. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Polymeric micelles have been widely studied and developed for targeted delivery of cytostatic drugs. However, due to heterogeneity of tumor cells, targeting efficiency may be enhanced by using different types of targeting agents on the same drug delivery system. The aim of the study was to obtain and characterize paclitaxel-loaded biodegradable poly(L-lactide)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-PEG) micelles functionalized with folic acid and biotin. The developed dual targeted micelles show low critical micelle concentration, high loading capacity of paclitaxel and prolonged in vitro drug release. The cytotoxicity of paclitaxel-loaded micelles was confirmed against folate- and biotin-receptor positive OVCAR3 cells, which indicates their usefulness for targeted delivery of cytostatic drug. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Rifampicin, an important member of ansamycin family, exhibits various biological activities. It is frequently used for the treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy. Recently, its interaction with protein is evidenced. But, its interaction with DNA is still unknown. Whether, exhibition of anti-cancer activity of rifampicin is associated with DNA-cleavage activity is also unknown. In this study, an attempt has been taken to understand these two unknown aspects. Spectroscopic studies indicated that rifampicin binds to CT-DNA with a binding constant of ~5.22 × 10 5 M −1 . Several independent experiments like CD analysis, competitive displacement experiments and viscosity measurements revealed that rifampicin intercalates into the CT-DNA. Molecular docking studies corroborate this fact and depicted that this drug binds to the GC-rich region of DNA through multiple hydrogen bonding having the relative binding energy of −9.21 kcal mol −1 . Besides, DNA binding ability, rifampicin causes the photo-cleavage of pUC19 DNA via singlet oxygen pathway. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time the DNA binding and DNA cleavage ability of rifampicin. This study provides a clue behind the execution of the anti-cancer activity of rifampicin. Overall, all these information can be used for further understanding the pharmacological effects of rifampicin. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This report describes a full-scale experiment on intradermal Ehrlich carcinoma (EC) differentiation in mouse model using NIR spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance mode and chemometric data processing. EC is widely used as an experimental tumor model due to its resemblance with human undifferentiated epithelial tumors and can be applied as a preclinical testing in order to verify the capability of NIR spectroscopy to distinguish cancer from healthy tissues before a clinical research with an aim of creating a new analytical tool for on-line intraoperative tumor margins assessment. The study consists of five steps of NIR spectra measurements: in vivo on the early stage of carcinoma growth; in vivo on the advanced stage of carcinoma growth; in vivo during the surgery; in vitro study of the post-operative materials stored in formalin; in vitro study of the post-operative materials stored in paraffin. It was shown that reliable tumor differentiation with a compact optic fiber probe was possible in all these cases. The classification models were built on two data sets, obtained during in vivo and in vitro measurements; both of them demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been applied as biomarkers and better detection of their expression profiles plays important roles in early diagnosis of cancers. In this work, a simple dual-signal amplification strategy has been used to construct a novel nanosensor on single Au nanowire electrodes (SAuNWEs) for miRNA-16 detection based on the “signal-on” and “signal-off” features during hybridization/de-hybridization process. The ferrocene-labeled aptamer capture probe (Fc-CP-16) is designed to hybridize with thiolated methylene blue-labeled DNA probe (MB-CP) on SAuNWE to form duplex DNA, and the addition of miRNA-16 can lead to the dissociation of duplex structure due to the highly matched sequences between miRNA-16 and Fc-CP-16. The remaining MB-CP can thus tend to recover its hairpin structure at the presence of Mg 2+ through the hybridization of its complementary sequences. During this hybridization/de-hybridization process, the changes of Fc and MB oxidation peaks can be recorded, and there has a linear relationship between the sum of dual-signal changes (ΔI=ΔI MB +|ΔI Fc |) and the logarithm of miRNA-16 concentrations, which can be used to detect miRNA-16. Including miRNA extraction, the dual-signal amplification strategy for miRNA sensing assay was carried out about 2 h for the detection in real samples. This novel nanosensor has small dimension, good selectivity, rapid response and regeneration ability, which can satisfy the need for early cancer marker detection in cells/organelles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A carboxymethyl polysaccharide CMP33 (15.23 × 10 4 Da) was isolated from edible and pharmaceutical mushroom Poria cocos using alkaline extraction followed by DEAE-52 and Saphadex-G200 + Saphadex-G150 column chromatographies. The structure analysis showed that CMP33 was composed of glucosyl residues containing a backbone chain of (1 → 3)-linked glucose residues and side chains of (1 → 6) and (1 → 2)-linked glucose residues, and possessed triple-helix structure. Bioassay results revealed that CMP33 displayed a dose-dependent inhibition on 5 cancer cells (HepG-2, MCF-7, SGC-7901, A549) in the range of 31.25–1000 μg/mL, but low cytotoxicity on normal liver cells L-O2. Moreover, CMP33 stimulated NO release and cytokine secretion (IL-1β IL-6 and TNF-α), and also inhibited LPS-stimulated overproduction of NO, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β in RAW264.7 cells. These results suggested that CMP33 possessed anticancer, anti-inflammation and immune-stimulation activities, and potential for developing as a bioactive ingredient in functional foods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Food waste is a low-cost and nutritious source of feed which could be beneficial to the fishery industry. The objective of this study was to use fermented food wastes as major sources of protein to replace the fish meal used in fish feeds for culturing jade perch (Scortum barcoo) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Two experiments (a laboratory and a field trial) were conducted to test the suitability of the fish feeds for the two fish species. In the laboratory trial, six out of seven formulations (six food waste-based formulations and one commercial diet as control) were tested on jade perch whereas four out of the seven formulations were tested on Nile tilapia to study the effects of the diets on the growth performance and serum immunological parameters of fish. The formulations (Diet F and Diet A) with the best growth performance (feed conversion ratio (FCR) of jade perch (1.98) and Nile tilapia (1.28)) while having the lowest amount of fish meal (5%) were selected for field scale feeding trial. In addition, the percentage of fermented food waste ingredient in fish feed (Diet A and Diet F) was about 50% without causing significant effects on the immunity (P &lt; 0.05) of the two fish species when compared with control diet. In the field scale feeding trial, FCR values of jade perch and Nile tilapia fed with Diet F and A were 1.06 and 1.16, respectively, which were similar to the control diet (P &gt; 0.05). Metal/loids concentrations in fish tissue showed that both fish species fed with food waste-based pellets (Nile tilapia) Diet A: As (0.028 mg/kg), Cd (0.011 mg/kg), Cr (0.163 mg/kg), Cu (0.851 mg/kg), Hg (0.141 mg/kg), Pb (0.081 mg/kg) and Zn (30.8 mg/kg)) and jade perch Diet F: As (0.709 mg/kg), Cd (0.026 mg/kg), Cr (0.300 mg/kg), Cu (2.49 mg/kg), Hg (0.318 mg/kg), Pb (1.745 mg/kg) and Zn (40.9 mg/kg) were all below the maximum permissible levels of the local standard (As (AS 2 O 3 ) = 6 mg/kg; Cd = 2 mg/kg; Cr = 1 mg/kg; Pb = 6 mg/kg; Hg = 0.5 mg/kg), while no permissible levels of Cu and Pb are stipulated by the standard. The results of the human health risk assessment indicated that the fish cultured with food waste-based diets were generally safe for human consumption (Hazard Index values: 0.075–0.054; cancer risk range: 2.14–8.15 × 10 −6 ). The present study revealed that fermented food waste could serve as protein substitute in fish feed for the culture of quality jade perch and Nile tilapia for human consumption. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "It is important to assess indoor air quality in school classrooms where the air quality may significantly influence school children's health and performance. This study aims to determine the concentrations of PM2.5 and dust chemical compositions in indoor and outdoor school classroom located in Kuala Lumpur City Centre. The PM2.5 concentration was measured from 19th September 2017–16th February 2018 using an optical PM2.5 sensor. Indoor and outdoor dust was also collected from the school classrooms and ion and trace metal concentrations were analysed using ion chromatography (IC) and inductively couple plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) respectively. This study showed that the average indoor and outdoor 24 h PM2.5 was 11.2 ± 0.45 µg m−3 and 11.4 ± 0.44 µg m−3 respectively. The 8 h PM2.5 concentration ranged between 3.2 and 28 µg m−3 for indoor and 3.2 and 19 µg m−3 for outdoor classrooms. The highest ion concentration in indoor dust was Ca2+ with an average concentration of 38.5 ± 35.0 µg g−1 while for outdoor dust SO4 2- recorded the highest ion concentration with an average concentration of 30.6 ± 9.37 µg g−1. Dominant trace metals in both indoor and outdoor dust were Al, Fe and Zn. Principle component analysis-multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) demonstrated that the major source of indoor dust was road dust (69%), while soil dominated the outdoor dust (74%). Health risk assessment showed that the hazard quotient (HQ) value for non-carcinogenic trace metals was &lt; 1 while the total cancer risk (CR) value for carcinogenic elements was below the acceptable limit for both indoor and outdoor dust through dermal and inhalation pathways, but not the ingestion pathway. This study suggests indoor contributions of PM2.5 concentrations are due to the activities of the school children while the compositions of indoor and outdoor dust are greatly influenced by the soil/earth source plus industrial and traffic contribution. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "New mixed Fe(III) and Zn(II) complexes with isonitrosoacetophenone (HINAP) and L-amino acids (such as L-histidine, L-phenylalanine and L-proline) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, UV–Vis, IR and ESR spectroscopy and thermal analyses. The values of molar conductance of the complexes in DMSO solution at 10 −3 M concentration indicate their non-electrolyte nature. IR spectroscopy has revealed the coordination of deprotonated ligands to metal through nitrogen and oxygen atoms in an N 2 O 2 arrangement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the hybrid functional of Truhlar and Zhao (M06) with basis set of double zeta quality LANL2DZ to evaluate the cis and trans coordination modes and to ascertain dipole moment, HOMO-LUMO energy gap, chemical hardness, softness and electrophilicity. The magnetic moments and ESR measurements suggest that there is an admixture of S = 5/2 and S = 1/2 spins in Fe(III) complexes. UV–Visible spectra indicate a distorted octahedral geometry around the metal ions. Thermal analyses show the presence of hydrated and coordinated water. The antimicrobial activity was investigated against (G + and G − ) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (Candida albicans). The iron and zinc complexes were found to be more active against Gram-positive than Gram negative bacteria. They also show considerable growth inhibition against the fungi tested. In vitro antitumor activity assayed against cancer cell lines of the HEP2 type (cancer cells of the larynx) exhibited significant toxicity of the ligands and their mixed complexes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Here, antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of whole extract of the rhizome of Zingiber officinalis (ZOWE), was investigated in K562 cell line derived from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient. Various concentrations of whole extract (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μM) were tested in K562 cultures. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis was assessed with appropriate methods, as well as cellular ROS levels. In this study, we showed that ZOWE inhibited proliferation of K562 cells substantially, when compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy donor. Increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased PARP cleavage demonstrated that ZOWE inhibited proliferation by induction of apoptosis. These changes were coupled with an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, ZOWE addition to the culture also reduced expression levels of survival proteins pAkt and survivin, in a concentration dependent manner. Our results clearly mark that ZOWE causes to a reduction in cell viability, an induction of apoptosis and elevation in ROS levels in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and effects are significantly different from healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells, further supporting its potential therapeutic value. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Bright red-emitting pyridinium cyanine based styryl probe 2 is synthesized in good yields. Probe 2 demonstrated a large Stokes’ shift (Δλ ≈ 128 nm, 4227 cm −1 in DCM) and excellent fluorescent quantum yield (Φ f1 ≈ 0.2 - 0.7) due to strong Intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT). Probe 2 was found to exhibit exceptional selectivity for cellular mitochondria in both normal (COS-7) and cancer (A549) cell lines. Probe 2 is readily applicable as a “wash-free” dye to visualize mitochondria as it does not require post-staining washing prior to imaging. Styryl probe 2 also showed an excellent biocompatibility as the calculated LC 50 (lethal concentration, 50%) value was &gt; 20 μM. Probe 2 emission did not show any interferences from anionic species or other biological molecules. Probe 2 is readily excitable (λ ex ∼460 and λ em ∼618 nm) with the available laser (454 nm) in commercial microscopes and thus it can be a useful probe for mitochondrial tracking in live cells. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "B-group vitamins, as components of the one carbon metabolism pathway, are involved in DNA synthesis, repair and methylation. Our aim was to investigate associations between circulating plasma levels of B vitamins and urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC). We conducted a nested case–control study of UCC within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. B vitamins were measured in pre-diagnostic plasma samples. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for UCC risk associated with circulating B vitamins in 363 matched cases and controls. In a case-only analysis (N = 390), hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival associated with plasma B vitamins were estimated using Cox regression. There were no strong associations between UCC risk and pre-diagnostic levels of plasma B vitamins. No heterogeneity in UCC risk was observed by subtype (invasive or superficial), sex, smoking status or alcohol intake. There was no heterogeneity by country of birth for most B vitamins, except for folate (p-homogeneity = 0.03). In UCC cases, there were no strong associations between plasma B vitamins and overall survival. We found no associations between pre-diagnostic plasma concentrations of B-group vitamins and UCC risk or survival. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "A new and straightforward optical sensor for the colorimetric determination of adenosine (AD) in human urine samples was developed. The sensor comprised silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as colorimetric elements and anti-AD aptamer (AP) as a recognition probe. In a solution containing AD and high concentration of NaCl, due to the unique binding of AD with AP, the aggregated metal nanomaterials dispersed in the solution, and the color intensity of the solution was changed accordingly. The absorbance of the solution was monitored for AD quantification. The method was applicable for the determination of AD in the concentration range of 60–280 nM with the detection limit of 21 nM. The relative standard deviation ranged from 4.8 to 8.8% for six replicates. The method showed excellent selectivity toward AD checked over some probable interfering compounds. To investigate the performance of AgNPs, the analytical characteristics of the method including linear range, detection limit, selectivity, and precision were compared with those obtained by a common AuNPs-based aptasensor. The reliability of the method was further ascertained for the detection of AD in urine samples of two lung cancer patients with percentage recoveries in the range of 98–107%. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "PIM kinase family (PIM-1, PIM-2 and PIM-3) is an appealing target for the discovery and development of selective inhibitors, useful in various disease conditions in which these proteins are highly expressed, such as cancer. The significant effort put, in the recent years, towards the development of small molecules exhibiting inhibitory activity against this protein family has ended up with several molecules entering clinical trials. As part of our ongoing exploration for potential drug candidates that exhibit affinity towards this protein family, we have generated a novel chemical series of triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine based tricycles by applying a scaffold hopping strategy over our previously reported potent pan-PIM inhibitor ETP-47453 (compound 2). The structure-activity relationship studies presented herein demonstrate a rather selective PIM-1/PIM-3 biochemical profile for this novel series of tricycles, although pan-PIM and PIM-1 inhibitors have also been identified. Selected examples show significant inhibition of the phosphorylation of BAD protein in a cell-based assay. Moreover, optimized and highly selective compounds, such as 42, did not show significant hERG inhibition at 20 μM concentration, and proved its antiproliferative activity and utility in combination with particular antitumoral agents in several tumor cell lines. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Bacteroides fragilis is an anaerobic bacterium naturally hosted in the human colon flora. B. fragilis D‑lactate dehydrogenase (BfD‑LDH) is an important enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of D‑lactate to pyruvate and regulates anaerobic glycolysis. In this study BfD‑LDH has been targeted for structure based drug design. B. fragilis D‑lactate dehydrogenase has been expressed, purified and inhibitory activities of 25 coumarin derivatives previously synthetize for their antioxidant activity were evaluated. Among the 25 coumarin derivatives, compound 6a, 5l, and 6b exhibited the highest inhibitory activity with IC 50 values of 0,47 μM, 0,57 μM ve 0,057 μM, respectively. The results indicate that the mechanism by which 6a, 5l and 6b coumarin derivatives inhibit BfD‑LDH by reversible non-competitive inhibition. Docking experiments were carried out to further explain the results and compare the theoretical and experimental affinity of these compounds to the BfD‑LDH protein. According to docking results, all coumarins bind to the site occupied by pyruvate and the nicotinamide ring of NADH. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Dual Specificity Phosphatase 12 is a member of the Atypical DUSP Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase family, meaning that it does not contain typical MAP kinase targeting motifs, while being able to dephosphorylate tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. DUSP12 contains, apart from its catalytic domain, a zinc finger domain, making it one of the largest DUSPs, which displays strong nuclear expression in several tissues. In this work we identified nuclear targets of DUSP12 in two different cancer cell lines (A549 and MCF-7), challenging them with genotoxic stimuli to observe the effect on the networks and to link existing information about DUSP12 functions to the data obtained though mass spectrometry. We found network connections to the cytoskeleton (e.g. IQGAP1), to the chromatin (e.g. HP1BP3), to the splicing machinery and to the previously known pathway of ribosome maturation (e.g. TCOF1), which draw insight into many of the functions of this phosphatase, much likely connecting it to distinct, previously unknown genomic stability mechanisms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Combination therapy involves the design of one unit with various therapeutic effects, such as simultaneous photothermal therapy (PTT), chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT), to produce high therapeutic efficacy with minimized side effects. Here, we designed a single near-infrared (NIR) light induced tri-mode (PTT, PDT and chemotherapy) combined therapeutic nanoplatform (named IONCs@Ce6-DOX/PCM) based on amine-functionalized iron oxide nanocrystals (IONCs). The IONCs, were subsequently loaded with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), doxorubicin (DOX) and a layer of tetradecanol (PCM, a temperature sensitive phase-change material used as a smart switch for drug release). In this system, the IONCs generate heat for PTT and melt the coated PCM when irradiated by a 650 nm laser with a low power density (230 mW/cm 2 ), resulting in the release of encapsulated DOX. Simultaneously, the exposed Ce6 can also generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the same NIR light irradiation, thereby achieving combined therapy triggered by a single light. Moreover, taking advantage of the magnetic property of IONCs, the nanoplatform could also be developed as a biocompatible diagnostic agent for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. This, indicates that the multifunctional carriers can facilitate a range of imaging guided cancer treatments and provide synergistic photothermal/chemo/photodynamic therapy for improved treatment efficiency and minimized side effects. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 is widely distributed in population, which is responsible for more than 50% of cervical cancers. A point-of-care testing for HPV16 is critical for early diagnosis and decisions regarding patient care. In this work, a novel lateral flow strip biosensor (LFSB) has been established by a simple, low-cost and green synthetic procedure for the detection of HPV16 DNA. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) were used as colored tags in the LFSB for the first time. In a typical experimental procedure, CuO NPs were sequentially functionalized with streptavidin and biotinylated capture DNA to form the CuO Capture probes. In the present of HPV16 DNA, the CuO Capture probes would capture the target, forming a characteristic brown band due to the second base pairing with the test DNA probes on the test zone of LFSB, which enabling the visual detection. A portable strips reader achieved the quantitative detection. The optimized CuO-based LFSB was capable of detecting the target over its concentration ranged from 5 nM to 100 nM with a limit of detection of 1.0 nM, and the whole detection process could be completed within 20 min. The CuO-based LFSB shows a great promise and versatile opportunities in point-of-care diagnosis of genetic diseases with good reproducibility and stability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a simple, one step and eco-friendly synthetic strategy is developed for the fabrication of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) using pepsin as a reducing and capping agent. The pepsin-Au NCs (P-Au NCs) displayed the excitation and emission peaks at 416 and 655 nm, and exhibiting red luminescence under UV lamp at 365 nm. The fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of P-Au NCs is 7.4%. The P-Au NCs act as specific biosensor for the detection of spermine in the presence of other structural similar compounds via fluorescence turn-off mechanism. The sensing principle is based on the spermine-induced fluorescence quenching of P-Au NCs, which leads to increase the size of Au NCs. The degree of florescence quenching was linear with spermine concentration (0.0075–10 μM), with a detection limit of 1.75 nM, which is much lower for the quantification of spermine in urine samples of cancer patients. Compared to other reported methods, the P-Au NCs-based analytical strategy provides a simple synthetic route for fluorescent Au NCs with good QY and showed high selectivity for the detection of spermine with improved accuracy and precision. This method demonstrates as a facile and cost-effective analytical strategy for sensitive and selective fluorescence turn-off assay of spermine in urine samples. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is essential in cervical carcinogenesis, however, less is known about the carcinogenic potential of individual HPV types. Our aim was to examine the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) after persistence of 13 individual oncogenic HPV types. Liquid-based cervical samples (n = 40,399) collected in 2002–2005 were tested for HPV by hybrid capture 2 and genotyped with INNO-LiPAv2. Persistence was defined as having the same genotype twice 1–4.5 years apart. The absolute risk of CIN3+ was estimated by the Aalen-Johansen estimator and Cox proportional hazard regression was used to compare the rates of CIN3+ according to HPV type adjusting for age and time between HPV tests. Of 2,875 oncogenic HPV-positive women, 874 had persistence of one or more types and 761 persisted for one oncogenic HPV type only. Persistent HPV16 infection was associated with the highest risk of CIN3+, with an 8-year absolute risk of 55% (95% CI: 45%–66%), followed by HPV33 (33% (95% CI: 20%–50%)), HPV18 (32% (95% CI: 20%–48%)) and HPV31 (31% (95% CI: 21%–46%)). Other HPV types, including HPV52 and HPV45, were also associated with high risks. Persistent HPV56 had the lowest 8-year absolute risk of CIN3+ (3% (95% CI: 0.4%–20%)). In Cox analyses, a similar pattern remained after adjustment for age and time between tests. Our results add knowledge about the varying carcinogenic potential of individual persistent oncogenic HPV types, which may have implications for the clinical use of HPV testing. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Ferric ions play significant roles in human bodily functions, since both overload and deficiency can cause major physiological dysfunctions. Hence, engineering of sensitive, selective sensors to detect such ions merits attention. We found that certain CDs derived from a nitrogen-containing precursor (phthalocyanine) in suitable media could provide significant advantages. Excitation-independent carbon dots (CDs) were prepared through facile one-pot hydrothermal (W-CDs) and solvothermal (E-CDs) methods. Compared to W-CDs, ethanol-mediated E-CDs provide narrower particle size distribution, higher pyrrolic and pyridinic N-content, higher quantum yield (QY E-CDs /QY W-CDs = 2.58), strong green luminescence, excellent biocompatibility and efficient two-photon absorption. The E-CDs enabled superior NIR excitable two-photon bioimaging of breast cancer cells at variable depths and fluorescence quenching (81% extinction) for 10–600 μM Fe 3+ ions. The mechanism of sensing was elucidated based on the fluorescence lifetime and the Stern-Volmer formalism. Intracellular Fe 3+ ion sensing was first confirmed with E-CDs for lysed MCF-7 cells and quenching was detected in direct proportion to Fe 3+ concentration (0–80 μM test range) with an LOD of 10.8 nM. Next, MCF-7 cells supplemented with variable concentrations of Fe 3+ were incubated with E-CDs for sensing intracellular Fe 3+ in live cells. The E-CDs showed high sensitivity for sensing endogenous Fe 3+ ions in a stress-induced cell-based model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Diesel particulate matter (DPM) is a dominant contaminant in fine particulate matters (PM 2.5 ) and has been proved to induce serious harmful effects to human beings, including lung cancer, allergic, and chronic bronchitis. However, little attention has been paid to understand the transgenerational effects of DPM. In the present study, we focused on the transgenerational effects of DPM in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) exposed in either maternal generation (F0) or consecutive generations (F0-F5). In maternal exposure manner, 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL DPM significantly increased the germ cell apoptosis at F0 generation, while the number of apoptotic germ cells at F1-F5 generation were gradually recovered back to control level. The brood size were significantly reduced by DPM at F2 generation and recovered to control level at F3-F5 generations. In continuous exposure manner, although 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL DPM induced significant germ cell apoptosis in F0 generation, there was no difference between F0 and other generations. Continuous exposure to DPM at 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL impaired the brood size in F2 to F5 generations. Using a series of loss-of-function mutant strains, we found that cep-1 (w40), hus-1 (op241), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) related signaling pathway genes were involved in DPM-induced apoptosis. Our results clearly demonstrated that the adverse effects of DPM could be passed on through long-term multigenerational exposure and DNA damage checkpoint genes and MAPK signal pathway played an essential role in response to DPM induced development and reproduction toxicity © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The engineering of luminescent nanoplatforms for biomedical applications displaying ability for scaling-up, good colloidal stability in aqueous solutions, biocompatibility, and providing an easy detection in vivo by fluorescence methods while offering high potential of functionalities, is currently a challenge. The original strategy proposed here involves the use of large pore (ca. 15 nm) mesoporous silica (MS) nanoparticles (NPs) having a stellate morphology (denoted STMS) on which fluorescent InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) are covalently grafted with a high yield (≥90%). These nanoplatforms are after that further coated to avoid a potential QDs release. To protect the QDs from potential release or dissolution, two wrapping methods are developed: (i) a further coating with a silica shell having small pores (≤2 nm) or (ii) a tight polysaccharide shell deposited on the surface of these STMS@QDs particles via an original isobutyramide (IBAM)-mediated method. Both wrapping approaches yield to novel luminescent nanoplatforms displaying a highly controlled structure, a high size monodispersity (ca. 200 and 100 nm respectively) and colloidal stability in aqueous solutions. Among both methods, the IBAM-polysaccharide coating approach is shown the most suitable to ensure QDs protection and to avoid metal cation release over three months. Furthermore, these original STMS@QDs@polysaccharide luminescent nanoplatforms are shown biocompatible in vitro with murine cancer cells and in vivo after injections within zebrafish (ZF) translucent embryos where no sign of toxicity is observed during their development over several days. As assessed by in vivo confocal microscopy imaging, these nanoplatforms are shown to rapidly extravasate from blood circulation to settle in neighboring tissues, ensuring a remanent fluorescent labelling of ZF tissues in vivo. Such fluorescent and hybrid STMS composites are envisioned as novel luminescent nanoplatforms for in vivo fluorescence tracking applications and offer a versatile degree of additional functionalities (drug delivery, incorporation of magnetic/plasmonic core). © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "We present SIBIA (Scalable Integrated Biophysics-based Image Analysis), a framework for joint image registration and biophysical inversion and we apply it to analyze MR images of glioblastomas (primary brain tumors). We have two applications in mind. The first one is normal-to-abnormal image registration in the presence of tumor-induced topology differences. The second one is biophysical inversion based on single-time patient data. The underlying optimization problem is highly non-linear and non-convex and has not been solved before with a gradient-based approach. Given the segmentation of a normal brain MRI and the segmentation of a cancer patient MRI, we determine tumor growth parameters and a registration map so that if we “grow a tumor” (using our tumor model) in the normal brain and then register it to the patient image, then the registration mismatch is as small as possible. This “coupled problem” two-way couples the biophysical inversion and the registration problem. In the image registration step we solve a large-deformation diffeomorphic registration problem parameterized by an Eulerian velocity field. In the biophysical inversion step we estimate parameters in a reaction–diffusion tumor growth model that is formulated as a partial differential equation (PDE). In SIBIA, we couple these two sub-components in an iterative manner. We first presented the components of SIBIA in “Gholami et al., Framework for Scalable Biophysics-based Image Analysis, IEEE/ACM Proceedings of the SC2017” in which we derived parallel distributed memory algorithms and software modules for the decoupled registration and biophysical inverse problems. In this paper, our contributions are the introduction of a PDE-constrained optimization formulation of the coupled problem, and the derivation of a Picard iterative solution scheme. We perform extensive tests to experimentally assess the performance of our method on synthetic and clinical datasets. We demonstrate the convergence of the SIBIA optimization solver in different usage scenarios. We demonstrate that using SIBIA, we can accurately solve the coupled problem in three dimensions (256 3 resolution) in a few minutes using 11 dual-x86 nodes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Technical titanium (Ti) and its alloys are the most commonly used biomaterials. Therefore, it is important to know how the corrosion of a metal device implanted in the human body causes clinically significant problems and it is necessary to develop an in vivo method to examine the condition of the implant. Raman spectroscopy offers the possibility of inserting a Raman probe into the vicinity of the implant to determine the surface condition of the implant and the content of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) in the surrounding area. For this purpose, trace elements in human body fluids; e. g., peptides, can be used. For the above reasons, in this work the surfaces of Ti plate and TiO 2 (anatase and rutile) nanostructures (TiO 2 NPs) were characterized using ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies as well as scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). These metal surfaces were used as highly sensitive, uniform, and reproducible sensors of the natural ligand (bombesin, BN) of some types of metabotropic seven transmembrane G protein-coupled superfamily receptors (GPCRs), which are over-express on the surface of many malignant tumors and are present in human body fluids. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was used to monitor the geometry of adsorbate, to separate, enrich, and detect a variety of BN fragments in a physiological environment and to determine the type of surface (Ti vs TiO 2 ). Our work extends the use of SERS to monitor the implant surface and the presence of titanium oxide in the surrounding environment as well as the use of Ti/TiO 2 NPs as potential receptor-positive cancer markers or the use of peptides to inhibit the photocatalitic properties of anatase TiO 2 NPs. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Medical image analysis is motivated by deep learning emergence and computation power increase. Meanwhile, relevant deep features can significantly enhance learnable expert and intelligent systems performance and reduce diagnosis time and arduousness. This paper presents a deep learning-based radiomics framework for aided diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. MR Images with histologically confirmed Liposarcoma (LPS) and Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) have been retrieved from the Cancer Imaging Archives database and pre-processed to recuperate ROIs from MR scans with delineated tumors. This study investigates the significance and impact of medical image fusion on deep feature learning based on transfer learning from the natural domain to the medical domain. Towards this end, we propose to fuse T1 with T2FS or STIR modalities using type-2 fuzzy sets in the non-subsampled shearlet domain. Being decomposed, low-frequency sub-images were selected using local energy and type-2 fuzzy entropy, while high frequencies were selected according to the maximum of the absolute value. Experimental results indicated that the proposed fusion framework outperformed the state-of-the-art fuzzy logic-based fusion techniques in terms of entropy and mutual information. Accordingly, we fine-tuned the pre-trained AlexNet deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). First, with the pre-processed dataset, and second with the fused images. As a result, the average classification accuracy using the augmented training data by image rotation and flipping was 97.17% with the raw data and 98.28% with the fused images, which highlighted the usefulness of complementary information for deep feature learning. One crucial concern was to investigate the depth of knowledge transferability. We incrementally fine-tuned the pre-trained CNN to assess the required level that achieves performance improvements in STS classification. Through layer-wise fine-tuning, our study further confirms the potential of middle and deep layers in performance improvement. Moreover, the transferability was concluded better than random weights. With the encouragement of classification results, our aided diagnosis framework may be in the pipeline to assist radiologists in classifying LPS and LMS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "It is highly desirable to develop a new hybrid nanoplatform that integrates diagnosis and treatment elements for effective theranostics of tumors. Herein, we have skillfully designed a nanoplatform of polydopamine (PDA)-coated and perfluorohexane (PFH)-filled gold core/hollow mesoporous silica shell (Au@mSiO 2 -PFH-PDA, ASPP for short) particles for photoacoustic (PA)/ultrasound (US)/computed tomography (CT)/thermal imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors. In this work, we first synthesized Au seed particles with a diameter of 15.8 nm using a sodium citrate reduction method, and coated Au seeds with polyvinylpyrrolidone for further growth of solid silica shell/mesoporous silica outer shell onto the Au seeds. After treatment via selective etching to remove solid silica shell, amination of surface of the particles, and filling of PFH into the internal cavity of the spheres with a diameter of 182.1 nm, PDA coating was performed to render the particles with an external shell thickness of 15.1 nm. The formed hybrid particles with a size of 212.2 nm are colloidally stable and exhibit good cytocompatibility, and display excellent PA/US/CT/thermal imaging property due to the co-presence of PDA, PFH, and Au nanoparticles. Furthermore, the PDA coating renders the platform with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 61.2%, enabling effective photothermal ablation of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted 4T1 tumor model in vivo under irradiation with an 808 nm laser. More importantly, in the primary 4T1 tumor model, intratumoral injection of the ASPP and irradiation with an 808 nm laser can also completely inhibit the occurrence of lung metastasis induced by the 4T1 tumor. The as-prepared hybrid nanoplatform may hold a great promise to be adopted for multimode imaging and PTT of tumors and inhibition of tumor metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy has been the most widely used treatment against cancer, however, it is limited by its systemic toxicity as well as resistance developed by tumors' physical barriers. Herein, we propose a novel acoustically-mediated treatment regime to on-demand release therapeutics and disrupt tumor structures. By programming a high intensity focused ultrasound transducer, we can locally and digitally release gemcitabine (GEM) as well as open the local blood-tumor barrier or even tumor stroma to enhance intratumor drug delivery via acoustically-oscillating bubbles and liposomes. In our experiments, we modeled tumor endothelium by culturing a monolayer of murine endothelial cells (2H11) on transwell membrane. We locally disrupted the cultured endothelium to enhance drug penetration by using perfluorocarbon liquid droplets as breaking probes and protoporphyrin IX hybridized liposomes as drug carriers. We also demonstrated an on-demand release of GEM by digitally triggering the break of drug carriers. Moreover, we validated the acoustic tumor endothelium disruption in vivo by monitoring penetration of dye (Evans blue) in solid tumors. Therefore, we present an acoustically-mediated delivery method that both releases drug on-demand locally and opens the blood-tumor barrier to enhance drug penetration. This sets the ground for further clinical cancer therapy to improve many systemic cancer treatments.",

    "Abstract": "Telomerase is an important biomarker for cancer diagnosis and a valuable target for cancer therapy. Most of the reported telomerase assays suffer from the repeating thermal cycles, laborious protocols, expensive instruments and the limited sensitivity. To solve these issues, we develop a new telomerase assay based on telomerization-driven release of fluorescent 2-aminopurine. We designed a 2-aminopurine molecular beacon in which the fluorescence of 2-aminopurine is quenched due to stacking interaction effect without the use of extra quenchers. The presence of target telomerase can open the 2-aminopurine molecular beacon, triggering a quadratic signal amplification reaction to digest abundant 2-aminopurine molecular beacons, releasing large amounts of free 2-aminopurine molecules with strong fluorescence emission. Due to the inherent low background signal of 2-aminopurine molecular beacon and the highly efficient telomerization-driven quadratic signal amplification, this method exhibits high sensitivity with a limit of detection equivalent to 1 human lung cancer A549 cell and a large dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude from 1 to 10000 cells. Moreover, this method can be further applied for telomerase inhibition assay and the discrimination of cancer cells from normal cells, holding great potential in telomerase-related clinical diagnosis and drug discovery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ideal methods for miRNA detection should be rapid and amplification-free in the mix-and-measure format. Here we report a novel FRET strategy based on fluorescence-enhanced p19 proteins-conjugated single quantum dot (QD) with multiplex antenna for one-step, specific and sensitive miRNAs quantitative analysis. It is simple in design and operation, and possesses high sensitivity and selectivity. In the strategy, RNA-binding viral p19 proteins-conjugated quantum dot (p19-QD) with high fluorescence and multiplex antenna was designed, and exploited for the capture recognition element and the donor. In the presence of target miRNAs, the p19-QD would tightly capture the miRNA-21-antimiRNA-21 duplex (dsRNA) formed in solution by hybridization of the specific antimiRNA-21-Cy3 probe (receptor) to the single-stranded miRNA-21 target. The FRET detection system between QD and Cy3 was constructed, and the signal read-out was measured. Conversely, in the absence of target miRNA-21, the p19-QD refuse to capture the free single-stranded antimiRNA-21-Cy3 probe (receptor), the FRET between quantum dot and Cy3 is deterred, thereby providing a low-background signal to improve sensitivity. Benefiting from the high affinity and specificity of p19 protein for duplex RNA and the fluorescence enhancement of donor p19-QD by the passivation and protection from p19 protein, a detection limit as low as 0.6 fM was achieved without employing any amplification techniques and pre-concentration or purification steps. The performance can be achieved by only one-step incubation without additional reagents and washing steps, thus greatly reducing the operating difficulty and saving time. Moreover, the fluorescence-enhanced p19-QD conjugate-based FRET strategy avoids the specific design in the number of the bases for interval in the DNA-QD conjugate-based FRET system using DNA strands as the FRET linker, and improves the FRET efficiency. Furthermore, it has been successfully applied to analyze the content of miRNA-21 in breast cancer cell. The results indicated that, the strategy will become a sensitive and reliable miRNAs quantification method in biomedical research and early clinical diagnostics. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Immortalized cell lines used to produce vaccines are expected to be described in terms of their tumorigenicity. However, current in vivo tumorigenicity assays can be time-consuming and results can be equivocal, especially for weakly tumorigenic cells. Basement membrane extract (BME) derived from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor, such as Matrigel and Cultrex, consists of laminin, collagen IV, entactin, heparan sulfate, and proteoglycans, as well as biologically active peptides and growth factors. For nearly three decades, BME has been used in cancer research to enhance tumorigenicity assays (both tumor “take” as well as tumor growth are substantially improved). We assessed the feasibility of using BME to facilitate the evaluation of vaccine cell substrate tumorigenicity. Vero cells (WHO 10-87) were serially passaged and banked at every ten passages beginning with p140; for the present study, low-passage Vero cells (Vero LP, originating from cells banked at p140) and high-passage Vero cells (Vero HP, originating from cells banked at p250) were used. In addition, Vero TPX2 and Vero NM1, cell lines established from tumors formed in nude mice by Vero HP cells, as well as other cell lines relevant to vaccine production (HeLa, MDCK, 293, and ARPE-19), were assessed. Female adult athymic nude mice were injected subcutaneously with cells in the absence or presence of BME. We observed that the tumorigenicity of ARPE-19 cells as well as Vero cells below passage 258 (Vero LP and Vero HP; previously characterized as non-tumorigenic or weakly tumorigenic, respectively) was not enhanced by BME. In contrast, BME shortened the latency and decreased the tumor-producing cell dose of HeLa, 293, and MDCK cells as well as the tumorigenic Vero derivatives TPX2 and NM1. Thus, responsiveness to BME may reflect the status of the neoplastic process and possibly serve as a useful trait for better defining the tumorigenic phenotype of cells. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Thyroid cancer results from unregulated expansion of a self-renewing tumor-initiating cell population. The regulatory pathways essential for sustaining the self-renewal of tumor-initiating cells remain largely unknown. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a vital role in tumor initiation and progression. In the present study, we found that the level of ROS was higher in CD133 + thyroid cancer cells than in CD133- thyroid cancer cells. The transcriptional level of ROS-generating oxidase NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) is high in CD133 + thyroid cancer cells. Activation of STAT3 through phosphorylation is responsible for high activation of NOX1 transcription in CD133 + thyroid cancer cells. Knock down of NOX1 obviously reduced the level of ROS and inhibited the self-renewal activity and tumorigenicity of CD133 + thyroid cancer cells. Furthermore, knock down of NOX1 reduced the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway. Overexpression of active form of Akt rescued the negative effect of NOX1 knockdown on the self-renewal capability of CD133 + thyroid cancer cells. Together, NOX1 promotes the self-renewal property of CD133 + thyroid cancer cells at least partly through activation of the Akt signaling. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is amplified in about 20% breast cancers. Treat of HER2 positive breast cancers has been greatly promoted in last few years, but the accompany HER2 blockade has hindered the therapeutic effect. Pyrotinib is a pan-HER kinase inhibitor that suppresses signaling through the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor that inhibits cell cycle progression and cancer cell proliferation in ER+ breast cancers. We hypothesized that the combination of pan-HER kinase inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors would show synergistic antitumor activity in vivo in vitro. Our data show that a combination of palbociclib and pyrotinib was highly synergistic in inhibiting cancer proliferation and colony formation. The combined treatment also induced significant decreases in pAKT and pHER3 activation, induced G0-G1 cell cycle arrest, and increased rates of apoptosis. In the xenograft model, the combination treatment demonstrated greater antitumor activity than either agent alone, with no apparent increase in toxicity. Our results offer a preclinical rationale clinical investigation of the effectiveness of a combination treatment of palbociclib with pyrotinib for breast cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive heterogeneous disease with a divergent profile. It has an earlier tendency to form metastases and is associated with poor clinical outcomes due to the limited treatment options available. Heat-shock protein (HSP90) represents a potential treatment target as it promotes tumor progression and metastasis by modulating the maturation and stabilization of signal transduction proteins. We sought to investigate the efficacy of the C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor L80 on cell proliferation, breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)-like properties, tumor growth and metastasis. L80 suppressed cell viability and concomitantly inhibited AKT/MEK/ERK/JAK2/STAT3 signaling in TNBC cells but did not induce cytotoxicity in normal cells. L80 effectively targeted BCSC-like traits, together with significant reductions in the CD44high/CD24low-population, ALDH1 activity and mammosphere forming-ability. In support of the in vitro observations, L80 administration caused significant impairment in tumor growth, angiogenesis and distant metastases in an orthotopic allograft model with BCSC-enriched cells in vivo. These phenomena were associated with the suppression of BCSC-like characteristics and STAT3 dysfunction. Our findings highlight properties of the L80 compound that may be useful in suppressing metastatic TNBC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Somatic epigenetic inactivation of the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is frequent in colorectal cancer (CRC); however, its involvement in CRC predisposition remains unexplored. We assessed the role and relevance of MGMT germline mutations and epimutations in familial and early-onset CRC. Mutation and promoter methylation screenings were performed in 473 familial and/or early-onset mismatch repair-proficient nonpolyposis CRC cases. No constitutional MGMT inactivation by promoter methylation was observed. Of six rare heterozygous germline variants identified, c.346C > T (p.H116Y) and c.476G > A (p.R159Q), detected in three and one families respectively, affected highly conserved residues and showed segregation with cancer in available family members. In vitro, neither p.H116Y nor p.R159Q caused statistically significant reduction of MGMT repair activity. No evidence of somatic second hits was found in the studied tumors. Case-control data showed over-representation of c.346C > T (p.H116Y) in familial CRC compared to controls, but no overall association of MGMT mutations with CRC predisposition. In conclusion, germline mutations and constitutional epimutations in MGMT are not major players in hereditary CRC. Nevertheless, the over-representation of c.346C > T (p.H116Y) in our familial CRC cohort warrants further research. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the compounds present in the marijuana plant, has anti-tumor properties, but its mechanism is not well known. This study aimed to evaluate the apoptotic action of CBD in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, and focused on its effects on the novel pro-apoptotic Noxa-reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway. CBD experiments were performed using the CRC cell lines HCT116 and DLD-1. CBD induced apoptosis by regulating many pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, of which Noxa showed significantly higher expression. To understand the relationship between Noxa and CBD-induced apoptosis, Noxa levels were downregulated using siRNA, and the expression of apoptosis markers decreased. After ROS production was blocked, the level of Noxa also decreased, suggesting that ROS is involved in the regulation of Noxa, which along with ROS is a well-known pro-apoptotic signaling agents. As a result, CBD induced apoptosis in a Noxa-and-ROS-dependent manner. Taken together, the results obtained in this study re-demonstrated the effects of CBD treatment in vivo, thus confirming its role as a novel, reliable anticancer drug. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Our results suggest for the first time that RLIP inhibition/depletion suppresses primary breast tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.Breast tumor metastasis is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Breast cancer (BC) cells frequently metastasize to the lungs, where they pose a formidable therapeutic challenge. In the current study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of 2′-hydroxyflavanone (2HF) and RLIP inhibition in an array of triple-negative BC cell lines and an orthotopic mouse model of breast-to-lung metastasis. Compared to control treatment, RLIP inhibition reduced in-vitro cell viability and suppressed the migratory and invasive potential of BC cells. In-vitro studies showed that 2HF treatment reduced the expression of RLIP, KRAS, pERK, pSTAT3, and pP70S6K. Further, mice orthotopically implanted with lung-seeking luciferase-expressing TMD231 cells were treated with 2HF (50 mg/kg, b.w.), RLIP antisense (RAS; 5 mg/kg, b.w.), RLIP antibody (Rab; 5 mg/kg, b.w.) or a combination of 2HF + RAS + Rab. 2HF-, RAS-, and Rab-treated mice exhibited significantly lower primary tumor weight and reduced lung metastasis compared to control mice. Mice treated with a combination of 2HF + RAS + Rab exhibited no metastasis and significantly lower tumor weight than the single agent-treated mice.

    "Abstract": "L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) promotes invasiveness and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and is upregulated by the p53-regulated transcription factor Slug. p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) directly phosphorylates Slug, resulting in pro-malignant Slug stabilization. We hypothesized that microRNA-based negative regulation of PAK4 would reduce L1CAM-induced NSCLC aggressiveness via destabilizing Slug. We found that elevated L1CAM expression was tightly correlated with p53 loss-of-function and reduced NSCLC patient survival. L1CAM suppression reduced NSCLC cell migration and invasiveness in vitro as well as tumor formation and distal metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, p53 restricts L1CAM expression through the β-catenin/Slug pathway, with levels of β-catenin and Slug positively correlating with L1CAM expression in NSCLC tumors. The microRNA miR-193a-3p directly targets PAK4 and suppresses downstream p-Slug and L1CAM expression. Silencing PAK4, Slug, and L1CAM mirrored miR-193a-3p's effects upon the migration and invasiveness of NSCLC cells in vitro. Decreased miR-193a-3p levels correlated with elevated PAK4, p-Slug, and L1CAM levels in NSCLC tumors. Our findings support a model of miR-193a-3p as a suppressor of metastatic disease progression in NSCLC via modulation of the p53/Slug/L1CAM pathway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor cells can escape immune surveillance through the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis suppressing T cells. However, we recently demonstrated that high-affinity variants of soluble human programmed death-ligand 1 (shPD-L1) could diminish the suppression. We propose that in comparison to the wild-type shPD-L1, the further affinity enhancement will confer the molecule with opposite characteristics that augment T-cell activation and immunotherapeutic drug potential. In this study, a new shPD-L1 variant, L3C7c, has been generated to demonstrate ∼167 fold greater affinity than wild-type hPD-L1. The L3C7c-Fc fusion protein demonstrated completely opposite effects of conventional PD-1 axis by promoting redirected T-cell proliferation, activation and cytotoxicity in vitro, as being slightly better than that of anti-PD1-Ab (Pembrolizumab). Moreover, L3C7c-Fc was more effective than Pembrolizumab in enhancing redirected T cells’ ability to suppress Mel624 melanoma growth in vivo. As a downsized L3C7c-Fc variant, L3C7v-Fc improved the anti-tumor efficacy in vivo when combined with dendritic cell vaccines. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that high-affinity hPD-L1 variants could be developed as the next generation reagents for tumor immunotherapy based on the blockade of the PD-1 axis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment of numerous prevalent cancer types is abundantly infiltrated with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Macrophage mannose receptor (MMR or CD206) expressing TAMs have been shown to be key promoters of tumor progression and major opponents of successful cancer therapy. Therefore, depleting MMR + TAMs is an interesting approach to synergize with current antitumor therapies. We studied the potential of single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) specific for MMR to target proteins to MMR + TAMs. Anti-MMR sdAbs were genetically coupled to a reporter protein, mWasabi (wasabi green, WG), generating sdAb “drug” fusion proteins (SFPs), referred to as WG-SFPs. The resulting WG-SFPs were highly efficient in targeting MMR + macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. As we showed that second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) mimetics modulate MMR + macrophages, we further coupled the anti-MMR sdAb to an active form of SMAC, referred to as tSMAC. The resulting tSMAC-SFPs were able to bind and upregulate caspase3/7 activity in MMR + macrophages in vitro. In conclusion, we report the proof-of-concept of an elegant approach to conjugate anti-MMR sdAbs to proteins, which opens new avenues for targeted manipulation of MMR + tumor-promoting TAMs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The electrochemical behavior of osmociphenol (3, Oc-OH), an organometallic osmium-based anticancer drug candidate, has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry in the absence and presence of lutidine used as a base model. Osmociphenol exhibited spontaneous deprotonation of the phenol function upon oxidation of the osmocene moiety due to its high acidity. In the presence of lutidine, a base-dependent and different electrochemical behavior was observed at low scan rates indicating a second oxidation step leading to the corresponding cationic quinone methide precursor (3b + ). However, compared to ruthenocene derivatives, the stability of 3b + prevented its conversion into quinone methide as the final and stable complex. Despite differences in their oxidative processes, osmociphenol and ruthenociphenol derivatives exhibit similar biological activities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Contaminants in road dusts can directly pose significant human health risks through oral ingestion, particle inhalation, and dermal contact. Therefore, this study has been designed to analyze heavy metal contaminations in 88 street dusts collected from the 22 high traffic sites and industrial areas of the Southeast Asian Megacity: Dhaka (capital of Bangladesh) using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectroscopy. This study revealed that the maximum Pb, Cd, Zn, Cr, Ni, As, Mn and Cu contents in the street dust samples were 18.9, 11.6, 239.2, 144.3, 37.1, 8.1, 261.5 and 49.6 mg/ kg respectively in which Ni and Pb concentration were 2 times, and Cd concentration was 200 times higher than the background level in soil; and As concentration was slightly higher than soil background level. The spatial distribution of heavy metal concentrations in street dust samples in Dhaka City was revealed that the hot spot areas of Pb, Ni, Cd and As were mainly associated with heavy traffic and industrial activities. The risk assessment strategies were used for this study for identifying the routes of exposure through oral ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact by the fine particles (~75 μm) of street dust, especially for children based on the US EPA health risk models. Both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of heavy metals were characterized in street dust samples. Results based on the hazard index (HI), in the case of non-cancer effect, the ingestion of dust particles of children and adults in Dhaka City appeared to be the route of exposure to street dust that results in a higher risk for heavy metals, followed by dermal contact. This study revealed that the inhalation of re-suspended particles through mouth and nose were almost negligible. It was also noticed that children were experiencing the potential health risk due to HI for Cr (1.04), which was slightly higher than the safe level 1, and Cd (0.69) was close to the safe level 1. Reversely, cancer risk for Cr (i.e. 4.27 × 10 −6 ) was fallen within the range of threshold values (10 −4 to 10 −6 ) and As (i.e. 9.59 × 10 −7 ) was close to the upper limit of threshold values (10 −4 to 10 −6 ). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a pivotal role in tumor progression. Rpn10 is the major ubiquitin (Ub) receptor of the 26S proteasome. Mounting evidence shows that Rpn10 is associated with the progression of several tumor types. However, little is known regarding the mechanistic role of Rpn10 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we found that the upregulation of Rpn10 in HCC was associated with poor prognosis. The ectopic overexpression of Rpn10 increased HCC cell proliferation, whereas silencing Rpn10 expression resulted in decreased cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockdown of Rpn10 induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in HCC cells. In addition, we found that Rpn10 increased cell proliferation via regulation of the PTEN/Akt pathways. Knockdown of Rpn10 induced suppression of cell proliferation could be reversed by overexpressing active Akt in HCC cells. Rpn10 directly promoted PTEN degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The transcription factor HIF1α directly bound to the Rpn10 promoter and increased its expression in HCC tissue. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between HIF1α expression and Rpn10 levels in HCC patients and found that the combination of these two parameters was a more powerful predictor of poor prognosis than either parameter alone. Collectively, these findings highlight the molecular mechanism of Rpn10 expression in HCC and provide valuable information for cancer prognosis and treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Based on analysis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BART microRNA expression profiles, we previously reported that EBV-encoded miR-BART13 is upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) plasma specimens. However, the effects and molecular mechanisms of miR-BART13 in NPC remain largely unknown. We found that miR-BART13 was significantly upregulated in NPC tissue specimens. Ectopic expression of miR-BART13 promoted NPC cell proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and metastasis in vitro, and facilitated xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Molecularly, NF-κB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 2 (NKIRAS2), a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling, was identified to be a direct target of miR-BART13 in NPC cells, and NKIRAS2 mRNA and protein expression was inversely correlated with miR-BART13 in NPC tissues, respecitvely. Furthermore, the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by miR-BART13. By rescued experiments, reconstitution of NKIRAS2 expression abrogated all the phenotypes upregulated by miR-BART13, and attenuated activity of NF-κB signaling pathway activated by miR-BART13 in NPC cells. Our findings indicated the newly identified miR-BART13/NKIRAS2/NF-κB signaling axis may provide further insights into better understanding of NPC initiation and development, and targeting of this pathway could be further studied as a therapeutic strategy for NPC patients. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Building-Integrated Photovoltaic/Thermal (BIPVT) technology offers multiple advantages; however, these types of installations include materials such as Photovoltaic (PV) cells and metals which considerably influence BIPVT environmental impact. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate BIPVT environmental profile, for instance by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In light of the issues mentioned above, the present article is an LCA study that assesses the environmental performance of a BIPVT prototype that has been developed and patented at the Ulster University (Belfast, UK). The investigation places emphasis on material manufacturing, based on Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), Global Warming Potential (GWP), ReCiPe, Ecological footprint and USEtox. The results show that according to all the adopted methods/environmental indicators and based on primary materials, the PV cells and the two vessels (steel) are the components with the three highest impacts. Scenarios which include recycling of steel, plastics and brass (landfill for the other materials has been assumed), based on CED, GWP 100a and ReCiPe endpoint, have been examined. It was found that steel recycling offers a considerable impact reduction, ranging from 47% to 85%. Furthermore, the impact of the proposed BIPVT module per m 2 of thermal absorber has been calculated. The results, based on primary materials, show 4.92 GJ prim /m 2 and 0.34 t CO 2.eq /m 2 (GWP 100a). In addition, according to USEtox/ecotoxicity, USEtox/human toxicity-non-cancer (scenario based on primary materials), the PV cells present the highest contributions to the total impact of the module: 55% in terms of ecotoxicity and 86% concerning human toxicity/non-cancer. A comparison with literature is provided. Moreover, a separate section of the article is about factors which influence BIPVT environmental profile, discussing parameters such as the storage materials and the end-of-life management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is an aggressive disease with 5-year survival rates of <20%. Only 20–30% OAC patients show a beneficial response to neoadjuvant therapy. Altered mitochondrial function is linked with radioresistance in OAC. We identified pyrazinib (P3), a pyrazine phenol small molecule drug with anti-angiogenic and anti-metabolic activity in-vivo in zebrafish and in-vitro isogenic models of OAC radioresistance. Pyrazinib (P3) significantly inhibited blood vessel development in zebrafish (p < 0.001). In-vivo in zebrafish and in-vitro in an isogenic model of OAC radioresistance, pyrazinib (P3) significantly reduced measures of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Pyrazinib (P3) significantly reduced the surviving fraction in OE33P; radiation-sensitive and OE33R; radiation-resistant cells following irradiation. Under hypoxic conditions pyrazinib (P3) significantly reduced OE33R cell survival following 4 Gy irradiation (p = 0.0216). Multiplex ELISA showed significantly higher secreted levels of 9 of 30 detected inflammatory and angiogenic factors in OE33R radioresistant cells compared to OE33P cells; IL-8, IL-4, IL-6, IL-2, IL-12p70, IL-10, MCP-1, IP-10, ICAM (p < 0.05). Pyrazinib (P3) significantly reduced the secretions of IL-6 (p = 0.0006), IL-8 (p = 0.0488), and IL-4 (p = 0.0111) in OE33R cells. Collectively, these findings support further development of pyrazinib (P3) as a novel therapeutic radiosensitiser in OAC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Although novel targeted therapies have significantly improved the overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma, understanding and combatting drug resistance remains a major clinical challenge. Using partial differential equations, we describe the evolution of a cellular population through time, space, and phenotype dimensions, in the presence of various drug species. We then use this framework to explore models in which resistance is attained by either mutations (irreversible) or plasticity (reversible). Numerical results suggest that punctuated evolutionary assumptions are more consistent with results obtained from murine melanoma models than gradual evolution. Furthermore, in the context of an evolving tumour cell population, sequencing the treatment, for instance applying immunotherapy before BRAF inhibitors, can increase treatment effectiveness. However, drug strategies which showed success within a spatially homogeneous tumour environment were unsuccessful under heterogeneous conditions, suggesting that spatio-environmental heterogeneity may be the greatest challenge to tumour therapies. Plastic metabolic models are additionally capable of reproducing the characteristic resistant tumour volume curves and predicting re-sensitisation to secondary waves of treatment observed in patient derived xenograft (PDX) melanomas treated with MEK and BRAF inhibitors. Nevertheless, secondary relapse due to a pre-adapted subpopulation, remaining after the first wave of treatment, results in a more rapid development of resistance. Our model provides a framework through which tumour resistance can be understood and would suggest that carefully phased treatments may be able to overcome the development of long-term resistance in melanoma. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Apoptosis is downregulated in all forms of cancers. The mitochondrion has been implicated in the apoptotic process and, recently has been targeted in cancer therapy because of its role in cancer progression. Medicinal plants are used in the treatment of cancer, in particular, Calliandra portoricensis (CP) in the management of prostate cancer in Nigeria ethnomedicine. Aim of the study: This study was designed to investigate the effects of CP on mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and cell proliferation using prostate cancer cells. Materials and methods: Prostatic LNCaP, DU-145, lung adenocarcinoma and healthy VERO cells were used to assess cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Levels of pro-apoptotic Bax, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Cytochrome C Release (CCR) and activation of caspases 3(C3) and 9 (C9) were determined by ELISA, while mitochondrial integrity was evaluated by Fluorescent Intensity Ratio (FIR). Results: Methanol Fraction of C. portoricensis (MFCP) inhibited proliferation of prostatic LNCaP, DU-145, lung adenocarcinoma and healthy VERO cells with IC50 values of 2.4 ± 0.2, 3.3 ± 0.2, 3.6 ± 0.2 and 17.9 ± 1.6 µg/mL, respectively. The growth inhibition by MFCP correlated with a 3-fold decreased expression of Bcl-2 and a 4-fold increase in Bax levels at 10 µg/mL in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, MFCP caused a 3.5-fold reduction in FIR at 10 µg/mL and induced CCR by 4.2 folds at the same concentration relative to control. The MFCP-induced CCR is associated with activation of C3 and C9 at 10 µg/mL by 4.2 and 5.1 folds, respectively which prompted cancer cells to arrest at S phase. The LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of polyphenols including gallic acid and afzelechin in MFCP. Conclusion: Taken together, MFCP- induced cell death is mediated by alteration of mitochondrial integrity and cell cycle arrest. Hence, methanol fraction of C. portoricensis may be effective for cancer pharmacotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Strobilanthes crispus (L.) Blume, locally known in Malaysia as “Pecah kaca” or “Jin batu”, has been traditionally used for treatment of various ailments including cancer. We previously demonstrated that a standardized bioactive subfraction of S. crispus, termed as F3, possessed potent anticancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Aim of the study: To investigate the potential of F3 from S. crispus to prevent metastasis in breast cancer. Materials and methods: The antimetastatic effects of F3 were first investigated on murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell (BCC) lines using cell proliferation, wound healing and invasion assays. A 4T1-induced mouse mammary carcinoma model was then used to determine the expression of metastasis tumor markers, epithelial (E)-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, mucin (MUC)-1, nonepithelial (N)-cadherin, Twist, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vimentin, using immunohistochemistry, following oral treatment with F3 for 30 days. Results: Significant growth arrest was observed with F3 IC50 values of 84.27 µg/ml (24 h) and 74.41 µg/ml (48 h) for MDA-MB-231, and 87.35 µg/ml (24 h) and 78.75 µg/ml (48 h) for 4T1 cells. F3 significantly inhibited migration of both BCC lines at 50 μg/ml for 24 h (p = 0.018 and p = 0.015, respectively). Similarly, significant inhibition of invasion was demonstrated in 4T1 (75 µg/ml, p = 0.016) and MDA-MB-231 (50 µg/ml, p = 0.040) cells compared to the untreated cultures. F3 treatment resulted in reduced tumor growth compared to untreated mice (p &lt; 0.01) or mice treated with tamoxifen (p &lt; 0.05). Statistical parameters (absolute count, proportion, intensity and overall scores) indicating upregulation of E-cadherin expression were statistically significant in F3-treated compared to the untreated tumor-bearing mice. Similarly, F3 significantly reduced the expression of MMP-9, MUC1, N-cadherin, Twist, VEGF and vimentin in comparison with the TM (p &lt; 0.01) group Conclusions: Our findings suggest that F3 exerts anti-metastatic effects independent of its cytotoxic effects, and these are supported by the increased expression of E-cadherin concurrent with downregulation of MMP-9, MUC1, N-cadherin, Twist, VEGF and vimentin expression in breast cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Sijunzi decoction is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) commonly used for invigorating vital energy and for the enhancement of immunity. Modified Sijunzi decoctions have been extensively used to treat cachexia and improve the quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Aim of the study: This study was aimed to provide comprehensive evidence for the anti-cachectic effect of a modified Sijunzi decoction (Zhen-Qi; ZQ-SJZ) and characterize its anti-cachectic mechanism, especially in cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy. Materials and methods: We employed a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-induced cancer cachectic mouse model to demonstrate the anti-cachectic effect of ZQ-SJZ. Moreover, we provided an in vitro C2C12 myotube formation model to investigate the effect of ZQ-SJZ in hampering cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy. Results: The administration of ZQ-SJZ can recover tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced body weight loss, intestinal mucosal damage, as well as forelimb grip strength and myofiber size. The administration of ZQ-SJZ also significantly prolonged the survival of LLC-induced cachectic mice under cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, ZQ-SJZ increased the levels of myogenic proteins, such as myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and myogenin, and decreased the atrophy-related protein, atrogin-1, in cisplatin-treated C2C12 myotubes in vitro. In addition, cisplatin-induced mitochondria dysfunction could be hampered by the co-administration of ZQ-SJZ, by which it recovered the cisplatin-mediated decrease in PGC-1α and PKM1 levels. Conclusions: The administration of ZQ-SJZ can recover tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced cachectic conditions and significantly prolong the survival of LLC-induced cachectic mice under cisplatin treatment. The profound effect of ZQ-SJZ in hampering tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced cachexia may be due to its modulation of the mitochondrial function and subsequent myogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrated the anti-cachectic mechanism of ZQ-SJZ and its potential use as a palliative strategy to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Strychnos nux-vomica L. (Loganiaceae) is grown extensively in South Asian. The dried seed of this plant, nux vomica, has been clinically used in Chinese medicine for relieving rheumatic pain, reducing swelling and treating cancer. Brucine, the second abundant alkaloid constituent of nux vomica, shows excellent clinical therapeutic effect, especially in relieving pain, but mechanism of brucine in relieving pain is still unclear. Aim of the study: Explore the analgesic effect of brucine, reveal the molecular mechanism of brucine analgesia. Materials and methods: Antinociceptive effects of brucine were assessed in acute and chronic pain mice model. Electrophysiological experiments were used to evaluate the effects of brucine on neuronal activity and sodium channel function. Results: In acute pain models, brucine significantly inhibits response induced by nociceptive heat and mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, thermal hypersensitivity and mechanical allodynia were also alleviated by brucine treatment in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) mouse model. Sodium channel plays a crucial role in neuropathic pain. Electrophysiological results show that brucine inhibits the excitability of DRG neurons directly, the number of action potential (AP) was significantly reduced after brucine treatment, and this kind of inhibition is due to brucine inhibits both tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTXs) and tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTXr) sodium channel. Conclusions: Taken together, brucine is a novel drug candidate in treating acute and chronic pain diseases, which might be attributed to inhibition the excitability of sodium channel directly. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Kiwifruit is native to eastern China and many are the references about the consumption of fruits and fruits extracts of the Actinidia plants in Chinese traditional medicine as therapeutic food supplements to prevent and/or counteract numerous disorders including inflammation-related diseases like cancer. Aim of the study: Aim of the present work was to obtain a kiwifruit peel extract, rich in polyphenols, and to explore the anti-inflammatory potential by analyzing its capability to target multiple pathways involved in monocyte-mediated inflammatory response. Materials and methods: The extract was obtained from the fruit peel of Actinidia deliciosa (A.Chev.) C.F.Liang & A.R.Ferguson, cv Hayward and characterized by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 monocytes were used as a model of human inflammation in vitro. Results: Analytical data evidenced that procyanidins resulted the main polyphenols present in the extract, representing the 92% w/w of the total. The extract inhibited the production of inflammatory molecules such as IL-6, IL-1β TNF-α pro-inflammatory cytokines, HMGB1 danger signal and granzyme B serine protease by activated monocytes. In particular, an inhibitory activity of 81%, 68%, 63%, 76% and 60% on the extracellular release of IL-6, IL-1β TNF-α HMGB1 and granzyme B, respectively, was observed by western blot analysis. Moreover, the extract prevented STAT3 activation and promoted autophagy. Conclusions: The reported findings demonstrated a strong and broad anti-inflammatory profile of the kiwifruit peel extract, which makes it a promising preventive and therapeutic natural ingredient for nutraceutical, cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations to counteract multiple inflammatory disorders. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: The oleoresin of Brazilian Copaifera reticulata is a traditional remedy used for the treatment of skin and urinary tract infections, respiratory diseases, rheumatism, ulcer and tumours; thus, playing an important role in the primary health care of the indigenous population. Aim: As most previous pharmacological tests used the crude oleoresin and only a few studies so far dealt with enriched fractions or pure chemically defined compounds, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of the Copaifera reticulata oleoresin and to assign traditional uses to specific secondary metabolites. Materials and methods: The oleoresin, as well as its neutral and acidic fractions were tested for their activity against six cancer cell lines, two clinically relevant bacterial strains, and two dermatophytes. Both fractions were analysed by GC-MS and UHPLC-ELSD, respectively. The antibacterial acidic phase was further fractionated by preparative chromatography to purify and characterize the compounds responsible for the observed pharmacological effect. Results: Whereas no cytotoxic activity was detected, the crude oleoresin and its acidic fraction showed antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium (IC 50 values 4.2 and 4.8 µg/mL, respectively) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, IC 50 values 5.3 and 7.2 µg/mL, respectively). Purification of the acidic fraction of the C. reticulata oleoresin yielded two dicarboxylic diterpene acids and the four main diterpene acids, comprising three different diterpene scaffolds. Interestingly, the activity was not restricted to a particular diterpene-type but rather depended on the compounds’ lipophilicity, with the most active constituent showing IC 50 values of 1.6 (E. faecium) and 2.5 µg/mL (MRSA), respectively. Furthermore, ent-polyalthic acid, the major diterpenoid, was significantly active against dermatophytes with IC 50 values of 6.8 µg/mL (Trichophyton rubrum) and 4.3 µg/mL against (T. mentagrophytes). Conclusion: The present study proved the antimicrobial effects of the C. reticulata oleoresin and its diterpenoid constituents, confirming its wide use in folk medicine for the treatment of skin and urinary tract infections. The inhibitory activity of copaiba diterpenoids against dermatophytic fungi as well as the gram-positive bacteria E. faecium and MRSA is being reported for the first time, providing potential lead structures for the treatment of these clinically relevant bacterial strains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Metastasis poses a long-standing treatment challenge for many cancers including breast cancer. Once spreading out, cell-selective delivery of drug appears especially critical. Here, we report on epidermal growth factor receptor and CD44 dual-targeted hyaluronic acid nanogels (EGFR/CD44-NGs) that afford enhanced targetability and protein therapy for metastatic 4T1 breast cancer in vivo. Flow cytometry in CD44 and EGFR-positive 4T1 metastatic breast cancer cells showed over 6-fold higher cellular uptake of EGFR/CD44-NGs than mono-targeting CD44-NGs. MTT and scratch assays displayed that saporin-loaded EGFR/CD44-NGs (Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs) was highly potent in inhibiting growth as well as migration of 4T1 cells in vitro, with an IC 50 of 5.36 nM, which was 1.7-fold lower than that for Sap-CD44-NGs. In 4T1-luc metastatic breast cancer model in mice, Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs exhibited significant inhibition of tumor metastasis to lung at a small dose of 3.33 nmol Sap equiv./kg. Increasing the dosage to 13.3 nmol Sap equiv./kg resulted in further reduced lung metastasis without causing notable adverse effects. These dual-targeted nanogels with improved cancer cell selectivity provide a novel platform for combating breast cancer metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer comes second among the causes of cancer deaths of women. Although new generation hormone therapy is a promising strategy, re-occurrence or emergence of drug resistance limits the success. According to the theory of cancer stem cells (CSCs); CSCs are immortal, tumor inducing and self renewing pluripotent cells and multiply as chemotherapy proceeds, making the chemotherapy inefficient. Emerging scientific reports indicate that the mechanisms of drug resistance are the main features that CSCs gain actually. Due to this fact, cancer stem cell markers should be clarified to target CSCs and this will play important role to reverse drug resistance. In this study, MCF-7/Pac, a cell line resistant to microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel and multiple drugs permanently, was used as a reference cell line for drug resistant mammary cancer. It has some properties that breast cancer stem cells possess so it is considerable to isolate breast cancer stem cell-like cells from MCF-7/Pac population. The chemotherapy resistant breast cancer stem–like (BCSC-like) cells were sorted from MCF-7/Pac population by using markers CD44, CD24 and ALDH. At the next step the proteins that are up-regulated in BCSC-like cells were determined by protein array analysis. Additionally the effect of paclitaxel on BCSC-like cell proliferation was determined. The MCF-7/Pac population contains 12.4% BCSC-like cells. The cells bearing BCSC-like cell phenotype exhibited resistance to paclitaxel. The over-expressed growth factors, MMP proteins, Frizzled proteins and IL-23 were found to be related to the BCSC-like cell proliferation. These results will guide both basic science and medical science. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Targeting mitochondria using proper pharmacological agents is considered an attractive strategy for cancer control and management. Herein, we report a newly synthetic triazole analog of Jaridonin, DN3, which exhibits more potent antitumor activity via acting directly on mitochondria. DN3 potently reduced viabilities of gastric cancer cell lines HGC-27 and MGC-803 through inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. But, normal human gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 is more resistant to the growth inhibition by DN3 compared with gastric cancer cells. DN3 induced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decrease and cytochrome c release in intact gastric cancer cell lines. Meanwhile, the DN3 treatment also caused the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria isolated from cancer cell lines in a mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) mediated manner, but not from mitochondria isolated from normal gastric epithelial cell. The induction of mitochondrial PTPC proteins voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and cyclophilin D (CypD) were also observed in DN3-treated cells. More interestingly, DN3 mediated MMP decrease, release of cytochrome c, the expression of VDAC and CypD and apoptosis were blocked by the pretreatment of VDAC1 inhibitor (4, 4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, DIDS) and CypD inhibitor (cyclosporine A, CsA). In a mouse xenograft model of human gastric cancer, the treatment of 5 mg/kg DN3 led to significant tumor regression without affecting body weight. In conclusion, our findings indicate that DN3 is a potential agent for the treatment of gastric cancer through acting directly on mitochondria, and would be useful for us to design more and better anti-cancer compounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic properties of metformin combined with nelfinavir remain elusive. To explore this question, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the combinatorial effect of inducing autophagosome formation in human cervical cancer cells. Western blotting respectively assayed protein expression of LC3I, LC3II, Beclin-1, Autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg7), Autophagy-related protein 3 (Atg3), NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) and major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay evaluated natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity in the presence of metformin and nelfinavir in combination or each drug alone. Using tumor xenografts in a nude mouse model, antitumor efficacy of the drug combination was assessed. We found that the drug combination could induce autophagosome formation in human cervical cancer cells. The biomarker proteins of autophagy, including Beclin-1, Atg7 and Atg3, decreased, but the ratios of LC3I/II increased. We also found that this drug combination sensitizes human cervical cancer cells to NK cell-mediated lysis by increasing the protein of SIRT3 and MICA. Moreover, this drug combination markedly induced autophagy of SiHa xenografts in nude mice. Therefore, it can be concluded that metformin, in combination with nelfinavir, can induce SIRT3/mROS-dependent autophagy and sensitize NK cell-mediated lysis in human cervical cancer cells and cervical cancer cell xenografts in nude mice. Thus, our findings have revealed the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of metformin in combination with nelfinavir in cervical cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The anticancer activity of chalcones and their analogs is the most important biological activity of them among their broad spectrum of their biological activity. In this investigation, we performed quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling of the anticancer activity of 134 chalcones and their analogs against MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines using Monte Carlo method. QSAR models were calculated by CORAL software and optimal descriptors were calculated with SMILES and hydrogen suppressed molecular graph (HSG). The total dataset split into training, invisible training, calibration, and validation set randomly. Analysis of three probes of the Monte Carlo optimization with three random splits was done. Results from three random splits displayed robust, very simple, predictable, and reliable models for training, invisible training, calibration, and validation set with the correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.8142–0.8244, 0.8244–0.8699, 0.8125–0.8627 and 0.8290–0.8686 respectively. As a result, the obtained models help to identify the hybrid descriptors for the increase and the decrease of anticancer activity of chalcones against MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines. This simple QSAR model can be used for prediction of log IC 50 of numerous chalcone derivatives against breast cancer cell. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Myotubularin-related protein 14 (MTMR14) is a member of the myotubularin (MTM)-related protein family and plays a key role in cardiomyopathy and autophagy. However, its potential implication in human cancer is unclear. In this study, we have investigated the expression profile of MTMR14 and its functional impact in liver cancer for the first time. Expression analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that MTMR14 expression is obviously overexpressed in liver cancer, and positively correlated with clinical stage. A loss-of-function study showed that knockdown of MTMR14 promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell migration. MTMR14 knockdown also inhibits tumor migration in vivo in liver cancer peritoneal implantation nude mouse model. A molecular mechanistic study by western blot showed that Knockdown MTMR14 causes downregulation of N-cadherin and E-cadherin, and promotes the cleavage and activation of caspase12, caspase9 and caspase3, but excluding caspase8. These results suggest that MTMR14 affects cell migration through N-cadherin and E-cadherin. Additionally, MTMR14 affects cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway but not the death receptor pathway. Herein, our results indicate MTMR14 could have an oncogenic role in human liver cancer and thus demonstrates its potential as a target for the diagnosis and/or treatment of liver cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Continuing our investigation into the structure-activity relationship of antiproliferative macrocyclic nannocystins, we describe herein total synthesis of all four stereoisomers of Br-nannocystins as well as a simplified analogue varying at the polyketide C10 and C11 positions. Biological evaluation of these compounds against PANC1 cancer cell lines showed that both the (10R,11S) configuration and its associated two substituents are crucial for high potency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

As a result, this rule might not be suited to predicting druggability of macrocycles. To address this issue, a set of new criteria were recently proposed specifically for the design of synthetic macrocycles, see reference [2]; Marsault, E., Peterson, M.L., (2011) J. Med. Chem., 54, pp. 1961-2004",

    "Abstract": "Astaxanthin and alpha-tocopherol have various biological potential with induction of intracellular ROS production in cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial site. The present study was performed to prepare nanoemulsion (NEs) formulation of astaxanthin and alpha-tocopherol with sodium caseinate (AS-AT/SC NEs) using spontaneous emulsification and ultrasonication for analyzing intracellular ROS production in apoptosis. NEs was characterized with standard analysis, which revealed a high stability of normal pH with a small size and unique zeta potential of spherical structure droplets with no toxicity and faster cell migration. It induced ROS production and confirmed using fluorescent stains due to their unique physicochemical and functional properties. Therefore, it played a significant role in the induction of oxidative stress inside the cell as dose-dependent cytotoxicity at different concentrations. AS-AT/SC NEs with protective effect in maintaining intracellular ROS, oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane potential to reduced apoptosis morphology in cancer cells through mitochondria-mediated apoptosis that inhibits cell death, thus cell survival was initiated at greater extent. Thereby exhibiting a significant remarkable therapeutic effect in cancer field. To best of our knowledge, this is first study concluded that induction of apoptosis potential by AS-AT/SC NEs emerged as a potential way to eradicate cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common cause of lung cancer-related deaths. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play an essential role in cancer development and progression. In this study, we identified PILAR1, a prognostic and overexpressed LncRNA, using multiple independent datasets of LUAD patients. Higher expression of PILAR1 was associated with survival in Dhanasekaran et al. (HR = 2.29, p-value = 0.017), TCGA (HR = 1.51, p-value = 0.017) and KM plotter (HR = 2.67, p-value ≤ 0.0001) cohorts. Mutational landscape of LUAD showed that KEAP1 mutation was exclusively present in PILAR1 expressing samples. Further, knockdown of PILAR1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration of A549 cells. Importantly, inhibition of PILAR1 made the A549 cells more sensitive to etoposide. Furthermore, pathway analysis using differentially expressed genes in PILAR1 knockdown cells compared to control cells identified enrichment of DNA repair genes suggesting towards the mechanism of PILAR1 mediated etoposide sensitivity. Taken together, we identified a prognostically robust LncRNA, PILAR1, which also regulates cell growth in lung cancer cells. PILAR1 expression identified a novel subtype of LUAD patients with the exclusive KEAP1 mutation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Liposomes have emerged as a fascinating nanocarriers for the delivery of cancer therapeutics. However, their efficacy for cancer therapy is reduced partially because of the serum-instability and incomplete drug release. In this study, a novel disulfide cross-linked liposomes (CLs) assembled from dimeric lipoic acid-derived glycerophosphorylcholine (di-LA-PC) conjugate was developed. The conjugate was synthesized by a facial esterification of lipoic acid (LA) and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) and characterized by MS, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR. Featuring the enhanced serum-stability and intracellular drug release determined by in vitro stability and GSH-responsive behavior, CLs prepared with dried thin film technique following 10 % dithiothreitol (DTT) cross-linking can attain effective delivery of anticancer candidates. Notably, CLs stably encapsulated doxorubicin (Dox) in their vesicular structures and showed a remarkable thiol-sensitive release of payload upon cellular uptake by cancer cells, compared to that of uncross-linked liposomes (uCLs) or Doxil-like liposome (DLLs). The cell viability and apoptosis of Dox-loaded CLs worked the pronounced cytotoxic effects to MCF-7 cells with an IC 50 value of 10.8 μg Dox equiv./mL comparable to free Dox and 2.8-fold higher than DLLs. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the nanoscale characteristics of Dox-loaded CLs could prevent the proliferation of adriamycin-resistant MCF-7/ADR cell line, highlighting their potential in reversal of drug resistance. Furthermore, the preliminary in vivo test (n = 3) showed that disulfide cross-linked liposomal formulation of Dox (Dox-CLs) improved the therapeutic efficacy compared to free Dox and DLLs in a human breast carcinoma xenograft mouse model. Therefore, the current thiol-responsive cross-linked liposome may provide a robust drug delivery platform for cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "New method for the synthesis of the mononuclear anionic iron dinitrosyl complexes (DNICs) as prospective agents for nitric oxide (NO) chemotherapy of oncological diseases has been developed. Mononuclear anionic DNIC of the composition (N 2 H 5 ) + [Fe(SR) 2 (NO) 2 ] - with R = 5-nitropyridinyl (I) has been synthesized by the reaction of aqueous solutions of Na 2 [Fе(S 2 O 3 ) 2 (NO) 2 ] and N 2 H 5 [SС 5 H 3 N 2 O 2 ] salts. The latter one was synthesized by the reduction of bis-(5-nitro-pyridin-2-yl) disulfide with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol at T = 25 °C. Physical-chemical properties of the synthesized complex were studied by X-ray, SEM, IR-, EPR, Mössbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry in combination with DFT quantum-chemical calculation of molecular structure and spectroscopic properties. Complex I was found to generate NO in proton media without additional activation. The cytotoxicity of I to human tumor cells of various geneses, viz. ovarian cancer SKOV3, colon cancer LS174T and non-small cell lung cancer A549 was discovered for the first time. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Afatinib, a selective and irreversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, was approved for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression in 2013. Cetuximab (CTX), an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, is co-administered with afatinib to improve efficacy. Unfortunately, dose-related adverse reactions caused by combination therapy have affected patient compliance, and have resulted in treatment discontinuation in severe cases. In the present study, afatinib was encapsulated in “liposomes” (LPs) to achieve longer circulation in the blood and an enhanced permeability-and-retention effect in tumors. Concomitantly, CTX was designed to bind to drug-loaded LPs to form “immuno-LPs” for tumor-cell selectivity and therapeutic activity. In vitro, the cellular internalization rate of immuno-LPs was significantly higher than that of LPs (p < 0.05). In vivo, a markedly increased area under the curve and prolonged terminal half-life were detected in rats injected with the two LP formulations, indicating that LP encapsulation protected afatinib from binding to hemoglobin to control the risk of idiosyncratic drug reactions. Compared with free afatinib and LPs, immuno-LPs exhibited strongly enhanced drug delivery and antitumor efficacy in an NSCLC xenograft model, with stronger tumor selectivity and potentially fewer side-effects. Hence, EGFR-targeting immuno-LPs appear to be promising for NSCLC treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In spite of the high incidence of breast cancer worldwide, there are few strategies for its chemoprevention, and they have limited adherence mainly due to their serious adverse effects. As a new approach for local breast cancer chemoprevention, we developed and optimized microemulsions for topical delivery of celecoxib to the breast skin, and evaluated their combination with microneedles to improve drug penetration for localization in the mammary tissue. Microemulsions containing water at 15% (ME-15), 29% (ME-29) and 60% (ME-60) were obtained and characterized. They were isotropic, displayed Newtonian behavior and particle size smaller than 100 nm. ME-15 and ME-29 increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) compared to ME-60, and displayed stronger vascular toxicity, evidenced by hemorrhage and lysis in HET-CAM assays. ME-60 was more efficacious at increasing celecoxib cutaneous and percutaneous delivery (1.3–4-fold). Increasing the number of microneedle roller applications from 1 to 8 increased the number of skin punctures and TEWL; its association with ME-60 promoted no further increase in TEWL, but improved (1.6–4-fold) celecoxib cutaneous and percutaneous delivery. Microemulsion incorporation reduced celecoxib IC 50 in MCF-7 cells (3.3-fold), suggesting that presence of formulation components in the mammary tissue might improve drug cytotoxicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chemoresistance to cisplatin in lung cancer treatment remains prevalent. Since targeting excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) may be a viable strategy to reestablish the therapeutic sensitivity to platinum-based agents in chemoresistant cases, and low ERCC1 level is beneficial to metastatic lung cancer patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy, we hypothesized that metastasis-associated process is involved in ERCC1-dependent cisplatin-resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: We performed an RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in ERCC1-deficient cells co-treated with cisplatin and sodium glycididazole (CMNa). Differentially expressed genes and the hub genes in the cisplatin/CMNa-treated cells were identified by systematic network analysis. Oncomine expression analysis was also performed to evaluate the clinical implication of the identified hub gene. Results: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF/PDGFR) and focal adhesion genes were downregulated in ERCC1-defective non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells undergoing combined cisplatin/CMNa treatment. Consistent with the finding, cell migration was reduced in these cells. PDGFRB was identified as the hub gene in the process by differential expressed gene network analysis. Importantly, elevated PDGFRB level was observed in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with metastases. Conclusion: PDGF/PDGFR and focal adhesion signaling may serve as another mechanism in addition to ERCC1-mediated cisplatin-resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Multiple pro-invasion/pro-migration/proliferation and DNA damage repair pathways may be integrated to confer growth advantages on tumor cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Combination therapy is a promising treatment for certain advanced drug-resistant cancers. Although effective inhibition of various tumor cells was reported in vitro, combination treatment requires improvement in vivo due to uncontrolled ratiometric delivery. In this study, a tumor-targeting lipodisk nanoparticle formulation was developed for ratiometric loading and the transportation of two hydrophobic model drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX), in one single platform. Furthermore, a slightly acidic pH-sensitive peptide (SAPSP) incorporated into lipodisks effectively enhanced the tumor-targeting and cell internalization. The obtained co-loaded lipodisks were approximately 30 nm with a pH-sensitive property. The ratiometric co-delivery of two drugs via lipodisks was confirmed in both the drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cell line and its parental MCF-7 cell line in vitro, as well as in a tumor-bearing mouse model in vivo compared with a cocktail solution of free drugs. Co-loaded lipodisks exerted improved cytotoxicity to tumor cells in culture, particularly to drug-resistant tumor cells at synergistic drug ratios. In an in vivo xenograft mouse model, the anti-tumor ability of co-loaded lipodisks was evidenced by the remarkable inhibitory effect on tumor growth of either MCF-7 or MCF-7/ADR tumors, which may be attributed to the increased and ratiometric accumulation of both drugs in the tumor tissues. Therefore, tumor-specific lipodisks were crucial for the combination treatment of DOX and PTX to completely exert a synergistic anti-cancer effect. It is concluded that for co-loaded lipodisks, cytotoxicity data in vitro could be used to predict their inhibitory activity in vivo, potentially enhancing the clinical outcome of synergistic therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In our continued efforts to develop metal based therapeutic agents, we have synthesized a novel copper(II) complex, [{Cu(hpdbal-sbdt)} 2 ] (2) tethered with a biocompatible ONS 2− donor backbone [H 2 hpdbal-sbdt] (1) [H 2 hpdbal-sbdt is a tridentate ligand derived from S-benzyldithiocarbazate (Hsbdt) and 2-hydroxy-5-(phenyldiazenyl)benzaldehyde (Hhpdbal)]. The metal complex (2) was characterized using attenuated total reflection-infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetric (TG-DSC) analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and elemental (CHNS) analysis. The antineoplastic ability of copper complex was evaluated in vitro against human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. MTT assay results showed that the copper complex exhibited significant growth inhibition of HeLa cells with an IC 50 value of 4.46 μM and this value was compared with reported standards. Cytotoxicity of the copper complex towards human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) was also evaluated. The potentially active copper complex was studied for its solution state stability at a pH range of 3–9. Following this, the interactive behaviour of the bioactive copper complex with a drug transporter protein (BSA) was deciphered through multi-spectrosopic investigations like steady-state fluorescence, three-dimensional fluorescence, deconvoluted-IR and UV–Visible techniques. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Fisetin loaded binary ethosomes were prepared and optimized using Box-Behnken design for dermal application to alleviate skin cancer. The prepared formulations were evaluated for vesicle size, entrapment efficiency and flux of fisetin. Additionally, the optimized formulation was further evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, confocal laser microscopy, vesicles-skin interaction, dermatokinetic study and DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl) assay. The in vivo study was carried out for the evaluation of tumor incidence, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1α, lipid peroxidation values, glutathione content and catalase activity in mice. The optimized binary ethosomes formulation presented sealed unilamellar shaped vesicles, with vesicles size, entrapment efficiency and flux of 99.89 ± 3.24 nm, 89.23 ± 2.13% and 1.01 ± 0.03 µg/cm 2 /h respectively. The confocal images of rat skin clearly illustrated the deeper penetration of rhodamine B loaded binary ethosomes formulation. Further, the binary ethosomes gel treated rat skin showed substantial increase in C Skin max and AUC 0-8 in comparison to rat skin treated with conventional gel. In vivo study revealed that the mice pre-treated with fisetin binary ethosomes gel caused marked decrease in the levels of TNF-α and IL-1α as compared to the mice exposed to UV only. Further the binary ethosomes gel treated mice group had demonstrated less percentage of tumour incidences (49%) as compared to mice treated with UV only (96% tumour incidence). The novelty of the work lies in successful optimization of formulation using Box-Behnken design and characterization of binary ethosomes carrier of fisetin and demonstration of improved dermal delivery of the same. The overall data suggest that the fisetin loaded binary ethosomes formulation is a potential dermal delivery system for the management of skin cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In an attempt to develop potential and selective antitumor agents, a series of novel sulphamide tethered quinazolinone hybrids were efficiently synthesized and evaluated for antitumor activity against four cancer cell lines such as HeLa (cervical), MDA-MB-231 (breast), PANC-1 (pancreatic), and A549 (lung) in vitro. All the compounds (5a-j, 6a-g) exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity with GI 50 values ranging from 0.045 to 6.94 μM, while compound 10c showed potent activity against all the cell lines (He La, MDA-MB-231, PANC-1 and A549) with GI 50 values ranging from 0.09 to 0.21 μM. We have explored the binding mode and key active site interactions in HDAC8 and EHMT2 proteins. The docking results are complementary to the experimental results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This work presents the synthesis, structural characterization and biological affinity of the newly synthesized copper(II) complexes with the first antibacterial quinolone drug nalidixic acid (nal) or N–donor ligand 2,2′‑dipyridylamine (bipyam). [Cu(II)(nal)(bipyam)Cl], (2) reveals a distorted square pyramidal based geometry in Cu(II) atom confirmed by X-ray crystallography technique. The theoretical stabilities and optimized structures of the complex were obtained from DFT calculations. The ability of the complexes to bind with calf thymus DNA (CT DNA) were investigated by electronic absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and viscosity measurements techniques. The experimental results reveal that the complexes strongly interact with CT DNA via intercalative mode but complex 2 exhibits the highest affinity giving K b = 3.91 ± 0.13 × 10 6 , M −1 . The fluorescence spectroscopy measurements show that both complexes have the superior ability to the replacement of EtBr from DNA-bound EtBr solution and bind to DNA through intercalative mode. Both complex also shows the superior affinity towards proteins with comparatively high binding constant values which have been further revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. Molecular docking analysis indicates that the interaction of the complexes and proteins are stabilized by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. Furthermore, the results of in vitro cytotoxicity reveal that the complex 2 has excellent cytotoxicity than 1 against human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7). © 2018",

    "Abstract": "G-quadruplexes are well-known DNA secondary structures which can be formed both within the DNA and the RNA sequences of the human genome. While many functions of G-quadruplex during cell regulatory events are still unknown, a number of reports have established their role in finding new cancer therapies. In this report, we provide a detailed account of Thioflavin T (ThT) interacting with a promoter gene (c-Myc) which has relevance in several types of human cancers. Using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, we have shown that the binding of ThT is selective to c-Myc G-quadruplex only, having poor interactions with the duplex DNA sequences. UV–Visible titration experiments show that binding involves stacking interactions which were further corroborated by CD experiments. Fluorescence studies showed that the binding of ThT to c-Myc G-quadruplex results in a large increase in the fluorescence emission spectrum of c-Myc G-quadruplex while the same to duplex DNAs was much poor. Binding of ThT to c-Myc G-quadruplex results in thermal stabilization of the quadruplex DNA by up to 7.4 °C and Job plot experiments demonstrated the presence of 1:1 and 2:1 ligand to quadruplex complexes. Finally, the docking study suggested that ThT stacks with the guanine bases in one of the grooves which is in agreement with the CD studies. These results are expected to provide leads into the design of new ThT analogs and derivatives for enhancing the stability and selectivity of new G-quadruplex targeting ligands. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Triclosan, a widely used antimicrobial agent, can increase colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis, and induce liver fibrosis and cancer in mice through mechanisms which may be relevant in humans. In this study, an analytical method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS) was developed to measure dioxins and chlorinated derivatives from triclosan in the presence of active chlorine in seawater matrix. Formation yields of dioxins and chlorinated triclosans were assessed at different initial precursor concentrations under dark and UV light irradiation conditions. Results showed that triclosan was rapidly transformed to its chlorinated derivatives, i.e. tetraclosans and pentaclosans, of which the formation yields peaked after 1 h of reaction. UV light was the key factor to promote the formation of dioxins. With the same initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio, the highest yield of dioxins was observed with lower initial concentrations of triclosan under UV irradiation. Five dioxins, including 2,8-DCDD, 1,2,8-TrCDD, 2,3,7-TrCDD, 1,2,3,8-TeCDD, and 2,3,7,8-TeCDD, were identified and quantified. 2,3,7,8-TeCDD, the most toxic dioxin, was firstly reported as the photo-transformation product of triclosan in aquatic solution. Results presented here are useful for a comprehensive understanding of the fate and toxicity of triclosan in contaminated waters. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "The pyrazole derivatives, (E)-4-(2-(3-chlorophenyl)hydrazono)-5-methyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one (CPHMP) and 4-(2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)hydrazinyl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one (TCPHP) were synthesized and identified using LCMS (ESI-MS), C H N elemental and NMR analysis. Using FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra were recorded and compared with theoretically simulated spectra and found that both of them agrees with each other. The oscillator strength of CPHMP is sufficiently large which makes it an ideal candidate to use as a photo sensitizer in photo voltaic systems. First hyperpolarizabilities of CPHMP and TCPHP are 94.04 and 50.52 times that of urea. From the MEP plot the active sites are determined and C[dbnd]O group and NH moiety are the most electrophilic and nucleophilic regions for both the pyrazole derivatives. Docking studies propose that CPHMP and TCPHP might reveal negative response against human microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy is considered to be one of the alternatives to traditional chemotherapy. It's known that foreign antigen, such as ovalbumin (OVA), can label tumor cells, leading to neoantigen recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Herein, a novel multifunctional micelle coated with PEGylated hyaluronic acid (HA) was prepared through self-assembly and electrostatic interaction. The OVA-loaded micelle with uniform size (132.1 ± 0.2 nm in diameter) exhibited favorable stability and sustained release profiles. The HA-coated micelle could target CD44-overexpressed cells and enhance the cellular uptake of OVA by 11.9 fold compared to free OVA. In vitro studies revealed that the cationic polymer, polyethyleneimine, could facilitate endosomal escape of OVA to label a tumor cell. After treatment with the OVA-loaded micelle, tumor growth in mice was significantly inhibited by 70% compared to the group treated with free OVA. All these results suggest the potential application of the immunotherapeutic micellar platform for melanoma treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the present work seven new complexes of Pd(II) containing halogeno-derivatives of 7-azaindole (7AIH), [PdCl 2 (L) 2 ], where L = 3-chloro-7-azaindole (3Cl7AIH) or 3-bromo-7-azaindole (3Br7AIH) or 4-chloro-7-azaindole (4Cl7AIH) or 4-bromo-7-azaindole (4Br7AIH) or 5-bromo-7-azaindole (5Br7AIH) or 3-bromo-4-chloro-7-azaindole (3Br4Cl7AIH) or 5-bromo-3-chloro-7-azaindole (5Br3Cl7AIH) were prepared and studied by infrared and Raman spectroscopy accompanied by the DFT calculations. Full geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations were performed for the two possible isomers cis and trans of [PdCl 2 (L) 2 ] using the B3LYP method with the 6–311++G(d,p)/LanL2DZ basis sets. According to the theoretical results, the trans isomers are more stable than cis. As shown by the combined experimental and theoretical vibrational spectroscopic studies, only trans isomers with C i symmetry are present, in the solid state. The combined experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that in [PdCl 2 (L) 2 ] complexes, palladium(II) is bound to two pyridine nitrogen atoms of L ligands and to two chloride ions, in a square-planar trans arrangement. Detailed vibrational assignments of the experimental infrared and Raman spectra of these complexes have been made on the basis of the calculated potential energy distributions (PEDs). The antiproliferative activity of selected trans-[PdCl 2 (L) 2 ] have been tested against human cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF7, A549 and A2780). The obtained IC 50 values indicate that the title complexes possess lower cytotoxicity, in comparison to cisplatin. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional inference on the growth curve model (GCM) requires ‘small p large n’ (n >> p) and cannot be applied in high-dimensional scenarios, where we often encounter singularity. Several methods are proposed to tackle the singularity problem, however there are still limitations and gaps. We consider a Bayesian framework to derive a statistic for testing a linear hypothesis on the GCM. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate performance and establish optimality characteristics. We show that the test overcomes the challenge of high-dimensionality and possesses all the desirable optimality characteristics of a good test - it is unbiased, symmetric and monotone with respect to sample size and departure from the null hypotheses. The results also indicate that the test performs very well, possessing a level close to the nominal value and high power in rejecting small departures from the null. The results also show that the test overcomes limitations of a previously proposed test. We illustrated practical applications using a publicly available time course genetic data on breast cancer, where we used our test statistic for gene filtering. The genes were ranked according to the value of the test statistic and the top five genes were annotated. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were reported to be potential tumor markers for early diagnosis of cancer. Due to its short sequence, low expression level and high susceptibility to degradation, the stable and sensitive detection method of miRNAs is arduous to establish. In this work, we designed a metal chelator (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt, EDTA•2Na) labeled oligonucleotides as the plasmonic signal supraregulator probe to control the generation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Based on another complementary oligonucleotides of target miRNA labeling SiO 2 microparticles (SiO 2 MPs) as the detecting platform, EDTA•2Na labeled oligonucleotide probes were immobilized on the SiO 2 platform through the sandwich structure in the presence of target miRNA. The sandwich chelating device could further chelate Au 3+ to regulate the generation of AuNPs, resulting in colorimetric signal to qualitatively and quantitatively detect the concentration of microRNA-21 (miR-21). The results indicate that the proposed metal chelator -labeled signal amplification method has outstanding sensitivity (LOD = 8.9 fM) and excellent stability, which will be benefit for the early accurate diagnosis of miRNAs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cell-SELEX is a powerful tool to screen aptamers binding to living cellular organisms such as bacteria, fungi and even oncocytes. Here, we developed an advanced cell-SELEX strategy featuring functionalized graphene oxide (GO) and isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) to select aptamers against a prevailing foodborne pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and chitosan (CTS) were grafted onto the sheet-like GO molecules to synthesize a PC-GO material. TEM and FT-IR characterization demonstrated that the PC-GO composites were near-nanometric scale and tethered with PEG and CTS moieties, a property that significantly improved its solubility in biological buffer solutions used in cell-SELEX process. PC-GO could bind with ssDNAs with lower affinities to target cells, therefore the selection efficiency is greatly enhanced. The cell-binding aptamer candidates (CACs) were amplified by 107 fold using complementary ring mediated (CRM-RCA), a created amplification method that generate single-stranded products, which could be directly used in the next round selection. As fueled by PC-GO and CRM-RCA, four highly specific aptamers with lowest Kd value of 10.3 ± 2.5 nM were obtained. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all the four aptamers exhibited more than 75% binding affinity to V. parahaemolyticus than to other foodborne bacteria (less than 18%). Simple procedure, high efficiency, and free from expensive thermal cycler (required by PCR amplification) will enable the established strategy to find its applications in aptamer selecting against fungi, stem and cancerous cells as well. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To translate and culturally adapt the Lymphoedema Functioning, Disability and Health Questionnaire (Lymph-ICF) for breast cancer survivors with arm lymphedema into Danish and examine its content validity and reliability. Methods: (1) Translation and cultural adaptation was performed in 10 steps following international guidelines (International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research); (2) cognitive interviewing (step 7) was conducted in 15 women with breast cancer related arm lymphedema to explore understandability, interpretation, and cultural relevance; (3) after adjustments, content validity (N = 52) was explored by interviews; and (4) reliability (N = 50) examined by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) statistics and Cronbach alpha analysis. Results: Cognitive interviewing lead to an adapted and improved version of the translated questionnaire. Content validity was supported. Internal consistency (α) for all questions was.98 and ranged for the different domains between 0.92 and 0.97. Test–retest reliability for the total score was highly satisfactory, ICC = 0.95, standard error of measurement (SEM) = 4.5 and smallest detectable change = 12.5. ICC values for the domains ranged from 0.84 to 0.94. SEM values differed for the domains, 6.4 (physical function), 5.7 (mobility activities), 7.09 (life and social activities), 9.1 (mental functions), and 10.2 (household activities). Conclusion: The translated and adjusted Lymph-ICF DK (Denmark) is reliable and valid, allowing for assessing self-reported impairments in function, activity limitations, and participation restrictions in Danish patients with breast cancer-related arm lymphedema. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Growing evidence sheds light on the use of flavonoids as the promising alternatives for the treatment of chronic conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, in the present study, we aimed at evaluating the effects of oral intake of two structurally different flavonoids 5-hydroxy-6,7,4ʹ-trimethoxyflavone (flavone 1) and 5,7,4ʹ-trihydroxyflavone (flavone 2) on recognition memory, hippocampal protein level of immediate early gene cFos and mitochondrial dynamic markers in Amyloid β (Aβ)-injected rats. Recognition aspect of memory and level of proteins were measured using novel object recognition test and Western blot, respectively. Our data indicated that even though flavone 1 was more effective than flavone 2 to prevent memory impairment, feeding with both flavones alleviated memory in Aβ-injected rats. Furthermore, in flavones-administered rats, mitochondrial dynamic balancing returned to the control level by the decline in Dynamin-related protein-1 protein level, a known marker for mitochondrial fission, and elevation in protein level of mitochondrial fusion factors Mitofusins 1 and 2. In parallel with behavior results, flavone 1 was more effectual on mitochondrial dynamic moderating. The more neuroprotective effects of flavone 1 could be attributed to its methylated structure leading to crossing of the blood-brain barrier with ease and metabolic stability and bioactivity. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Measles virus (MV), a paramyxovirus, is one of the most contagious human pathogens and is responsible for thousands of deaths annually. Wild-type MV evolved to counter the innate immune system by avoiding both type I interferon (IFN) induction and inhibiting IFN signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway. However, virus replication is significantly inhibited in IFN-pretreated cells. Similarly, MV vaccine derived strains are inhibited by IFN pretreatment, but vaccine strains also induce IFN. Despite the significant progress in understanding the interactions between MV and the IFN pathway, the IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit MV replication remain largely unknown. The aim of this study is to identify specific ISGs that mediate restriction of MV. In this study, we report that Radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2) restricts MV infection at the stage of virus release in infected 293T cells. Furthermore, attenuated MV strains are currently being developed as a novel treatment for solid and hematological malignancies. Therefore, we tested the impact of RSAD2 expression in an oncolytic virotherapy context using a MV permissive ovarian cancer line (SR-B2). As measured in 293T cells, MV release was also impaired in SR-B2 cells transduced to express RSAD2 in vitro. Additionally, oncolytic MV therapeutic efficacy was impaired in SR-B2 cells transduced to express RSAD2 in vivo. Overall, we identify RSAD2 as a novel restriction factor for MV by inhibiting the release of virus. These results provide important information regarding the interaction between MV and the innate immune system, as well as implications for the design of oncolytic MV platforms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is known as a most prevalent cancer and second deadly cancer, among women worldwide. Due to the high incidence rate of breast cancer and limitations of conventional therapy it seemed essential to look for new targets in cancer cells and directly target them such as target therapy on breast cancer stem cells. In this review we indicate some of therapeutic uses of cancer stem cells in breast cancer. Some strategies are targeting surface specific markers and activated signaling pathways in their microenvironment such as Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt/b-catenin, PI3K/Akt, NF-kB, BMP and TGF-β and their maintenance and drug resistance, using various miRNAs, enhancement of CSCs apoptosis, differentiation therapy, blocking epithelial to mesenchymal transition and using different natural compounds. Recent studies have shown that cancer stem cells play major roles in target therapy on breast cancer. The new manipulation approaches of cancer stem cells can be used as target therapy of breast cancer that were highlighted for immunotherapy of cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To evaluate the association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), lung cancer incidence and cancer mortality in men. Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Maximal exercise testing was performed in 4920 men (59.2 ± 11.4 years) free from malignancy at baseline. Multivariate Cox hazard models adjusted for established cancer risk factors including smoking were analyzed for lung cancer incidence and cancer mortality among those who were diagnosed with lung cancer. Population attributable risks (PAR) of low CRF (<5 METs) were determined. Results: During 12.7 ± 7.5 years follow-up, 105 (2.1%) participants were diagnosed with lung cancer and 83 (79%) of those died from cancer after 3.6 ± 4.6 years from diagnosis. CRF was inversely and independently associated with cancer outcomes. A 1-MET increase and categories of moderate and high CRF were associated with 10%, 47% and 65% reduction in lung cancer incidence (p = 0.002), and 13%, 58% and 76% reduction in cancer mortality (p = 0.002), respectively. Also, individuals who were diagnosed with lung cancer and were at moderate or high CRF categories at baseline exhibited longer survival time (p < 0.001). The PARs% for lung cancer incidence and cancer mortality were 8.7% and 18.5%, respectively. Conclusions: Higher CRF is associated with lower lung cancer incidence in men. Among individuals who were diagnosed with lung cancer, higher CRF was associated with reduced cancer mortality and longer survival time. These results support the protective benefits of higher CRF in the prevention of lung cancer outcomes. Eliminating low CRF as a risk factor would potentially prevent considerable lung cancer morbidity and mortality. © 2018 Sports Medicine Australia",

    "Abstract": "Background: The incidence of cancer has steadily risen. It is important to identify modifiable predictors in early life that may decrease cancer risks and mortality. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between aerobic fitness in adolescence and the subsequent risk of cancer and cancer-associated mortality. Methods: The study included 1 185 439 Swedish men born between 1950 and 1980 that participated in the military conscription (mean age = 18 years). The results from the aerobic fitness test (W max ) was linked to the risk of cancer and cancer-associated mortality during a 40-years’ follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models. A co-sibling design was employed to take familial factors into account. Results: During a mean follow-up of 27 years 15 093 cases of cancer and 4900 cancer-associated mortalities were registered. Higher W max (per additional 1 SD) was associated with a decreased risk of cancer at 40 years of follow-up (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.91–0.96 for cancer and HR 0.82 95% CI 0.76–0.87 for cancer-associated mortality) but not at 5 years of follow-up (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.99–1.07; and HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97–1.12). In the co-sibling model the protective effects of high W max were increased at 40 years of follow-up for cancer (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85–0.98) and cancer-associated mortality (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68–0.89). Conclusions: These findings identify in late adolescence a potentially modifiable predictor of cancer, with higher aerobic fitness associated with a decreased risk of cancer incidence and mortality later in life. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A) is been suggested to accelerate tumor cell migration and invasion in breast cancer, cervical cancer, Ewing sarcoma and neuroblastoma. The role of KDM3A in colorectal cancer progression and metastasis remains unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the clinical significance and biological function of KDM3A in colorectal cancer. In our results, we found KDM3A expression was significantly increased in colorectal cancer metastatic lesions compared with primary lesions, but had no statistical difference between colorectal cancer tissues and normal colorectal tissues. Moreover, high KDM3A expression was correlated with poor histological differentiation, and advanced clinical stage, N classification, M classification and short overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses indicated that high expression of KDM3A served as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients. The loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies showed KDM3A functioned as oncogene to regulate colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion through modulating EMT and MMPs. In conclusion, KDM3A is a promising therapeutic target for preventing metastasis and improving prognosis in colorectal cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Incidence data from the population cancer registry of Cotonou (Benin) for the three year period 2014–2016 are presented. 1086 cancer cases were recorded, 608 cases (56.0%) in women (corresponding to an age standardized incidence rate (ASR) of 78.4 per 100,000) and 478 cases (44.0%) in men (ASR 91.8 per 100,000). Breast and cervical cancer accounted for 49.2% of all cancers in women. Breast cancer (ASR 22.6 per 100,000) was more common than cervical cancer (ASR 14.9 per 100,000) and the mean age of cases was lower. The incidence of prostate cancer (one quarter of all cancers in men), 30.5 per 100,000, was similar to that in other West African registries. Cancers of the liver and digestive tract were also relatively common in both sexes. These are the first data on cancer incidence in Benin, and will be invaluable for the development and evaluation of the National Cancer Control plan. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To further quantify the association between physical activity (PA) after breast cancer diagnosis and all-cause mortality, breast cancer mortality and/or breast cancer recurrence. Methods and results: PubMed was searched until November 2017 for observational studies investigating any type of PA in association with total mortality, breast cancer mortality and/or breast cancer recurrence among women with breast cancer diagnosis. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects models for highest versus lowest categories of PA. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. During an average follow-up ranging from 3.5 to 12.7 years there were 23,041 breast cancer survivors, 2,522 deaths from all causes, 841 deaths from breast cancer and 1,398 recurrences/remissions. Compared to women in the lowest recreational PA level (lowest quintile/quartile), women in the highest level had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.58, 95% CIs: 0.45–0.75; 8 studies), of death from breast cancer (HR = 0.60, 95% CIs 0.36–0.99; 5 studies) and a lower, albeit non-significant, risk of recurrence (HR = 0.79, 95% CIs 0.60–1.05; 5 studies). There was evidence of heterogeneity between the studies evaluating recreational PA and total mortality (Ι 2 = 52.4%) and even higher for breast cancer mortality (Ι 2 = 77.7%) or recurrence (Ι 2 = 66.4%). Conclusion: Highest recreational PA after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with lower all-cause and breast cancer mortality. This finding probably reflects the favorable impact of PA on cardiovascular mortality, and a possible favorable role on breast cancer survival, though reverse causation cannot be excluded. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although the cancer mortality rate in Taiwan has been declining in recent years, no study has yet reported any regional differences in cancer mortality rates in Taiwan. We hypothesized that regional cancer mortality rates in Taiwan, an ethnically homogeneous society, exhibited no significant variations. Methods: We investigated the trends in Taiwan regional cancer mortality between 1992 and 2014. We analyzed regional age-standardized cancer mortality rates for lung, liver, colon, stomach, oral, breast, and prostate cancers using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database and Demographic Database. Furthermore, we applied Joinpoint regression analysis to evaluate the trends across different regions. Results: There are clear regional variations in mortality rates for liver, stomach, and oral cancers, but not for lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancers. The regional death rates of oral cancer, especially for eastern Taiwan, not only elevate the fastest (APC = 14.78% per year, P < 0.001) but also show the largest disparities between men and women. Regional death rates for stomach cancer, which declined most rapidly, are converging in both general and gender groups. Liver cancer is the only one with regional variations whose trends do not all go in the same direction. We also demonstrated that northern Taiwan has significant regional advantages with respect to cancer mortality. Conclusions: Some but not all cancers in Taiwan show regional disparities. Liver, stomach, and oral cancers in Taiwan exhibit clear regional variations in mortality rates. In particular, the regional variations in oral cancer mortality rates are consistent with those in alcohol consumption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Fatigue is one of the most prevalent adverse events reported by cancer patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between traditional Chinese medicine body constitution (TCMBC) and moderate-to-severe cancer-related fatigue in cancer patients. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on cancer patients recruited from a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. The association between TCMBC, measured using the Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) and moderate-to-severe cancer-related fatigue (based on the Taiwanese version of the Brief Fatigue Inventory score ≥ 4) was evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 170 participants, 37 (21.8%) had moderate-to-severe fatigue. Yang-deficiency (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50–8.40) and Qi-deficiency (aOR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.18–6.82) TCMBC were significantly associated with moderate-to-severe cancer-related fatigue. Conclusion: TCMBC could be used as a clinical tool to identify cancer patients prone to experience moderate-to-severe cancer-related fatigue, and to provide Chinese medicine practitioners a basis for selecting an appropriate treatment approach based on TCMBC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "PRSS23 is a newly discovered serine protease that has been associated with tumor progression in various types of cancers. Our previous study showed PRSS23 is down-regulated obviously in Hedgehog pathway blocked gastric cancer cells. However, the correlation between PRSS23 and tumor progression of gastric cancer remains unclear. Here, the role and mechanism of PRSS23 in tumor progression of gastric cancer were determined. PRSS23 protein levels were significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with the paired adjacent normal gastric mucosa tissues. The high expression of PRSS23 correlated strongly with both poor differentiated histology and cancer region of sinus ventriculi. Gastric cancer patients with low PRSS23 expression displayed a better prognosis. In gastric cancer cells, PRSS23 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. In xenograft tumor model, PRSS23 knockdown led to dramatic decreases of the average tumor volume and the average tumor weight. In addition, PRSS23 knockdown suppressed gastric cancer growth through inhibiting EIF2 signaling using gene expression microarray analysis. Taken together, our results suggest PRSS23 is highly associated with human gastric tumorigenesis and progression. PRSS23 knockdown could suppress tumor growth of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo through inhibiting EIF2 signaling, and EIF4E maybe a potential target of PRSS23. PRSS23 could serve as a potential target for gastric cancer therapy, and also a biomarker for the prediction of prognosis of gastric cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) has been suggested to be overexpressed, and function as an oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in various types of human malignancies. However, the expression status and function of SNHG15 were still unknown in thyroid cancer. In our study, we assessed the expression status and clinical value in thyroid cancer samples, and explored the effect of SNHG15 on thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In results, SNHG15 expression was downregulated in thyroid cancer tissues and cells, and correlated with age, pathology classification, clinical stage, tumor size, distant metastasis, and disease-free survival. The in vitro studies suggested SNHG15 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in thyroid cancer. In summary, SNHG15 serves as tumor suppressive role in thyroid cancer. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Currently, studies have shown that microRNA-93 (miR-93) can be an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in different kinds of cancers. The role of miR-93 in human cancers is inconsistent and the underlying mechanism on the aberrant expression of miR-93 is complicated. Methods: We first conducted gene enrichment analysis to give insight into the prospective mechanism of miR-93. Second, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical value of miR-93. Finally, a validation test based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to further investigate the role of miR-93 in pan-cancer. Results: Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis results showed that the target genes of miR-93 were closely related to transcription, and MAPK1, RBBP7 and Smad7 became the hub genes. In the diagnostic meta-analysis, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were 0.76 (0.64-0.85), 0.82 (0.64-0.92), and 0.85 (0.82-0.88), respectively, which suggested that miR-93 had excellent performance on the diagnosis for human cancers. In the prognostic meta-analysis, dysregulated miR-93 was found to be associated with poor OS in cancer patients. In the qPCR validation test, the serum levels of miR-93 were upregulated in breast cancer, breast hyperplasia, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, nasopharyngeal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, gastric ulcer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and prostate cancer compared with healthy controls. Conclusions: miR-93 could act as an effective diagnostic and prognostic factor for cancer patients. Its clinical value for cancer early diagnosis and survival prediction is promising. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aging is the single most significant risk factor for cancer development. However, the potential impact of aging on cancer microenvironment remains poorly understood. Here, we performed a pan-cancer transcriptome analysis to identify aging-specific molecular patterns across 18 cancer types. Strikingly, aging-specific molecular features define human cancers into two types, including the strong and weak aging-effect groups. Significant aging associated molecular signature was observed in 16 cancer types (strong aging-effect group) such as breast invasive carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. In such 16 cancer types, old patients showed obvious poor survival compared to young patients, but this observation was not found in the weak aging-effect cancers. Aging-associated cancer-relevant molecules significantly enriched in 23 pathways including EMT and KRAS signaling. More interestingly, in cancer microenvironment, aging significantly restrains adaptive immunity, but strikingly, increases the number of infiltrated innate immune cells. Further analysis shows that the expression of immune checkpoints including PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and CTLA-4 are mostly correlated with age. In general, cancer cells in elderly patients show a more aggressive phenotype and their surrounding microenvironment is under a more immune suppression status compared to young patients. Our study provides a systematic understanding of aging-associated molecular features in pan-cancer and indicates a clinical requirement to develop aging-specific therapeutic strategies in a majority of cancer types. Furthermore, aging-altered immune cells and immune checkpoints should be considered in cancer immunotherapy. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Current therapy of advanced cancers is based on several modalities including radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecularly targeted inhibitors and antibodies targeting immune checkpoints. All of those these modalities can negatively impact the cardiovascular system, and there is considerable experience in relation to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In contrast, the knowledge base on cardiovascular toxicities of novel agents targeting signal transduction pathways and immune regulation is quite limited. In particular, potential late effects are of concern as cardiovascular pathology can negatively impact quality of life and prognosis in cancer survivors, particularly when additional cardiovascular risk factors are present. Treatment-associated adverse events include hypertension, venous thromboembolism, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, heart failure and arrhythmias. Early diagnosis of subclinical cardiotoxic effects of cancer therapies remains challenging. Integrated care, as provided by multidisciplinary cardio-oncology teams is the best option for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with cancer therapy. This review considers the cardiotoxic effects of specific cancer therapies and discusses novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches as a reference for optimizing the care of cancer patients receiving novel cancer therapies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Consistent epidemiologic and experimental studies have demonstrated that UV-emitting tanning devices cause melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The purpose of this study was to estimate the relative risk of skin cancer associated with the use of indoor tanning devices relevant to Canada, to estimate the proportion and number of skin cancers in Canada in 2015 that were attributable to indoor tanning, and to explore differences by age and sex. Methods: Skin cancer cases attributable to the use of an indoor tanning devices were estimated using Levin's population attributable risk (PAR) formula. Relative risks for skin cancer subtypes that were relevant to Canada were estimated through meta-analyses and prevalence of indoor tanning was estimated from the 2006 National Sun Survey. Age- and sex-specific melanoma data for 2015 were obtained from the Canadian Cancer Registry, while estimated NMSC incidence data were obtained from the 2015 Canadian Cancer Statistics report. Results: Ever use of indoor tanning devices was associated with relative risks of 1.38 (95% CI 1.22–1.58) for melanoma, 1.39 (1.10–1.76) for basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and 1.49 (1.23–1.80) for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Overall, 7.0% of melanomas, 5.2% of BCCs, and 7.5% of SCCs in 2015 were attributable to ever of indoor tanning devices. PARs were higher for women and decreased with age. Conclusion: Indoor tanning contributes to a considerable burden of skin cancer in Canada. Strategies aimed at reducing use should be increased and a total ban or restrictions on use and UV-intensity should be considered by health regulators. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lifestyle risk factors (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity) have been associated with increased risk of at least 20 types of cancer. We estimated the proportion of cancer cases and deaths that could be potentially avoided by eliminating or reducing lifestyle risk factors in Brazil. Methods: We obtained the distribution of lifestyle risk factors by sex and age groups from recent representative health surveys in Brazil; relative risks from pooled analyses of prospective studies and meta-analyses; and cancer cases and deaths in 2012 from GLOBOCAN. Results: We found that 26.5% (114,497 cases) of all cancer cases and 33.6% (63,371 deaths) of all cancer deaths could be potentially avoided by eliminating lifestyle risk factors in Brazil. Plausible reductions in these exposures based on policy targets and cancer prevention recommendations could have potentially avoided 4.5% (19,731 cases) and 6.1% (11,480 deaths) of all cancer cases and deaths, respectively. Tobacco smoking accounted for most of the preventable cancer cases and deaths, followed by high body mass index and alcohol consumption. Larynx, lung, oropharynx, esophagus and colorectum cancer cases and deaths could be at least halved by eliminating these lifestyle risk factors. Conclusion: Findings from this study may be useful to inform strategies for cancer prevention and control across Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The major obstacle in current cancer therapy is the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for therapeutic resistance and contribute to metastasis and recurrence. Identification of reliable biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic targets is necessary for drug development and cancer treatment. In this study, we identified that the antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CPZ) exhibited potent anti-breast cancer and anti-CSC capabilities. Treatment with CPZ suppressed stemness properties including mammosphere formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, and stemness-related gene expressions in breast cancer cells and CSCs. Moreover, CPZ increased the susceptibility of breast cancer MCF7 cells and drug-resistant MCF7/ADR cells when combined with chemotherapies. Mechanistically, we identified that CPZ suppressed yes-associated protein (YAP) through modulating Hippo signaling and promoting proteasomal degradation of YAP. Elevated expression of YAP was confirmed to be crucial for stemness-related gene expressions, and was associated with invasiveness and stem-like signatures in breast cancer patients. Moreover, overexpression of YAP conferred poor outcomes particularly of basal-like breast cancer patients. Our data showed that YAP is a promising therapeutic target for breast CSCs, and CPZ has the potential to be a repurposed drug for breast cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, as demonstrated by its 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. The poor response of pancreatic cancer to conventional therapeutics, especially against cancer stem cells (CSCs), is the primary obstacle to improving patient survival. Emerging evidence indicates that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-567G11.1 is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and that its expression is associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which RP11-567G11.1 influences survival in pancreatic cancer. Methods: We evaluated the expression of RP11-567G11.1 in pancreatic cancer tissues via in situ hybridization. We also constructed RP11-567G11.1 knockdown cell models and used CCK8 and flow cytometry to detect the function of this lncRNA. Western blotting and qPCR were used to detect the expression levels of factors related to RP11-567G11.1. Results: The results illustrated that RP11-567G11.1 was significantly up-regulated in poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer tissues as compared to its expression in non-tumor tissues. Additionally, depletion of RP11-567G11.1 in pancreatic cancer cells inhibited proliferation and cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis, suppressed the stem cell-like phenotype, and increased sensitivity to gemcitabine. Also depletion of RP11-567G11.1 in pancreatic cancer cells inhibited factors downstream of the NOTCH signaling pathway. Conclusion: RP11-567G11.1 plays a crucial role in pancreatic cancer. Importantly, depletion of RP11-567G11.1 boosts the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine, suggesting that this lncRNA is a promising target for pancreatic cancer treatment. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to be crucial constituents of cancer microenvironment (CME) and play an important role in initiation, progression and metastasis of various types of cancer, such as oral cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer. CAFs are usually derived from normal fibroblasts (NFs), but the mechanism of the transition in gastric cancer has not yet been fully elucidated. Methods: qRT-PCR and western blot were employed to investigate differences of miR-141 and STAT4 expression respectively. The CAF-like features and wnt/β-catenin pathway related proteins in NF or BMSC were assessed by qRT-PCR or western blot after treated with the conditioned medium from different indicated groups of gastric cancer cells. The invasion and migration ability of AGS cells after transfection were analyzed by Transwell assay and wound healing assay. Dual-luciferase report assay was employed to determine the direct binding of miR-141 to STAT4 3’ UTR. Results: For the first time, the present study found that STAT4 over-expression in gastric cancer cells induced NFs to obtain CAF-like features via activating wnt/β-catenin pathway. Further gain-of-function and loss-of-function analysis revealed that miR-141 not only limited the migration and invasion of the gastric cancer cells, but also inhibited the transition of NFs and BMSC to CAFs. The luciferase assay indicated that miR-141 directly targeted the 3’-UTR predictive sequence of STAT4. Conclusion: Our data showed that miR-141 inhibited migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells and inhibited transition from NFs to CAFs via targeting STAT4/wnt/β-catenin pathway. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Breast cancer survivors report significant cognitive impairments post treatment, particularly following chemotherapy. Depression may also occur post treatment and may partially mediate the effects of cancer treatment on cognition. Additionally, physical activity has been shown to mitigate treatment effects on cognition and depression. This study examined the role of depression in mediating the effects of cancer treatment on cognitive function (perceived cognitive impairment, PCI; perceived cognitive ability, PCA) in breast cancer survivors and explored the role of physical activity in moderating these effects. Materials and methods: 317 breast cancer survivors were recruited via Army of Women. Participants were 40–75 years old and had stage 0 (in situ) to IIIc breast cancer and were less than 10 years post treatment. Participants completed a demographic and treatment questionnaire, as well as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: Depressive symptoms significantly contributed to cognitive function in all models. Moderate and vigorous levels of physical activity moderated breast cancer treatment effects on depression and cognition. Chemotherapy, tamoxifen, and anastrozole all demonstrated negative effects on cognition. Conclusion: The results from this study support the importance of examining mediating factors in the effects of cancer treatment on cognition, particularly depression, following cancer treatment. Effects of treatment on cognition in breast cancer survivors are partially explained by changes in depressive symptoms, although chemotherapy may impact cognition independent of depression. Importantly, physical activity may reduce the risk of depression and cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) disease have similar symptoms, which makes them difficult to distinguish clinically and leads to the danger of NTM disease being neglected. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of developing mycobacterial disease among cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a population-based database. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was adjusted to identify independent factors contributing to the development of mycobacterial disease in the cancer cohort. Results: The results showed that the increased risk of developing TB and NTM disease was 1.84-fold and 4.43-fold, respectively, in cancer patients compared with the general population. Advanced age (≥65years) and being male were risk factors for developing TB disease. There was a 4.09-fold significantly increased risk of TB disease within six months of a cancer diagnosis. Hematological cancer patients were most likely to develop mycobacterial disease. Younger hematological cancer patients (< 45years) had a higher risk of NTM disease development. Conclusion: There is an increasing risk of mycobacterial disease in cancer patients. We suggest that the possibility of mycobacterial disease in cancer patients should be assessed during the period of cancer therapy, particularly in those who have risk factors. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the interleukin-6 cytokine family, plays a complex role in cancer. LIF inhibits the proliferation and survival of several myeloid leukemia cells but promotes tumor progression and metastasis in many solid tumors. However, the relationship between LIF and gastric cancer has not been well understood. LIF was downregulated in gastric cancer as detected by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Notably, LIF was downregulated in approximately 70% (56/80) of primary gastric cancers, in which it was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival (median 5-year survival = 26 vs. 43 months for patients with high LIF expression and low LIF expression gastric cancer, respectively). To study the potential function of LIF in the downregulation of gastric cancer, we monitored the behavior using proliferation, cell cycle, and flow cytometry analysis. Overexpression of LIF inhibited the gastric cancer cell cycle in the G1 phase. In our experiment, overexpression of LIF by lentivirus upregulated P21 and downregulated cyclin D1. Recombinant human LIF also downregulated P21 and cyclin D1 at various times. A further in vivo tumor formation study in nude mice indicated that overexpression of LIF in gastric cancer significantly delayed the progress of tumor formation. These findings indicate that LIF may serve as a negative regulator of gastric cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This research aimed to assess the radiation absorbed dose produced by 177 Lu-iPSMA ( 177 Lu-prostate specific membrane antigen inhibitor), 225 Ac-iPSMA and 223 RaCl 2 to prostate cancer cell nuclei in a simplified model of bone by using an experimental in-vitro prostate cancer LNCaP cell biokinetic study and Monte Carlo simulation with the MCNPX code. Results showed that 225 Ac-iPSMA releases a nine hundred-fold radiation dose greater than 177 Lu-iPSMA and 14 times more than 223 RaCl 2 per unit of activity retained in bone. 225 Ac-iPSMA could be the best option for treatment of bone metastases in prostate cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aims to investigate the association between distance to health services and intervals in the cancer diagnostic pathway, and explore whether the diagnostic difficulty of the cancer influences this association. Method: A nationwide cohort study was conducted based on data from both questionnaires and registries. Danish cancer patients diagnosed in 2005–2016 and their general practitioner (GP) were included if enrolled in the Danish Cancer in Primary Care (CaP) cohort (n = 37,872). The CaP cohorts provided data on intervals assessed by patients and GPs. The Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to calculate travel distances from the residence of the patient to their GP surgery and to the hospital of diagnosis. Results: Longer travel distance to the hospital of diagnosis was associated with longer diagnostic interval. This association was strongest in the period before the implementation of Cancer Patient Pathways (CPP) in 2010. Patients with a cancer categorised as ´hard to diagnose´ contributed mostly to the association. Longer travel distance to the GP was associated with shorter patient interval and primary care interval for patients diagnosed with cancer types ´intermediate to diagnose´. Conclusion: Travel distance to cancer diagnostic health care services was associated with interval length in the diagnostic pathway. This association was less pronounced in the period after introducing CPPs and also strongly depending of the underlying cancer type and symptomatology. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The population of breast cancer survivors is growing. In Western societies, many of these women are working age, and therefore, potentially desire to return to the work force. We aimed to evaluate the unemployment risk for up to 8 years following a breast cancer diagnosis and identify contributing socio-economic factors. Methods: This historical prospective study included baseline measurements from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics 1995 National Census, with follow-up to 2011. We retrieved data on employment from the Israeli Tax Authority database and cancer status from the National Cancer Registry. A control group without cancer was selected to match the patients. Analyses were controlled for socio-economic factors and the baseline employment status 2 years prior to diagnosis. Results: We retrieved data for 2341 patients with breast cancer and 6837 age-matched women without cancer. We found an elevated risk of unemployment during the 8 years after breast cancer diagnosis (2-year OR 1.82, 95%CI: 1.59–2.075; 8-year OR 1.26, 95%CI: 1.07–1.47). Age and all examined socio-economic variables were correlated to increased risk of unemployment. The strongest predictor was pre-diagnosis unemployment (2-year OR 18.95, 95%CI: 16.68–21.52; 8-year OR 4.92, 95%CI: 4.07–5.96). Surprisingly, patients with axillary involvement were associated with less risk of unemployment than other patients. Conclusions: Breast cancer survivorship was associated with long-term risk of unemployment. Older patients and patients with lower socio-economic status were at increased risk of unemployment. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "As a first line medicine for malaria treatment, artesunate (ART) also shows antitumor potential. However, little is known about the effect of ART on the cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we found that ART inhibited cell growth in SK-HEP1 and SM7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. A microarray was used to identify differentially expressed protein-coding RNAs (pcRNA) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) between SK-HEP1 cells with and without ART treatment. A differentially expressed lncRNA—RP11, the most related to the EMT of liver cancer cells—RP11 was identified by abioinformatics method Overexpressing and silencing assays were used to verify the role of RP11 in cancer cell EMT. The levels of RP11- and EMT-related genes in liver cancer samples from 75 patients were detected by using qualitative polymerase chain reaction or immunohistochemistry. We identified 1334 pcRNAs and 1670 lncRNA with differential expression induced by ART. ART inhibits EMT, proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion of liver cancer cells. RP11 depresses the inhibitory effect of ART on cancer cell EMT. The level of RP11 is associated with cancer cell EMT and metastasis and survival rate of the patient. These data suggest that RP11-linking ART and cancer cell EMT are important for ART-inhibited metastasis of liver cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Diagnosis and treatment of gynecologic cancers can have a negative impact on sexuality. Identification of sexual problems and concerns is key to enable appropriate management. Therefore, there is a need for a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating the sexuality of patients. This study aimed to adapt the sexuality scale for women with gynecologic cancer for Turkish patients with gynecologic cancer. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 150 volunteer patients with gynecologic cancer was undertaken in Turkey. The patients completed a semi-structured demographic data form and the sexuality scale for women with gynecologic cancer. We assessed the reliability, language accuracy, and content and construct validities of the Turkish version of the scale. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the scale had four factors. In the exploratory factor analysis, seven items were discarded from the scale because their load values were <0.3. In the confirmatory factor analysis, the coefficients were higher than 0.3. The total Cronbach's α was 0.72. Conclusions: The sexuality scale for women with gynecologic cancer (Turkish version) is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating the sexuality of Turkish patients with gynecologic cancer. © 2018 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co.

    "Abstract": "The immune system plays a dual role of host-protecting and tumor-promoting, as elegantly expressed by the ‘cancer immunoediting’ hypothesis. Although breast cancer has not been traditionally considered to be immunogenic, recently there is accumulating and solid evidence on the association between immune system and breast cancer. To mount an effective anti-tumor response, host immunosurveillance must recognize tumor-specific epitopes, thus defining the antigenicity of a tumor. Neoantigens are mutant cancer peptides that arise as terminal products of the expression of somatic cancer mutations. Neoantigens and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins present together to effector cells of the immune system. Neoantigen vaccines have shown promising results in inducing neoantigen-specific T-cell responses. Currently, cancer vaccines are under evaluation in breast cancer to avoid recurrences in patients at high risk despite optimal standard therapy. Given the promise of a very specific long-term antitumor immune response, the development of cancer vaccines continues is of great interest. Combinations of neoantigen vaccines and other immunotherapies are also studied to evade cancer immune escape. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Dietary polyphenols are known to exert health benefits through modulation of signaling networks. This study investigated the modulation of micro-RNAs associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-axis by mango polyphenols (MP) in MCF-12A non-cancer and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell lines. MP reduced proliferation in the cancer cells by up to 90% (10 mg GAE/L) but did not cause cytotoxicity in the non-cancer cells within the same concentration range. In contrast, in TNF-α-treated non-cancer MCF-12A cells, MP significantly decreased expression and phosphorylation of NF-κB while modulating mRNA and protein levels of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and up-regulated miR-126. The mechanistic involvement of miR-126 was investigated using its antagomiR. In MDA-MB231 cells, miR-126 was not affected. However, polyphenols modulated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-axis and down-regulated miR-21 while the expressions of NF-κB and biomarkers for inhibition of apoptosis, namely, PARP-1 and Bcl-2 decreased. Overall, MP reduced inflammation in non-cancer and proliferation in breast cancer cells by differentially modulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR and associated micro-RNAs. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of miR-145-5p and its tumor-suppressive effect in breast cancer patients. Methods: We used luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot to identify sex-determining region Y-box2 (SOX2) as the target gene of miR-145-5p. Their expression levels in breast cancer tissues (n = 122) were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We also applied 3-(4,5-dimethyl- 2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometry to reveal the effect of miR-145-5p on proliferation in breast cancer. Results: miR-145-5p expression is downregulated in breast cancer tissues and negatively correlated with SOX2 expression. Decreased miR-145-5p expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, distal metastasis, higher Ki67 expression level, and shorter overall survival. miR-145-5p inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation via targeting SOX2, and multivariate regression showed that both miR-145-5p and SOX2 were unfavorable prognostic factors. Conclusions: miR-145-5p played a suppressive role in the proliferation of breast cancer cells by targeting SOX2, and miR-145-5p is a putative biomarker for risk assessment in patients with breast cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Recent research suggests that the first-line oral antidiabetes drug metformin may prevent gastric cancer progression and improve prognosis. Many studies have also shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether lncRNAs participate in the mechanisms by which metformin affects gastric cancer cells. In the current study, we found that metformin significantly inhibited the cellular functions of gastric cancer cells through Cell Counting Kit-8 and invasion assays. We found that lncRNA H19 was greatly downregulated in gastric cancer cells treated with metformin using lncRNA microassays. Based on bioinformatics analyses of the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases, H19 is shown to be overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues, with increased expression of H19 relating to advanced pathological tumor stage and pathological tumor node metastasis stage, indicating that H19 may be associated with the invasive ability of gastric cancer. We knocked down H19 in AGS and SGC7901 cell lines and found that knocked-down H19 could decrease gastric cancer cell invasion and that metformin could not further decrease invasion after the knock down. Moreover, H19 depletion increased AMPK activation and decreased MMP9 expression, and metformin could not further activate AMPK or decrease MMP9 in H19 knocked-down gastric cancer cells. In summary, metformin has a profound antitumor effect on gastric cancer cells, and H19 is a key component in the process of metformin suppressing gastric cancer cell invasion. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer remains the most common female malignancy and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Oldenlandia diffusa has been empirically and extensively used as an adjuvant therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with proven efficacy. However, its anti-metastasis mechanism has been poorly revealed. Methods: Multiple molecular biology experiments as well as network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis were conducted to investigate the anti-metastasis mechanism of Oldenlandia diffusa in breast cancer. Results: We demonstrated that ethanol extract of Oldenlandia diffusa (EEOD) significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of high-metastatic breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453, while having no obvious cytotoxic effect on multiple nonmalignant cells. Furthermore, EEOD remarkably suppressed the migration and invasion capacities of the above breast cancer cells by modulating the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. More importantly, EEOD also significantly inhibited breast cancer metastasis in zebrafish xenotransplantation model in vivo. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis further demonstrated that EEOD yielded 12 candidate compounds and 225 potential targets, and shared 85 putative targets associated with breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing and experimental validation results suggested that EEOD might inhibit breast cancer metastasis by attenuating the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as overexpression of Cav-1 could weaken the anti-metastasis efficacy of EEOD. Conclusions: Overall, our findings proved that EEOD could inhibit breast cancer metastasis by attenuating the expression of Cav-1, highlighting the use of EEOD as an adjunctive therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients. This study also provides novel insights into network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis as effective tools to illuminate the scientific basis of TCM. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Increasing evidence(s) suggests that cancer stem cells (CSC) in tumours contribute to radio-resistance and recurrence. Notch plays an important role in the maintenance of CSC in many cancers including cervical cancer. Previously, we have reported the role of Fused Toes Homolog (FTS) in conferring radioresistance in cervical cancer cells in vitro and human subjects. The present study investigated the regulatory role of FTS in Notch signaling and maintenance of CSC upon irradiation of cervical cancer cells. The expression of Notch1, 2, 3, cleaved Notch1 and its downstream target Hes1, and spheroid formation was increased by irradiation. Silencing of FTS prevented the radiation-induced increase in the expression of Notch signaling molecules and spheroid formation. Immunoprecipitation showed FTS binds Notch1 and Hes1. Also in silico structural analysis identified putative residues responsible for the binding between FTS and Notch1. Spheroid formation and the expression of CSC markers, Nanog, Oct4A and Sox2 were greatly reduced by combining silencing of FTS and radiation. Taken together, these results suggest that FTS is involved in the regulation of irradiation-induced Notch signaling and CSC activation and can be used as a target to increase radiosensitivity in cervical cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in several human cancer types. However, little is known regarding its involvement and potential mechanism in human breast cancer. In this study, we explored the effect of MEG3 on the growth of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro and in vivo, and sought to elucidate the potential signaling mechanisms. Ectopic overexpression of MEG3 using a lentiviral vector Lv-MEG3 significantly inhibited breast cancer cell growth in vitro and a cancer xenograft growth in vivo. MEG3 overexpression led to marked increase of apoptosis in breast cancer cells as determined using flow cytometry and fragmented DNA labeling. Moreover, ectopic expression of MEG3 increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–related proteins required for unfolded protein response, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6), as well as proapoptotic proteins CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-3. Finally, MEG3 overexpression markedly increased nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) expression, NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, and p53 expression, whereas pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB completely abolished MEG3-induced activation of p53. Together, these results suggest that MEG3 inhibits breast cancer growth and induces breast cancer apoptosis, partially via the activation of the ER stress, NF-κB and p53 pathways, and that NF-κB signaling is required for MEG3-induced p53 activation in breast cancer cells. Our results indicate targeting lncRNA MEG3 may represent a novel strategy for breast cancer therapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we aimed to explore the association between miR-99a-5p and CDC25A in breast cancer and the regulatory mechanisms of miR-99a-5p on breast cancer. The expressions of messenger RNA and microRNAs in breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were analyzed by the Cancer Genome Atlas microarray analysis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted to find out the expression levels of miR-99a-5p and CDC25A. The expression levels of proteins (CDC25A, ki67, cyclin D1, p21, BAX, BCL-2, BCL-XL, MMP2, and MMP9) were determined by Western blot analysis. The relationship between miR-99a-5p and CDC25A was predicted and verified by bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase assay. After transfection, cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of breast cancer tissues were, respectively, observed by cell counting kit-8 assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry (FCM). Furthermore, the relationship among miR-99a-5p, CDC25A, and cell-cycle progression was determined by FCM assay. The nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment was performed to verify the influence of miR-99a-5p on breast cancer cell in vivo. The expression of miR-99a-5p in breast cancer tissues and cells was significantly downregulated, whereas CDC25A expression was upregulated. MiR-99a-5p targeted CDC25A and suppressed its expression in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-99a-5p and decreased expression of CDC25A could suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion and facilitate apoptosis. Cell-cycle progression was significantly activated by downregulated miR-99a-5p and upregulated CDC25A. Moreover, miR-99a-5p overexpression repressed the expressions of CDC25A, marker ki67, and Cyclin D1 proteins, whereas it upregulated the expression of p21 protein.

    "Abstract": "Participation in screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) may be affected by general beliefs about cancer and about CRC screening. The aim of this population-based study was to examine prospectively the association between beliefs about cancer and CRC screening and later participation in screening for CRC. We included 1285 individuals who had answered ‘the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer (ABC) measure’ in 2011 and who had been invited to CRC screening in 2014–2016. The ABC measure includes statements about six general beliefs about cancer and three beliefs about CRC screening. These data were combined with register-based information on CRC screening behaviour, which was obtained from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Screening Database. Multivariate analyses showed that individuals who tended to agree that they would worry about what might be found in the CRC screening (PR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.24–2.23) and individuals who strongly agreed that screening is only necessary if symptoms are present (PR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.05–1.75) were more likely to be non-participants than individuals who strongly disagreed with these beliefs. Included individuals were also more likely to be non-participants if they strongly agreed that they did not want to know about cancer (PR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.09–2.07), whereas those who strongly agreed that screening could reduce their risk of dying from CRC were less likely to be non-participants (PR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49–0.97). This study shows that beliefs about CRC screening and, to a lesser extent, general beliefs about cancer are associated with participation in screening for CRC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer has an overexpression of galectin-3 that is related to cancer progression. A decreased risk of colon cancer can be related to consumption of dietary fibers, but the entire mechanism by which this protection occurs remains unclear. Pectin is a type of dietary fiber that possesses β-galactosides and can bind and inhibit galectin-3–mediated effects. Papaya fruit has a massive cell wall disassembling during ripening that naturally changes its pectin structure. Our work shows that different points in the ripening time of papaya fruit exhibit pectins (chelate-soluble fractions; CSF) that can or cannot inhibit galectin-3. The fraction that inhibits galectin-3 (3CSF) also diminishes the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines, and it is derived from an intermediate point of papaya ripening. Therefore, we related this to a papaya pectin structure-dependent effect, and the papaya fruit seems to have a pectin structure that is promising in decreasing the risk of colon cancer development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: As a consequence of its high incidence, breast cancer has become a severe health risk in women. Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for breast cancer, but causes a decline in life quality of patients. Self-care is a non-medical intervention and has been reported to improve the life quality of colorectal cancer patients. We aim to explore whether self-care is also effective in breast cancer. Materials and methods: 85 breast cancer patients under chemotherapy participated in this research, among whom 44 patients received the self-care education. The physical and mental conditions of patients before and after chemotherapy were evaluated by Anxiety Inventory, Rotterdam Symptom checklists and QLQ-C30. Results: The result showed that the occurrence rates of symptoms were significantly reduced after self-care measures. Anxiety Inventory and Rotterdam Symptom checklists indicated that self-care measures could improve both the physical and mental conditions of patients. The Global Quality of Life (QoL) from QLQ-C30 questionnaire further confirmed the effectiveness of self-care measures in breast cancer patients. Conclusions: Based on the results, self-care measures are effective in improving the physical and mental conditions of breast cancer patients under chemotherapy. Self-care measures play an important role in improving patients’ life quality. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Although critical in practice, as well as prevalent, limited effort has gone into understanding the driving factors behind the diffusion of cancer information on social media. This study seeks to comprehensively examine both the content and sender factors that determine cancer information diffusion. Specifically, a multidimensional measure is proposed to capture diffusion characteristics of cancer information, including the scale of information diffusion, structural virality of information diffusion, and the engagement in cancer discussion. A conceptual framework consisting of content and sender factors is proposed based on the heuristic-systematic model to account for cancer information diffusion. Through analyzing information diffusion networks of cancer-related information on Weibo, the results revealed that sender factors played determining roles in affecting information diffusion. The content factors also significantly predicted information diffusion. The factors driving engagement are substantially different from those of scale and virality of information diffusion. Implications for both information diffusion theories and cancer education on social media are discussed. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Arsenic is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring metalloid that poses a significant risk for human cancer and non-cancer diseases. It is now evident that arsenic contamination in food, especially rice and grains, presents a significant exposure to hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. However, the disease risk from chronic exposure to the low amounts of arsenic found in food remains to be established. Thus, this research estimates the global burdens of disease expressed as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for lung, skin and bladder cancers, as well as coronary heart disease (CHD) attributable to inorganic arsenic in food. To determine foodborne inorganic arsenic exposures worldwide, we used the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of food consumption in 17 country clusters, in conjunction with the reported measurements of total and inorganic arsenic in different foods. We estimated cancer potency factors for arsenic related bladder and lung cancers, and from US Environmental Protection Agency risk estimates for skin cancer to calculate the cancer incidence in males and females within each of the WHO member states. Summary relative risk estimates and population attributable fractions were developed to estimate the YLD, YLL, and DALYs for arsenic-induced CHD. The findings indicate that, globally, each year the combined DALYs for all cancers attributable to inorganic arsenic in food are approximately 1.4 million with variation in global distribution based on population and food consumption patterns. The global burden of CHD attributable to foodborne inorganic arsenic also varied with WHO region and may contribute as much as 49 million DALYs. However, in contrast to cancer burden, there is a threshold effect for arsenic-associated CHD with no increased risk of heart disease at the expected lower bound of arsenic consumption in food. These estimates indicate that foodborne arsenic exposure causes a significant yet avoidable global burden of human disease. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The transmembrane glycoprotein epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is overexpressed in most epithelial cancers including breast cancer, where it plays an important role in cancer progression. Previous study has demonstrated that knockdown of EpCAM inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via inhibition of the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9). Although glycosylation is believed to be associated with the function of EpCAM, the contribution of N-glycosylation to this function remains unclear. We constructed the N-glycosylation mutation plasmid of EpCAM and used it to treat breast cancer cells. Loss of N-glycosylation at all three sites EpCAM had no effect on its level of expression or membrane localization. However, mutation at glycosylation sites significantly reduced the ability of EpCAM to promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer. N-glycosylation mutation of EpCAM led to decrease phosphorylation of Raf, ERK, and Akt, and inhibited the Ras/Raf/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated that N-glycosylation mutation of EpCAM-mediated invasion and metastasis of breast carcinoma cells required the downregulation of MMP-9 via inhibition of these two signaling pathways. Our results identified the characteristics and function of EpCAM glycosylation. These data could illuminate molecular regulation of EpCAM by glycosylation and promote our understanding of the application of glycosylated EpCAM as a target for breast cancer therapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "TRIM32 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which has been associated with tumorigenesis. However, its expression and potential functional role(s) in lung cancer progression have not been fully understood. To evaluate the relationship between the expression of TRIM32 and the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, an independent data set (The Human Protein Atlas website) was introduced. The expression and function analysis of TRIM32 in lung cancer cell lines were also performed by using cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, transwell, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Our data showed that TRIM32 was overexpressed in lung cancer tissues and cell lines and was associated with a poor prognosis. TRIM32 silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and the activation of janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. The results showed knockdown of TRIM32 in NCI-H446 cells also inhibited cell growth in nude mice in the xenograft model. Additionally, TRIM32 overexpression promoted lung cancer cell proliferation and motility and mediated the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 were inhibited by JAK2/STAT3 signaling inhibitor (AG490). Taken together, our findings suggest that TRIM32 may regulate lung cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and motility through activating the JAK2/STAT3-signaling pathway and may be a novel and promising target for lung cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: While there is no level 1 evidence supporting the use of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for non-rectal colon cancer in the modern chemotherapy era, there are studies that suggest a local control benefit. This treatment modality is not part of standard treatment recommendations, and we hypothesized that adjuvant RT provides a benefit in locally advanced disease. Due to the limited number who receive post-operative RT, a national database was searched to provide sufficient power. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was performed. Inclusion criteria were: non-rectal colon cancer, AJCC 6th or 7th edition T4 and M0, oncologic resection, and 1st cancer site. Patients were excluded for RT prior to or during surgery, or if the sequence of RT was unknown. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, the relative risk of cause-specific mortality for “RT after surgery” versus “No RT” was calculated. Results: 21,789 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria. Of these, only 1001 received adjuvant RT, and 64% were node-positive (53% RT vs. 65% no RT). When comparing RT vs. no RT, after adjusting for sex, age, N stage, and grade, we determined the relative risk of death from cancer was 0.8849 (95% CI: 0.8008–0.9779; p = 0.0165), suggesting that only 14 patients with T4 disease need receive adjuvant radiation to spare a cancer-related death. Conclusions: Adjuvant RT is not routinely utilized for definitive treatment of T4 non-rectal colon cancer, but this analysis shows a significant cause-specific survival benefit. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prostate cancer is the fifth cause of death among men worldwide. Patients suffering resistant prostate tumor, unresponsive to common treatments, can only be treated with palliative therapy. Materials and methods: Ruthenium(II) carbosilane metallodendrimers containing arene moieties were evaluated as a novel antitumor nanotherapy against resistant prostate cancer. The preclinical evaluation included relevant in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo assays, in an experimental mice model of human prostate cancer. Results: Promising cytotoxic, antiproliferative and antimetastatic behaviors were observed. After treatment with these nanocompounds, mice underwent a significant reduction of tumor volume, in comparison to non-treated animals. Conclusions: The selective antitumor behavior and the lack of toxicity, potentially make ruthenium(II) metallodendrimers promising agents for cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Molecular subtype predicts the prognosis of early-stage breast cancer patients. We assessed the long-term outcomes of breast cancer ≤2 cm treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and stratified according to an immunohistochemically (IHC)-based subtype definition. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted from a prospectively collected database. Included patients had pT1, any N, M0 breast cancer after BCS (without anti-HER2 therapy) and available information on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 status, Ki-67 index. Five IHC-defined subtypes were identified: luminal A-like (ER and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative/Ki-67 < 20%), luminal B-like/HER2-negative (ER and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative/Ki-67 ≥ 20%), luminal B-like/HER2-positive (ER and/or PR-positive/HER2-positive/any Ki-67 value), HER2-positive/nonluminal (ER and PR-negative/HER2-positive), and triple-negative (ER and PR-negative/HER2-negative). Results: We analyzed 184 (65%) luminal A-like, 57 (20%) luminal B-like/HER2-negative, 17 (6%) luminal B-like/HER2-positive, 6 (2%) HER2-positive/nonluminal, and 18 (7%) triple-negative patients. Median follow-up was 112 (interquartile range 94-125) mo. The cumulative 5- and 10-y local recurrence (LR) rates were 1.5% and 4%, respectively. The cumulative 5- and 10-y distant recurrence (DR) rates were 3% and 8%, respectively. The Cox regression revealed that HER2-positive/nonluminal subtypes had the highest risk of LR (P = 0.0025). The luminal B-like/HER2-positive subtypes had the highest risk of DR (P = 0.0019). HER2 positivity carried a higher risk of DR in women with luminal breast cancer who completed 5 y of adjuvant hormonal therapy (P = 0.02). Conclusions: The IHC-defined subtype impacts on the prognosis of breast cancer ≤2 cm after BCS, determining significant differences in LR and DR rates. In the pre–“anti-HER2 therapy” era, patients with HER2-positive/nonluminal or luminal B-like/HER2-positive subtype had worse long-term outcomes than those with luminal A-like subtype. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To examine plasma levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in association with survival among women with breast cancer who participated in a population-based case-control study. Methods: Participants included 456 white and 292 black women from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study Phase I who were diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from 1993 to 1996, and who had available DDE/DDT and lipid measurements from blood samples obtained on average 4.1 months after diagnosis. Using the National Death Index, we identified 392 deaths (210 from breast cancer) over a median follow-up of 20.6 years. We used Cox regression to estimate covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause and breast cancer-specific 5-year mortality, and 20-year mortality conditional on 5-year survival, for lipid-standardized DDE and DDT levels. Associations stratified by race and estrogen receptor (ER) status were also examined. Results: The highest versus lowest DDE tertile and the highest vs non-detectable DDT quantile were associated with HRs of 1.95 (95% CI = 1.31–2.92) and 1.64 (95% CI = 1.10–2.44), respectively, for 20-year conditional all-cause mortality. DDE levels above versus below the median were associated with a HR of 1.69 (95% CI = 1.06–2.68) for 20-year conditional breast cancer-specific mortality among women overall, and HRs were 2.36 (95% CI = 1.03–5.42) among black women and 1.57 (95% CI = 0.86–2.89) among white women (P Interaction = 0.42), and 3.24 (95% CI = 1.38–7.58) among women with ER − tumors and 1.29 (95% CI = 0.73–2.28) among women with ER + tumors (P Interaction = 0.03). Conclusion: Exposure to DDE/DDT may adversely impact overall and breast cancer-specific survival. DDE exposure may contribute to the racial disparities in breast cancer survival. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer stage at diagnosis is a critical prognostic factor regarding a patient's health outcomes. It has yet to be shown whether insurance status across different race has any implications on the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate whether insurance status was a modifier of the association between race and stage of previously undetected prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis in Florida between 1995 and 2013. Methods: Secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional survey using information from the Florida Cancer Data System (n = 224,819). Study participants included black and white males diagnosed with prostate cancer in Florida between 1995 and 2013. The main outcome variable was stage of prostate cancer at diagnosis. The main independent variable was race (black vs white). Adjusted logistic regression models were used to explore the association between race, insurance status and stage at diagnosis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Results: Black males were more likely to be diagnosed with late stage prostate cancer (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.27–1.35). Being uninsured (OR 2.28; 95% CI 2.13–2.45) or having Medicaid (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.70–1.98) was associated with a diagnosis of late stage cancer. Stratified analysis for health insurance revealed that blacks had an increased risk for late stage cancer if uninsured (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07–1.55) and if having Medicare (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.31–1.48). Conclusion: Insurance status may modify the effect of race on late stage prostate cancer in black patients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) may be the first manifestation of an underlying cancer. We aimed to assess the period prevalence of occult cancer detection stratified by VTE location (deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE] or both) and the anatomical relationship between occult cancer and VTE. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of adults with unprovoked VTE with at least 12 months of follow-up. Cancer types were grouped according to thoracic, abdomino-pelvic, or other locations. Results: A total of 2300 patients were eligible including 1218 with DVT only (53%), 719 with PE only (31%), and 363 with both PE and DVT (16%). The pooled 12-month period prevalence of cancer in DVT only, PE only, and DVT + PE was 5.6% (95% CI, 4.4 to 7.2), 4.3% (95% CI, 2.7 to 6.9), and 5.6% (95% CI, 1.7 to 15.5), respectively. Most occult cancers were located in the abdomen (68.4%). The proportion of patients with an abdomino-pelvic cancer was not different in patients with DVT + PE (81%; 95% CI, 54 to 96) than in those with DVT (68%; 95% CI, 57 to 78) or PE alone (65%; 95% CI, 48 to 79). Conclusion: The 12-month prevalence of occult cancer was similar in patients with DVT only, PE only, or both. Most cancers were located in the abdomen, and there was no relationship between VTE type and cancer location. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is one of the most common female malignancies around the world, and radiation resistance is a major obstacle to cancer therapy. Previously, overexpression of the long noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been found to be associated with the invasion and metastasis capacities of several epithelial cancers, including cervical cancer. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of HOTAIR in cervical cancer resistance to radiotherapy, we investigated cellular autophagy and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in radioresistant human cervical cancer HeLa cells when HOTAIR was suppressed. HOTAIR levels were quantified in cancerous and noncancerous cervical tissues obtained from 108 patients with cervical cancer. Next, we inhibited HOTAIR by RNA interference and activated the Wnt signaling pathway by LiCl in radioresistant HeLa cells to investigate the regulatory mechanisms for the HOTAIR mediating Wnt signaling pathway. We determined that the upregulated HOTAIR may contribute to cervical cancer progression. We found that the short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of HOTAIR disturbed the Wnt signaling pathway, reduced autophagy, inhibited EMT, decreased cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in radioresistant HeLa cells. It is worthy to note that the combination treatment of siRNA-HOTAIR and LiCl demonstrated that the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is responsible for the beneficial effect of HOTAIR knockdown in enhancing sensitivity to radiotherapy in radioresistant HeLa cells. Together, our results revealed an important role of HOTAIR in regulating cervical cancer resistance to radiotherapy. Functional suppression of HOTAIR could enhance sensitivity to radiotherapy by reduction of autophagy and reversal of EMT through the suppression of the Wnt signaling pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib is widely used to treat melanomas harboring the activated BRAF V600E mutation; however, vemurafenib showed poor efficacy in colon cancer, which impeded its clinical application for colon cancer patients with this mutation. The specific mechanism of vemurafenib resistance is not clear in colon cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation influenced vemurafenib sensitivity in BRAF V600E mutant colon cancer cells. When vemurafenib was applied to two colon cancer cell lines with the BRAF V600E mutation, STAT3 was continuously activated after 6 hours. Furthermore, BCL-2 was upregulated in RKO colon cancer cells, while STAT3 remained unchanged in HT-29 colon cancer cells. This suggested that STAT3 signaling might be involved in vemurafenib sensitivity. Combining the STAT3 inhibitor STATTIC with vemurafenib further inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis by downregulating STAT3 and BCL-2 expression in RKO cells. Further studies showed that interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion increased after RKO cells were treated with vemurafenib. STAT3 activation was induced by adding IL-6 to the supernatant, and IL-6 increased STAT3 and BCL-2 expression and antagonized vemurafenib sensitivity in HT-29 cells. Together, these results suggest that STAT3 activation maybe related to vemurafenib sensitivity in colon cancer cells, and that combining STAT3 inhibitors with vemurafenib may be a promising treatment for BRAF V600E mutant colon cancers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Preclinical data suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors may promote metastatic progression of preexisting cancer via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation. We aimed to investigate the association between different glucose-lowering treatments, including DPP-4 inhibitors and metformin, both with potential NRF2 modulating effects, and new-onset metastatic cancer among type 2 diabetes patients with comorbid incident cancer. This population-based cohort study included 223,530 diabetic patients newly diagnosed with primary cancer during 2009–2011 in Korea. The patients were categorized into five study cohorts in accordance with treatment modalities during the follow-up until the end of 2016: no-antidiabetic drugs (no-AD), metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors, and insulin treatment. After propensity score (PS) matching in a 1:1 ratio against the no-AD group, 18,805 patients in metformin, 1,865 in DPP-4 inhibitors, 31,074 in metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors, and 1,895 patients in insulin groups were identified for cohort entry and analyzed against the corresponding number of no-AD patients in each PS-matched comparison pair. Metastatic risk was lower with metformin plus or minus DPP-4 inhibitors (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79–0.90 and 0.87, 0.80–0.95, respectively), not significantly associated with DPP-4 inhibitors (0.99, 0.77–1.29) except after thyroid cancer (3.89, 1.01–9.64), and higher with insulin therapy (1.81, 1.46–2.24) compared to no-AD use for all cancers combined. In conclusion, DPP-4 inhibitor therapy was not associated with significant risk of cancer metastasis relative to no-AD therapy, irrespective of patient age and sex, except after thyroid cancer, while metastatic risk was decreased with metformin treatment among type 2 diabetes patients with preexisting cancer. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a serious health problem till now, with nearly 500,000 women cases diagnosed each year around the world. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a novel class of RNA transcripts (>200 nucleotides in length) participating in gene transcription, cell proliferation, differentiation, and drug resistance. This study aimed to explore the regulatory relationship among lncRNA NCK1-AS1, miR-134-5p, and MutS protein homolog 2 (MSH2), so that the resistance against cisplatin in cervical cancer treatment could be better understood. Comprehensive lncRNA profiling analysis was performed to screen lncRNAs differentially expressed in cervical cancer. The expression patterns of miR-134-5p, NCK1-AS1, and MSH2 were evaluated in cancerous tissues and adjacent normal tissues obtained from 75 cervical cancer patients. Subsequently, anti-NCK1-AS1 small interfering RNA, miR-134-5p mimics, and miR-134-5p inhibitors were transfected into cervical cancer cells, and the effects of these transcripts on cisplatin resistance and cell apoptosis were investigated. The regulatory relationship among NCK1-AS1, miR-134-5p, and MSH2 was identified using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and the results were further validated by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Based on the microarray data of GSE63514 and GSE27678, NCK1-AS1 was upregulated in cervical cancer. Increased expression of NCK1-AS1, MSH2, and decreased expression of miR-134-5p were observed in cervical cancer tissues. In addition, NCK1-AS1 competitively bound to miR-134-5p to regulate MSH2. Therefore, si-NCK1-AS1 and miR-134-5p mimic both reduced MSH2 activity and increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Taken together, NCK1-AS1 may become a novel target in improving the chemotherapeutic response and survival of cervical cancer patients. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cell fusion plays a crucial role in cancer progression and leads to massive aberrant changes in chromosome and gene expression involved in tumor metastasis. Cancer cells can fuse with many cell types, including stromal cells, epithelial cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to migrate and incorporate into tumor sites during cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanism of stem cell fusion in tumor metastasis has not been fully deciphered. In this research, we established a cell fusion model between lung cancer cells and MSCs in vitro. We found that the hybrid cells showed enhanced metastatic capacity with increased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas the proliferation ability was inhibited and cell cycle was blocked in the G0/G1 phase with elevated expression of p21, p27, and p53. Moreover, the hybrid cells lost epithelial morphology and exhibited an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) change with downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, Vimentin, α-SMA and Fibronectin1. Meanwhile, the expressions of EMT transcription factors, including Snail1, Slug, Twist1, Zeb1, and Zeb2, were also increased in hybrid cells. More important, the fusion hybrids acquired stem cell-like properties, which exhibited increased expression stem cell transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Kif4 as well as Bmi1. Taken together, our results suggested that cell fusion between lung cancer cells and MSCs offered enhanced metastatic capacity and characteristics of cancer stem cell by undergoing EMT. This study will contribute to explaning the origin of lung cancer stem cells and to elucidate the role of cell fusion in cancer metastasis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Actually, the most common cancer in women is the breast cancer which is the second most widespread cancer overall. In 2018, there were over two million new cases of women breast cancer. Particularly, we tried to extract chitosan from crayfish Procambarus clarkii, Crustacea: Cambaridae, by N-deacetylation of chitin. The chemical structure of chitosan was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Also DDA was calculated from FT-IR and ultraviolet spectrophotometry data. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using a ball-milling technique. The as-prepared chitosan nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering as well as zeta potential. The cytotoxicity of chitosan and its nanoparticles (50 and 100 μg/mL) against human breast cancer (SK BR3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines) was evaluated. MTT assay asserts the significant inhibitory action of both chitosan and its nanoparticles on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Chitosan nanoparticles had more anti-proliferative effects on MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cell lines than its corresponding chitosan. Although, chitosan nanoparticles, that has higher DDA, had a higher cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cell lines in vitro. Eventually, chitosan and its nanoparticles can be considered as a promising natural compounds in human breast cancer treatment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is a major cause of death globally, and particularly in developed countries. Breast cancer is influenced by cholesterol membrane content, by affecting the signaling pathways modulating cell growth, adherence, and migration. Furthermore, steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and these play a key role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Although most findings have reported an inverse association between serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level and the risk of breast cancer, there have been some reports of the opposite, and the association therefore remains unclear. HDL is principally known for participating in reverse cholesterol transport and has an inverse relationship with the cardiovascular risk. HDL is heterogeneous, with particles varying in composition, size, and structure, which can be altered under different circumstances, such as inflammation, aging, and certain diseases. It has also been proposed that HDL functionality might have a bearing on the breast cancer. Owing to the potential role of cholesterol in cancer, its reduction using statins, and particularly as an adjuvant during chemotherapy may be useful in the anticancer treatment, and may also be related to the decline in cancer mortality. Reconstituted HDLs have the ability to release chemotherapeutic drugs inside the cell. As a consequence, this may be a novel way to improve therapeutic targeting for the breast cancer on the basis of detrimental impacts of oxidized HDL on cancer development. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in women. Triple-negative breast cancer consists 15% to 20% of breast cancer cases and has a poor prognosis. Cancerous transformation has several causes one of which is dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) expression. Exosomes can transfer miRNAs to neighboring and distant cells. Thus, exosomal miRNAs can transfer cancerous phenotype to distant cells. We used gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets and miRNA target prediction tools to find overexpressed miRNA in breast cancer cells and their target genes, respectively. Exosomes were extracted from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and characterized. Overexpression of the miRNAs of MDA-MB-231 cells and their exosomes were analyzed using quantitative Real-time PCR. The target genes expression was also evaluated in the cell lines. Luciferase assay was performed to confirm the miRNAs: mRNAs interactions. Finally, MCF-7 cells were treated with MDA-MB-231 cells’ exosomes. The target genes expression was evaluated in the recipient cells. GSE60714 results indicated that miR-9 and miR-155 were among the overexpressed miRNAs in highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells and their exosomes. Bioinformatic studies showed that these two miRNAs target PTEN and DUSP14 tumor suppressor genes. Quantitative Real-time PCR confirmed the overexpression of the miRNAs and downregulation of their targets. Luciferase assay confirmed that the miRNAs target PTEN and DUSP14. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with MDA-MB-231 cells’ exosomes resulted in target genes downregulation in MCF-7 cells. We found that miR-9 and miR-155 were enriched in metastatic breast cancer exosomes. Therefore, exosomal miRNAs can transfer from cancer cells to other cells and can suppress their target genes in the recipient cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to take part in intracellular RNA regulatory networks and play important roles in a lot of pathological processes. Currently, lncRNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) has been proved to regulate cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis in a series of cancers. In this study, we explored whether XIST can affect cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in bladder cancer. The influences of XIST on the cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were detected in bladder cancer cells. The effect of XIST on the migration of bladder cancer cells was examined by cell migration assay. Through RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, the binding relationship between XIST and TET1 and the regulatory mechanism of TET1 on p53 were examined. Western blot was performed to detect p53 after knockdown or overexpression of XIST. We found that knockdown of XIST suppressed cell migration and proliferation in vitro. Mechanistically, we confirmed that lncRNA XIST participates in bladder cancer by downregulating p53 via binding to TET1. In conclusion, our research revealed the potential role of XIST-TET1-p53 regulatory network in bladder cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "HPV16 is the predominant type of HPV causing invasive cervical cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the unparalleled carcinogenic power of HPV16 compared to other types of high-risk (HR)-HPV including HPV18 remains elusive. The PDZ binding motif (PBM) of high-risk HPV E6 plays an important role in neoplasia and progression of cervical cancer. HPV16 E6 rather than HPV18 E6, interacted with NHERF1 by its PBM region, and induced degradation of NHERF1. NHERF1 retarded the assembly of cytoskeleton by downregulation of ACTN4, thereby inhibited the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells in both cell and mouse model. HPV16 E6 was confirmed to enhance actin polymerization with increased ACTN4 level by downregulation of NHERF1, and result in enhanced migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. GSEA analysis of cervical cancer specimens also showed that HPV16 E6 rather than HPV18 E6, was significantly associated with actin cytoskeleton assembly. That downregulation of NHERF1 by HPV16 E6 promoted cytoskeleton assembly and cell invasion, was an important cause in cervical cancer carcinogenesis. These findings provided the differential mechanism between HPV16 E6 and HPV18 E6 in the development and progression of cervical cancer, which may partially explain the differences of carcinogenic power between these two types of HR-HPVs. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Background: NKX3.1 is a tumor suppressor frequently lost in prostate cancer. Previous studies by others indicated that the risks associated with reduced NKX3.1 levels can be enhanced by anti-oxidant supplementation. Selenium is an essential component of several proteins with anti-oxidant functions and lower levels of selenium have been associated with greater risk of prostate cancer. In contrast, participants of the select prostate cancer prevention trial were at increased risk of prostate cancer when supplemented with selenium when their baseline selenium levels were high. Methods: In order to investigate whether there was an interaction between a functional polymorphism in NKX3.1 that results in less protein and selenium status with prostate cancer grade or outcome, plasma selenium levels and the genotypes of NKX3.1 and the selenium carrier protein SELENOP were determined from a cohort of men who underwent radical protatectomy. Results: NKX3.1 and SELENOP genotypes were associated with a more aggressive prostate tumor grade at the time of prostatectomy, but there were no significant interactions of NKX3.1 genotype with either selenium status or SELENOP genotype. There was also a significant association between NKX3.1 genotype and prostate cancer recurrence, however this association was modified by SELENOP genotype, but not with plasma selenium levels. Conclusions: These data indicate that the impact of selenium status on prostate cancer may be influenced by factors other than the amount of selenium in circulation. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional chemotherapeutic and photodynamic therapy have recently been shown to also elicit immune response against cancer through the immunogenic cell death mechanism, which can be potentially translated into effective cancer vaccines. However, there are few studies on the potential of nanodelivery system to promote the immunogenic cell death as a cancer vaccine. We reported here that cRGD target liposome delivery system was capable to promote the immunogenic cell death through enhanced potency of a thymidine conjugate post UVA activation as a cancer vaccine. Liposomes and cRGD target liposomes were found to significantly increase the cellular accumulation of the thymidine conjugate and subsequently translated into enhanced cytotoxic potency after UVA activation. More importantly, cRGD target liposomes of the thymidine conjugate markedly promoted the early detection of immunogenic cell death markers including ATP, HMGB1 and calreticulin. Subsequent in vivo vaccination−challenge study confirmed effective tumor growth inhibition by the cRGD liposomal thymidine conjugate and UVA treated cancer cells as the cancer vaccine. In addition, liposomes and cRGD target liposomes alone did not shown any induction of the immunogenic cell death markers, revealing the adjuvant nature of the nanodelivery system. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA HOXD cluster antisense RNA 1 (HOXD-AS1) has been found to play a crucial role in the tumorigenesis and progression of human cancer. However, the role of HOXD-AS1 in papillary thyroid cancer is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical value and biological function of HOXD-AS1 in papillary thyroid cancer. The results showed HOXD-AS1 is overexpressed in papillary thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines compared with matching nontumor tissue specimens and normal thyroid cell line, respectively. High expression of HOXD-AS1 was associated with elderly people, advanced clinical stage, large tumor size, present lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. There was no significant correlation between HOXD-AS1 expression and disease-free survival or overall survival in this cohort from the TCGA database. The study in vitro suggested reduced HOXD-AS1 expression inhibited papillary thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted cell-cycle arrest. In conclusion, HOXD-AS1 is a biomarker for predicting clinical progression in papillary thyroid cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Metaplastic breast cancer (MPBC) is a rare subtype that accounts for <1% of all breast cancers. Although these are typically “triple negative,” they are relatively chemotherapy-refractory compared to conventional triple negative invasive breast cancers with more aggressive features and an overall poor prognosis. MPBC is a heterogeneous group of tumors that are enriched for TP53 and PIK3CA mutations, and have been found to have high PD-L1 expression though the mechanisms underlying its immunogenicity remain unclear. We perform comprehensive genomic profiling in the largest MPBC dataset (n = 192) to date and assess for other potential biomarkers of immune response. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the Golestan province, Northern Iran. The purpose of this study is to describe colorectal cancer incidence patterns and trends in the province 2004–2013. Methods: Data on CRC cases were obtained from the Golestan Population-based Cancer Registry (GPCR). The GPCR is a high-quality cancer registry that collects data on primary cancers according to internationally accepted standard protocols. Age-standardized Incidence rates (ASR) were calculated and the 10-year trend quantified using the average annual percentage change (AAPC) from Joinpoint regressions. Results: The overall ASR of CRC were higher in men (14.8 per 100,000 person-years) and the urban populations (35.4), relative to women (11.5) and the rural populations (17.1), respectively. The overall incidence rate was observed to significantly increase 2004–2013 in men (AAPC = 7.3; 95%CI: 2.9–11.8) and women (AAPC = 6.6; 95%CI: 2.7–10.6). The analysis also showed that urban areas (AAPC = 8.1; 95%CI: 2.4–14.1) had a relatively more rapid increase in rates compared to rural areas (AAPC = 6.9; 95%CI: 2.2–11.7). Conclusions: CRC incidence rates in Golestan have been rising during the most recent decade, with a higher incidence and more rapid increases among men and the urban populations. The underlying risk factors should be assessed in the context of developing CRC prevention interventions in Golestan. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a common and lethal cancer in digestive system. This study investigated the potential oncogenic effects of lncRNA HULC on pancreatic cancer. Briefly, qRT-PCR was conducted to measure the expression of HULC and miR-15a in pancreatic tissues and cells. Cell transfection was used to change the expression of HULC and miR-15a in pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells. The viability, migration and invasion and apoptosis of Panc-1 cells after relevant transfection were detected using CCK-8 assay, two chamber transwell assay and Guava Nexin assay, respectively. Results found that HULC had a higher expression level, while miR-15a had a lower expression level in pancreatic cancer tissues. Overexpression of HULC promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of Panc-1 cells. Suppression of HULC had opposite effects and dramatically induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, HULC negatively regulated the expression of miR-15a in Panc-1 cells. miR-15a participated in the effects of HULC on Panc-1 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of HULC activated PI3K/AKT pathway in Panc-1 cells by down-regulating miR-15a. In conclusion, HULC exerted oncogenic role in pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of HULC promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by down-regulating miR-15a and then activating PI3K/AKT pathway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer remains one of the main factors leading to tumor-related death worldwide. Many strategies of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy are developed and used nowadays. However, for the cancer chemotherapy resistance, reduction of the limitation of cancer chemotherapy efficacy is one of the aims of several oncology teams. Moreover, the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6-cyclin D-retinoblastoma protein-E2F pathway is an important mechanism for cell cycle control and its dysregulation is one of the key factors for cancers development including cervical cancer. Ribociclib is one of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitors and is a new therapeutic approach showing promise as a good strategy of therapy in many human cancers. However, there are not the studies regarding the investigation of effects of Ribociclib in cervical cancer yet. In the present study, by western blotting and immunofluorescence assay, we found respectively that CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 are highly expressed and are mostly localized in the nucleus with some localized in the cytoplasm of cervical cancer cell lines. Moreover, Ribociclib induced cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase and cell apoptosis, and inhibited C33A cell proliferation in dose – dependent manner following by decreased expression of certain related genes such as CDK4, CDK6, E2F1, P-Rb, and increased Bax expression. In C33A xenografts, Ribociclib inhibited tumor growth associated with decreased expressions of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, Rb and Ki-67, and also significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis. However, we didn't find side effect of Ribociclib concerning heart, liver and kidney perturbation and any Ribociclib anti-tumor effects on HeLa in vitro and in vivo which may be due to Hela cell infection by HPV. Based on our findings, the Rb-E2F pathway can be considered as an important factor in human cervical cancer pathogenesis and as a mechanism of Ribociclib, a potential strategy of treatment for the improvement of new therapeutic measures for the treatment of HPV-negative cervical cancer which application for HPV-positive cervical cancer is desired in further study. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence has suggested that microRNA-449b-5p (miR-449b-5p) plays an important role in the development and progression of multiple cancers. However, little is known about the role of miR-449b-5p in breast cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression level, biological function and underlying mechanism of miR-449b-5p in breast cancer. Our results showed that miR-449b-5p expression was frequently down-regulated in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. The overexpression of miR-449b-5p significantly inhibited growth and invasion, and induced the cell cycle arrest of breast cancer cells. In contrast, the inhibition of miR-449b-5p showed the opposite effect. Interestingly, bioinformatic analysis predicted that cell cycle-related and expression-elevated protein in tumor (CREPT), an important oncogene in breast cancer, was a potential target gene of miR-449b-5p. The overexpression of miR-449b-5p decreased CREPT expression while miR-449b-5p inhibition promoted CREPT expression in breast cancer cells. Restoration of CREPT expression in miR-449b-5p mimics transfected cells partially reversed the suppressive effect of miR-449b-5p on breast cancer cell growth and invasion. Notably, our results showed that miR-449b-5p overexpression decreased the expression of β-catenin and suppressed the activation of Wnt/β-catenin/TCF-4 signaling via targeting CREPT. In addition, blocking Wnt/β-catenin partially reversed the promotion effect of miR-449b-5p inhibition on breast cancer cell growth and invasion. Overall, these results reveal a tumor suppressive role of miR-449b-5p that restricts the growth and invasion of breast cancer cells through targeting CREPT and inhibiting CREPT-mediated activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our study suggests that the miR-449b-5p/CREPT/Wnt/β-catenin axis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and miR-449–5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Breast cancer survivors are increasing in number among survivors of all types of cancer, and survivors returning to work are extremely important. The development of outpatient chemotherapy has increased the working population of patients undergoing cancer therapy. Consequently, a significant number of breast cancer survivors experience physical, psychological, and social problems. This study aimed to clarify differences in concerns among patients with breast cancer receiving outpatient chemotherapy according to their employment status. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with breast cancer undergoing outpatient chemotherapy were recruited. A questionnaire was used to survey the attributes, employment status, and levels of concern in these patients based on the Cancer-chemotherapy Concerns Rating Scale (CCRS). Data from three groups (employed full time, employed part-time, and unemployed) were analyzed using multiple comparison tests. Results: The patients' mean age was (55.1 ± 9.9) years. According to the CCRS findings, the following three parameters differed between the three groups: scores for the items 'I always think about my disease' (employed vs. unemployed, P = 0.005) and 'I can't work (housework/schoolwork)' (employed full time vs. part time, P = 0.045), and scores for the 'self-existence' subscale (employed vs. unemployed, P = 0.024). Conclusions: This study revealed the characteristics of concerns in patients with breast cancer according to their employment status. Being able to continue working is considered to enhance the social health of these patients. Predicting concerns in employed patients will help gain perspective in early nursing interventions. © 2018 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co. Ltd | Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The objective of this study was to examine the influence of Surgical Society Oncology (SSO) membership and National Cancer Institute (NCI) status on the academic output of surgical faculty. Methods: NCI cancer program status for each department of surgery was identified with publically available data, whereas SSO membership was determined for every faculty member. Academic output measures such as NIH funding, publications, and citations were analyzed in subsets by the type of cancer center (NCI comprehensive cancer center [CCC]; NCI cancer center [NCICC]; and non-NCI center) and SSO membership status. Results: Of the surgical faculty, 2537 surgeons (61.9%) were from CCC, whereas 854 (20.8%) were from NCICC. At the CCC, 22.7% of surgeons had a history of or current NIH funding, compared with 15.8% at the NCICC and 11.8% at the non-NCI centers. The academic output of SSO members was higher at NCICC (52 ± 113 publications/1266 ± 3830 citations) and CCC (53 ± 92/1295 ± 4001) compared with nonmembers (NCICC: 26 ± 78/437 ± 2109; CCC: 37 ± 91/670 ± 3260), respectively, P < 0.05. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that SSO membership imparts an additional 22 publications and 270 citations, whereas NCI-designated CCC added 10 additional publications, but not citations. Conclusions: CCCs have significantly higher academic output and NIH funding. Recruitment of SSO members, a focus on higher performing divisions, and NIH funding are factors that non-NCI cancer centers may be able to focus on to improve academic productivity to aid in obtaining NCI designation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumour microenvironments promote cancer cell proliferation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis, leading to tumour growth and metastasis. TAMs have become increasingly recognised as a cancer therapy target, such as in combination therapy with an immunity checkpoint inhibitor. However, the clinical and prognostic features of TAMs, and the relationship between TAMs and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), remain unexplored in oesophageal cancer. Methods: Using a non-biased database of 305 resected oesophageal cancer preparations, we evaluated the expression of two M2-like macrophage markers (CD163 and CD204) and PD-L1 on tumour cells by immunostaining. Through in vitro assays, we examined how TAMs influence phenotypic malignancy and PD-L1 expression. Results: High density of CD163 (n = 160) or CD204 (n = 146) was associated with significantly worse overall survival than low expression (log rank P = 0.0025 and 0.018 for CD163 and CD204, respectively). The prognostic effect of TAMs was not significantly modified by any clinical factors (P > 0.05 for all interactions). High TAM density was significantly associated with increased PD-L1 expression. In in vitro assays, cell invasion and migration ability were significantly more upregulated in oesophageal cancer cell lines cocultured with activated macrophages than in control cell lines. Coculture with activated macrophages elevated the PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. Conclusions: High TAM density in oesophageal cancer tissues was associated with shorter survival, suggesting a prognostic biomarker role for TAMs. TAMs also increase PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. Given the significant interest in cancer immunotherapies targeting TAMs and PD-L1, the current findings should have considerable clinical implications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to understand patient-reported perception of participation in a population-based web-survey focusing on sensitive issues for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. Method: A population-based web survey for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors including a matched control group. Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors from the population-based Swedish National Cancer Registry from four of the six register holders at Regional Cancer Centers in Sweden. Controls were randomly identified from the Swedish National Population registry, from the same register holders. Result: Of 729 eligible participants, 540 completed the survey i.e. 74% participation rate. The study population included 285 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors and 255 matched controls. None of the participants answered that the survey had a very negative impact on them and a minority of 43 (7.9%) of the 540 responded that they were mildly negatively affected by their participation in the study. There was a no significant difference between patients and controls regarding the negative effect of the participation (p = 0.29). Positive experiences of participating in the study were widely expressed and most participants (95%) found the study valuable. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the benefits clearly outweigh the risks when adolescent and young adult cancer survivors participate in surveys including sensitive and trauma-related aspects, given that the study design is ethically sound and participants are approached carefully. We also present a modified ethical protocol for epidemiological surveys on adolescents and young adult cancer survivors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Although mortality continues to decline over the past two decades, cancer is still a pervasive healthcare problem worldwide due to the increase in the number of cases, multidrug resistance (MDR) and metastasis. As a consequence of multidrug resistance, cancer treatment must rely on a host of chemotherapeutic agents and chemosensitizers to achieve remission. To overcome these problems, a series of biodegradable triblock copolymers of PEG, guanidinium-functionalized polycarbonate and polylactide (PEG-PGC x -PDLA y ) is designed as chemotherapeutic agents. These copolymers self-assemble into micellar nanoparticles, and are highly effective against various cancer cell lines including human breast cancer (BCap37), liver cancer (HepG2), lung cancer (A549) and epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cell lines as well as MDR Bats-72 and Bads-200 cancer cells that were developed from BCap37. Multiple treatments with the polymers at sub-lethal doses do not induce resistance. The polymers kill cancer cells by a non-apoptotic mechanism with significant vacuolization and subsequent membrane disruption. In vivo antitumor efficacy is evaluated in a metastatic 4T1 subcutaneous tumor model. Treatment with stereocomplexes of PEG-PGC 43 -PLLA 19 and PEG-PGC 43 -PDLA 20 at a dose of 20 mg/kg of mouse body weight suppresses tumor growth and inhibits tumor metastasis in vivo. These polymers show promise in the treatment of cancer without the onset of resistance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: England has significantly higher mortality risks due to Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) compared with other European countries. Early diagnosis is important as it is likely to increase early-stage diagnosis and improve survival and better quality of life. This study sought to improve understanding of the intervals from first symptom recognition to diagnosis for HNC and investigate associations between patient-reported symptoms and socio-demographic factors. Methods: People within 3 months of diagnosis, completed a researcher-administered questionnaire and data were extracted from primary and secondary care clinical records. Results: Eighty (mean age 62.9 [SD 11.7] years; 66% men) were interviewed. The appraisal interval was longer than a month for 39% of participants and the help-seeking interval was longer than a week for 44%. The median diagnostic interval was 92 (IQR; 34-172) days. Appraisal intervals of > 1 month were associated with male gender, ulceration and persistent throat pain. The only symptom that associated with a help-seeking interval of > 1 week was ulceration. Participants who reported red/white patches in the mouth and ulceration were associated with a reduced likelihood of a diagnostic interval of > 3 months. A higher proportion of participants with a diagnostic interval of > 3 months were diagnosed with advanced disease (78%) than those with an interval < 3 months (68%). Conclusion: These data improve understanding of the intervals from first symptom recognition to HNC diagnosis and provide preliminary evidence to identify targets to reduce overall time to diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To compare the fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with the volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans for different cancers using the biologically effective dose (BED). Methods: Recruited patients were divided into three groups in terms of tumor anatomic site, including head and neck, thoracic, and abdominal cancers. All of plans were generated using the fixed-beam IMRT and the VMAT techniques. The qualities of the plans were assessed using the conformity index (CI) and the homogeneous index (HI) with respect to the dose delivered to the tumors. Some selected organs-at-risk (OARs) were analyzed. For the efficiency of the plan, monitor units (MUs) were compared between the paired plans. All parameters were collected and evaluated based on the conventional dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the paired plans. All BED were calculated from the physical dose. Results: For CI and HI, the fixed-beam IMRT and the VMAT gained significant differences (p < 0.05), mainly in the head and neck (HN) group, with the exception of the CI of the plan gross tumor volume (PGTV) in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) site. In the thoracic group, the HI gained significant differences (p < 0.05) in the plans of the lung cancer with the central tumor without lymph node metastasis. The CI gained significant differences (p < 0.05) in the plans of the lung cancer with the surrounding tumor without lymph node metastasis. The MUs were higher in the VMAT plans compared with the fixed-beam IMRT plans in only two types of cancers. Analysis of the statistical significances regarding the BED values between the fixed-beam IMRT and the VMAT plans were the same as the values of the physical doses when the two paired plans were analyzed. Conclusion: There is no difference in the data comparison of the paired plans using the BED values compared with the physical doses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Topotecan (TPT) is a Topo I inhibitor and shows obvious anti-cancer effects on gastric cancer. Cancer cells reprogram their metabolic pathways to increase nutrients uptake, which has already been a hallmark of cancer. But the effect of TPT on metabolism in gastric cancer remains unknown. Purpose: To investigate the effect of TPT on metabolism in gastric cancer. Methods: ATP production was measured by ATP Assay kit. Glucose and glutamine uptake were measured by Glucose (HK) Assay Kit and Glutamine/Glutamate Determination Kit respectively. To detect glutathione (GSH) concentration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, GSH and GSSG Assay Kit and ROS Assay Kit were adopted. Apoptosis rates, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry and protein levels were analyzed by immumohistochemical staining and western blotting. Results: TPT increased ATP production. TPT promoted glucose uptake possibly via up-regulation of hexokinase 2 (HK2) or glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression, while decreased glutamine uptake by down-regulation of ASCT2 expression. ASCT2 inhibitor GPNA and ASCT2 knockdown significantly suppressed the growth of gastric cancer cells. Inhibition of ASCT2 reduced glutamine uptake which led to decreased production of GSH and increased ROS level. ASCT2 knockdown induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway and weakened anti-cancer effect of TPT. Conclusion: TPT inhibits glutamine uptake via down-regulation of ASCT2 which causes oxidative stress and induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Moreover, TPT inhibits proliferation partially via ASCT2. These observations reveal a previously undescribed mechanism of ASCT2 regulated gastric cancer proliferation and demonstrate ASCT2 is a potential anti-cancer target of TPT. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) affects cancer cell characteristics. Inability of normal epithelial cells to attach to the ECM induces apoptosis (anoikis). Cancer cells are often anoikis resistant, a prerequisite for their metastatic spread. Previously we demonstrated that the placenta manipulates its surrounding ECM in a way that prevents breast cancer cells (BCCL) attachment and induces their motility and aggregation. This fits with the fact that although breast cancer during pregnancy is often advanced, metastasis to the placenta is rarely observed. Placental intervillous space provides suitable conditions for cancer cell arrival. Yet, the outcome of the short communication between the placental ECM to the BCCL and its effect on BCCL malignant potential are unknown, and are the focus of our study. In the current study we analyzed the effect of placental ECM on BCCL survival pathways and drug resistance. Microarray analysis suggested activation of the NF-κB and stress response pathways. Indeed, the placenta-conditioned ECM induced autophagy in ERα + BCCL, inactivated the NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) and increased integrin α5 in the BCCL. The autophagy mediated MCF-7 and T47D migration and the placental ECM-BCCL interactions reduced the BCCL sensitivity to Taxol. We also demonstrated by using siRNA that integrin α5 was responsible for the MCF-7 autophagy and suggest this molecule as a suitable target for therapy. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) in breast cancer reduces recurrence risk and increases overall survival. The aim of the study was to quantify non-adherence and discontinuation to ET in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, and identify possible clinical or social risk factors. Methods: Women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (N = 138), mean age 58 (SD 9.3) years, filled in 4 questionnaires within 1–12, 24, 36 and 48–60 months after surgery; Subjective Health Complaints Inventory (SHC), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Social Support Subscale (FACT-ES), and Quality of Patient Information Questionnaire (QPI). Adherence to Tamoxifen (Tam) or Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) was examined using the self-reported Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and data from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated adherence to ET. Results: The estimate of discontinued ET within 60 months was 38%. Self-reported discontinuation was 7% compared with 25% from the NorPD. Being overweight or obese were significantly time dependent factors predictive for discontinuing ET, p = 0.025. Conclusion: Closer follow-ups, tailor-made information about the proven benefits of ET, and keeping a normal body mass index (BMI) may improve adherence to ET in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Scandenolone, an isoflavone, has shown anti-cancer potential. In this study, we extracted scandenolone from Cudrania tricuspidata fruit and evaluated its anti-breast cancer effects as well as toxicity in cell and animal models. In cell model, scandenolone suppressed the breast cancer MCF-7 cells viability, ceased mitotic cell cycle, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, up-regulated cleaved caspase-3 and promoted the phosphorylation of p53. Additionally, this isoflavone promoted cell apoptosis and induced a sustained activation of the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, but not JNK and Akt. The effects were further verified in a human MCF-7 breast cancer xenograft model, where scandenolone efficiently suppressed the cancer growth and increased apoptotic cells in tumor tissue. However scandenolone has also shown certain toxicity to normal hepatocytes and breast epithelial cells. It could be concluded that scandenolone suppressed the growth of breast cancer cells, but its toxicity towards normal cells might limit its potential clinical use. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Herein, our aim is to develop a drug-free method without obvious side effects to treat cancer through biomineralization of biocompatible inorganic nanomaterials targeting onto cells’ membrane to block transport proteins. We selected chondroitin sulfate as optimal target agent and linker to induce the in situ biomineralization of exogenous Ca 2+ and CO 3 2− at safe concentration to generate biocompatible calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) nanostructures targeting onto cancer cells’ membrane. The in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that the generated CaCO 3 nanostructures could significantly inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Mechanism studies demonstrated that the mineralized CaCO 3 nanostructures could bind with 66 membrane proteins. Deeply research revealed that the CaCO 3 nanostructures could mainly block transport proteins, e.g. sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase, leading to the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the increase of the lactate dehydrogenase release into medium, and finally modulated cell cycle and induced the apoptosis of cancer cells. Our results may introduce promising possibilities for efficient and specific cancer treatment by producing biocompatible nanomaterials to block transport proteins. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is the second most common in Malaysia and the fourth frequent cancer among women in worldwide. Pap smear test is often ignored although it is actually useful, beneficial and essential as screening tool for cervical cancer. However, Pap smear images have low sensitivity as well as specificity. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the abnormal cells are cancerous or not. Recently, computer-based algorithms are widely used in cervical cancer screening. In this study, an improved cellular neural network (CNN) algorithm is proposed as the solution to detect the cancerous cells in real-time by undergoing the image processing of Pap smear images. A few templates are combined and modified to form an ideal CNN algorithm to detect the cancerous cells in total of 115 Pap smear images. A MATLAB based CNN is developed for an automated detection of cervix cancerous cells where the templates segmented the nucleus of the cells. From the simulation results, our proposed CNN algorithm can detect the cervix cancer cells automatically with more than 88% accuracy. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

    "Abstract": "Tumor cells metabolize more glucose to lactate in aerobic or hypoxic conditions than normal cells. Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) is crucial for tumor cell aerobic glycolysis. We established a role for let-7a-5p/Stat3/hnRNP-A1/PKM2 signaling in breast cancer cell glucose metabolism. PKM2 depletion via small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) promotes upregulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-A1 expression, hnRNP-A1 binding to pyruvate kinase isoenzyme (PKM) pre messenger RNA, and the subsequent formation of PKM2. This pathway is downregulated by the microRNA let-7a-5p, which functionally targets Stat3, whereas hnRNP-A1 blocks the biogenesis of let-7a-5p to counteract its ability to downregulate the Stat3/hnRNP-A1/PKM2 signaling pathway. The downregulation of Stat3/hnRNP-A1/PKM2 by let-7a-5p is verified using a breast cancer. These results suggest that let-7a-5p, Stat3, and hnRNP-A1 form a feedback loop, thereby regulating PKM2 expression to modulate glucose metabolism of breast cancer cells. These findings elucidate a new pathway mediating aerobic glycolysis in breast cancers and provide an attractive potential target for breast cancer therapeutic intervention. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This paper reports successful synthesis of multifunctional nanoclusters of upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) and gold nanorod (AuNR) through a PEGylation process. UCNPs emit visible luminescence under near-infrared excitation, producing high-contrast images with no background fluorescence. When coupled with AuNRs, the resulting UCNP-AuNR multifunctional nanoclusters are capable of simultaneous detection and treatment of bladder cancer. These UCNP-AuNR nanoclusters are further functionalized with antibodies to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to target bladder cancer cells known to overexpress EGFRs. This paper demonstrates, for the first time, efficient targeting of bladder cancer cells with UCNP-AuNR nanoclusters. In addition to high-contrast imaging and consequently high sensitivity detection of bladder cancer cells, highly selective optoporation-assisted chemotherapy was accomplished using a dosage of chemotherapy agent significantly lower than any previous reports, within a clinically relevant incubation time window. These results are highly relevant to the eventual human application in which the nanoclusters and chemotherapy drugs will be directly instilled in bladder via urinary catheter. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although tobacco involuntary smoking is an established risk factor for lung cancer, the association with head and neck cancer (HNC) is not established. We aimed to investigate this potential association in an East Asian population. Methods: We conducted a multicenter case-control study in East Asia including eight centers. We restricted our analysis to never tobacco smokers (303 cases and 459 controls) and to never tobacco smokers/never alcohol drinkers (243 cases and 403 controls). Results: Among never tobacco smokers, involuntary smoking was associated with a 1.47-fold increase in risk of HNC (95%CI = 1.02, 2.13) and a 1.8-fold increase in the risk of oral cavity cancer (95%CI = 1.14, 2.92). Among never tobacco smokers who were also never alcohol drinkers, increased risks were detected for more than 3 h per day of involuntary smoking exposure and for 15 or more years of exposure. A dose-response relation was suggested for frequency of exposure (p for trend = 0.014) and for years of exposure (p for trend = 0.010) for oral cavity cancer. We did not detect strong increases in the risk of the other HNC subsites. Conclusions: Our study supports the association between involuntary smoking and the risk of HNC. The association may be stronger for oral cavity cancer than for other HNC subsites. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of our study was to validate the sway of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) on the metabolism and growth of bladder cancer cells by microRNA-31 (miR-31)/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Methods: The Gene Expression Omnibus database was used for analyzing the differentially expressed lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) in bladder cancer tissues, with the highly expressed lncRNA PVT1 and mRNA CDK1 screened out. The expression level of PVT1 was detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, cell viability by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, cell proliferation and scratch by 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine assay, cell migration and invasion by transwell assays, the expression level of CDK1 by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis, transcription factor targeting by dual-luciferase assay, and the effect of PVT1 on bladder cancer growth by nude mice tumor formation experiment. Results: LncRNA PVT1 and mRNA CDK1 had a higher expression in bladder cancer cells than that in neighboring tissues. Activity, proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cell were noticeably reduced by the PVT1 inhibitor than that of control group. PVT1 and CDK1 have binding sites with miR-31. When miR-31 decreased, CDK1 mRNA and protein levels increased in vivo experiments in nude mice. When PVT1 was downregulated, the tumor size was significantly reduced and tumor proliferation was curbed. Immunohistochemistry showed that the positive rate of CDK1 and Ki-67 decreased and the expression of miR-31 increased after PVT1 was inhibited. Conclusions: LncRNA PVT1 was overexpressed in bladder cancer cells, and it was downregulated miR-31 to enhance CDK1 expression and facilitate bladder cancer cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The young child's experiences of living with cancer are crucial to providing evidence based care. This study explores and describes experiences of everyday life of young children with cancer, over a three year period from diagnosis. Method: This is a longitudinal, inductive interview study with young children with cancer, and their parents. Interviews from shortly after diagnosis, six and 12 months after diagnosis have been reanalysed. Interviews with the same children and their parents from 18 to 36 months after diagnosis have been analysed for the first time in the present paper. A longitudinal temporal analysis at category level for five synchronic data sets forms the basis for the results. Results: The child living with cancer over a three year period is described as a child apart, striving to live an everyday life. This description is built on three categories: I want to be a child like any other, I need security and control and I feel lonely and left out. Young children with cancer actively strive to understand their illness, participate in care and live an ordinary everyday life- but with ongoing feelings of social isolation and loneliness. Conclusions: Young children with cancer need access to and ongoing contact with peers and preschool. A structured follow-up throughout the cancer trajectory and not just during active treatment, is necessary. A child-centred philosophy of care would guide the child towards attainment of health and wellbeing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: This descriptive study investigated how cancer patient characteristics and utilization of CAM resources, services, and activities at a regional cancer center were associated with patients’ understanding of their health needs, emotional health, and their ability to self-manage their condition. Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire. Sixty-one patients completed a mailed 17-item paper and pencil survey about their sociodemographics, use of CAM offerings, barriers, and perceived benefits. Setting: Mail-based survey completed by cancer patients in a southern state. Main outcome measures: As a result of participating in the center's cancer support services, patients indicated if: (1) they had a better understanding of their health needs; (2) their emotional health has improved; and (3) they take better care of themselves when they are at home and in the community. Results: Participants reported using 0.93 (±1.20) CAM activities (e.g., yoga), 0.62 (±0.71) resources (e.g., the library), and 1.62 (±1.34) services (e.g., monthly support groups), although also reported experiencing 0.74 (±0.81) barriers (e.g., transportation) to accessing these offerings. Perceived benefits were interrelated, where those perceiving CAM offerings to improve their understanding of their health needs also perceived improved emotional health (χ 2 = 27.93, P &lt; 0.001) and better self-care (χ 2 = 30.90, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Greater utilization of CAM offerings was also associated with greater perceived benefits. These results highlight the benefits of CAM therapies for cancer patients’ well-being. Integration of CAM therapies in standard cancer care should be encouraged to complement cancer treatment. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer in women. In the current study, transition metal ruthenium was complexed with flavonoid chrysin to evaluate the chemotherapeutic potential of this compound in Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) human mammary cancer cell line and 7,12-dimethylbenz(α)anthracene-induced mammary cancer in female Sprague–Dawley rats. The characterizations of the complex were accomplished through UV–visible, NMR, IR, Mass spectra, and XRD techniques and antioxidant activity was assessed by DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS methods. In vitro studies included cell viability, cell cycle analysis, DNA fragmentation, and marker analysis by western blot analysis and found that complex treatment suppressed cell growth-induced cell cycle arrest and enhanced the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, complex treatment modulated signaling pathways including mTOR, VEGF, and p53 in the MCF-7 cells. Acute and subacute toxicity was performed in rats to determine the therapeutic doses. Breast cancer in rats was initiated by the administration of 7,12-dimethylbenz(α)anthracene (0.5 mg/100 g body weight) via single tail vein injection. The histopathological analysis after 24 weeks of carcinogenesis study depicted substantial repair of hyperplastic lesions. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed upregulation of Bax and p53 and downregulation of Bcl2 proteins and TUNEL assay showed an increase in apoptotic index in ruthenium–chrysin-treated groups as compared to the carcinogen control. Our findings from the in vitro and in vivo study support the continued investigation of ruthenium–chrysin complex possesses a potential chemotherapeutic activity against breast cancer and was efficient in reducing hyperplastic lesions in the mammary tissues of rats by inducing apoptosis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Coffee inhibits the progression of prostate cancer; however, the direct mechanism through which coffee acts on prostate cancer cells remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the key compounds of coffee that possess anti-cancer effects and to investigate their mechanisms of action. Methods: The anti-proliferation and anti-migration effects of six potentially active types of coffee compounds, including kahweol acetate, cafestol, caffeine, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and trigonelline hydrochloride, were evaluated using LNCaP, LNCaP-SF, PC-3, and DU145 human prostate cancer cells. The synergistic effects of these compounds were also investigated. Apoptosis-related and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins, androgen receptor in whole cell and in nucleus, and chemokines were assessed. A xenograft study of SCID mice was performed to examine the in vivo effect of coffee compounds. Results: Among the evaluated compounds, only kahweol acetate and cafestol inhibited the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The combination treatment involving kahweol acetate and cafestol synergistically inhibited proliferation and migration (combination index <1) with the induction of apoptosis, the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and decrease in androgen receptor, resulting in the reduction of nuclear androgen receptor in androgen receptor-positive cells. Moreover, kahweol acetate and cafestol downregulated CCR2 and CCR5 without an increase in their ligands, CCL2 and CCL5. The xenograft study showed that oral administration of kahweol acetate and cafestol significantly inhibited tumor growth. Conclusion: Kahweol acetate and cafestol synergistically inhibit the progression of prostate cancer. These coffee compounds may be novel therapeutic candidates for prostate cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To prospectively follow-up and investigate women's perceptions of the cosmetic outcome of their implant-based breast reconstruction, body image, sexuality, anxiety/depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 6–20 years after bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM), or complementary RRM after breast cancer diagnosis, due to increased risk of hereditary breast cancer. Patients and methods: Women with and without previous breast cancer diagnosis that underwent RRM between March 1997 and September 2010 were invited (n = 200). We compared 146 (73%) sets of long-term questionnaire responses (e.g., EORTC QLQ-BRR26, Body Image Scale, Sexuality Activity Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and SF-36) with responses one year after surgery. Women with and without previous breast cancer were compared at the long-term assessment point. Results: The HRQoL and anxiety/depressive symptoms remained unchanged compared with one year after surgery, and there were no between-group differences. The negative impact on body image persisted in both groups for most of the items. 'sexual discomfort’ increased significantly for women with previous breast cancer (p = 0.016). Women with previous breast cancer also reported more problems with ‘Disease treatment/surgery related symptoms’ (p = 0.006) and 'sexuality’ (p = 0.031) in the EORTC QLQ-BRR26 questionnaire. Conclusion: Problems with body image appeared to persist long time post-RRM. No differences in HRQoL were found at the long-term follow-up between women with and without previous breast cancer. The results of this investigation might be of use in improving future counselling before risk-reducing surgery for women in the decision-making process. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background Prostate cancer is an extremely common disease in males, and the mortality of prostate cancer has been rising year by year. Sinomenine has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor effect on various cancers, but the function of Sinomenine in prostate cancer remains unclear. The study aimed to explore the effect of Sinomenine on proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Methods PC3 cells were stimulated by different concentrations of Sinomenine, then cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were examined by CCK-8, BrdU, Transwell and flow cytometry, respectively. Subsequently, miR-23a mimic and miR-23a inhibitor were transfected into PC3 and LNCaP cells, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were reassessed in these transfected cells. The related factors of cell cycle, apoptosis, metastasis and PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signal pathways were measured by western blot. Results Sinomenine significantly suppressed cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis and inhibited migration and invasion, as well as down-regulated Cyclin D1, CDK4, Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, Vimentin protein levels and up-regulated p16 and Bax protein levels in PC3 cells. Additionally, Sinomenine decreased the expression level of miR-23a, and overexpression of miR-23a reversed the effects of Sinomenine on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in PC3 and LNCaP cells. Further, Sinomenine inactivated PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signal pathways by regulation of miR-23a. Conclusions The data suggested that Sinomenine could suppress cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promote apoptosis of prostate cancer cells through regulation of miR-23a. These findings might provide a possible strategy for the clinical treatment of prostate cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "3w?&gt;Studies investigating the association of Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence with pancreatic cancer risk are limited and had inconsistent results. We examined the association between MD adherence and pancreatic cancer incidence by pooling data from the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS, 120,852 subjects) and the Dutch cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-NL, 40,011 subjects). MD adherence was assessed using alternate and modified Mediterranean diet scores (aMED and mMED, respectively), including and excluding alcohol. After median follow-ups of 20.3 (NLCS) and 19.2 (EPIC-NL) years, 449 microscopically confirmed pancreatic cancer (MCPC) cases were included in study-specific multivariable Cox models. Study-specific estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. MD adherence was not significantly associated with MCPC risk in pooled and study-specific analyses, regardless of sex and MD score. Pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for high (6–8) compared to low (0–3) values of mMED excluding alcohol were 0.66 (0.40–1.10) in men and 0.94 (0.63–1.40) in women. In never smokers, mMED excluding alcohol seemed to be inversely associated with MCPC risk (nonsignificant). However, no association was observed in ever smokers (pheterogeneity = 0.03). Hazard ratios were consistent across strata of other potential effect modifiers. Considering MD scores excluding alcohol, mMED-containing models generally fitted better than aMED-containing models, particularly in men. Although associations somewhat differed when all pancreatic cancers were considered instead of MCPC, the overall conclusion was similar. In conclusion, MD adherence was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk in a pooled analysis of two Dutch cohorts. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "The identity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains an enigma, with the question outstanding of whether CSCs are fixed entities or plastic cell states in response to microenvironmental cues. Recent evidence highlights the power of the tumor microenvironment to dictate CSC functionality and spatiotemporal regulation that gives rise to tumor heterogeneity. This microenvironmental regulation of CSCs parallels that of normal tissues, whereby resident stem cells reside within specialized microenvironments or ‘niches’, which provide the cellular and molecular signals that wire every aspect of stem cell behavior and fate. The extracellular matrix (ECM), along with its sequestered growth factors, is a fundamental component of the stem cell niche. Pathological ECM remodeling is an established hallmark of cancer, with the ECM a key mediator of metastasis and drug resistance. In this review, we discuss the controversial identity of CSCs and new understanding of the impact of tumor microenvironment on CSC function and phenotype. We outline parallels between development, wound repair and cancer to discuss how changes in ECM dynamics influence stem cell function during normal physiological processes and pathological states, as well as the transition between the two in the form of precancerous lesions. We then explore examples illustrating the molecular circuits partnering cancer cells with stromal cells and how this communication involving ECM imparts a CSC phenotype and promotes chemoresistance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CSC functionality and chemoresistance, along with mathematical modeling approaches and advancing technologies for targeting the undruggable proteome, should open opportunities for cancer breakthroughs in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer diagnosis in women, with triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-enriched advanced breast cancers having the poorest prognoses. The morbidity and mortality associated with advanced disease, as well as the emergence of multi-drug resistant variants, highlights the urgency to develop novel therapeutic agents. Artesunate (ART) is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin from the Chinese herb sweet wormwood. ART is widely used in the treatment of malaria and is well tolerated by patients. Importantly, ART also has anti-cancer activities and may therefore represent a less toxic alternative to conventional chemotherapy. In this study, we demonstrate a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of ART on the growth of triple-negative MDA-MB-468 and HER2-enriched SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, which was the result of both anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activities. ART inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent G2/M arrest and ROS-independent G1 arrest. ART-treated MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 cells also experienced apoptotic cell death, which was both ROS- and iron-dependent. ART-induced oxidative stress caused the loss of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity and damage to the cellular DNA of MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 cells. In addition, exposure to low-dose ART sensitized MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that ART may have clinical utility in the treatment of triple-negative and HER2-enriched breast cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC) is among the most malignant lung cancers worldwide, lacking biomarkers for diagnostic and targets for treatment. In this study, we observed that miR-140-3p was expressed at low levels both in SqCLC cell lines and patient samples, while overexpression of miR-140-3p dramatically reduced the cell proliferation and invasion in SqCLC cells and Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Our further investigation indicated miR-140-3p negatively affected the tumorigenesis of SqCLC by down-regulating the expression of BRD9, an oncogene in SqCLC. Inhibition of BRD9 repressed SqCLC tumorigenesis by regulating c-myc expression. Meanwhile, BRD9 expression is up-regulated and negatively correlated with miR-140-3p in clinical samples; a meta-analysis of survival data indicates that SqCLC patients with high levels of BRD9 in their tumors have a worse prognosis. Collectively, our study suggests the prognostic and therapeutic roles of miR-140-3p and BRD9 axis in squamous cell lung cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune response and the progression of cervical lesions. There is a growing body of data evaluating the value of a genetic variant in the TNFa gene with the risk of developing cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the association of a variant, TNF-308 G>A, residing in the TNFa gene with cervical cancer. A total of 91 women with cervical cancer and 161 women as the control group were recruited. DNA was extracted, and Taqman®-probes-based assay was used for genotyping. Our results showed that the minor allele frequency was 0.3 in total population, and the frequency of minor allele A was more in the case group compared with the control. The regression models in different genetic models also revealed that the allele A is a potential risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. In particular, in the dominant model, patients with AG and AA genotypes had a higher risk of developing cervical cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 2.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57-4.83, <0.001) and OR of 7.27 (95%CI: 2.5-20.8, <0.001), compared with the GG genotype. Moreover, a similar outcome was obtained for smear test results. Our study demonstrated that TNF-308 G>A located on TNF-a was associated with the risk of cervical cancer, supporting further studies in a larger population and multicenter setting to show the value of emerging markers as risk stratification biomarkers in cervical cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: There is growing evidence that optimal post-resuscitation treatment is a significant factor for overall survival and neurological outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, there is also growing evidence of disparities in treatments in vulnerable populations such as elderly individuals or patients with underlying diseases, including cancer. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of cancer status on post-resuscitation therapies among OHCA patients. Material and methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study based on a nationwide prospective OHCA registry database of Korea. All adult OHCA patients with presumed cardiac etiology and sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from 2009 to 2016 were included in this study. Main exposure was history of cancer and primary outcome was post-resuscitation care, including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and targeted temperature management (TTM). Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the association between cancer and post-resuscitation treatments. Results: A total of 33,760 patients were included for final analysis. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that cancer patients were significantly less likely to receive PCI and TTM compared to those without history of cancer with adjusted odds ratios of 0.29 (95% CI: 0.24–0.37) and 0.66 (0.58–0.77), respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that a prior history of cancer may be associated with lower probability to receive potentially beneficial post-resuscitation treatments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Photodynamic treatment is a minimally invasive and clinically approved procedure for eliminating selected malignant cells with activation of a photosensitizer agent at a specific light. Little is known, however, about the phototoxic properties of curcumin, as a natural phenolic compound, against different types of cancers. It is generally accepted that cellular damage occurs during photo treatment. There is a limitation in using of curcumin as a drug due to its low solubility, but nanoparticles such as anionic nanoclays or layered double hydroxide (LDH) could overcome it. The aim of this study was to investigate cellular responses to curcumin-LDH nanoparticles after photodynamic treatment of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. For this purpose, the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line treated with curcumin-LDH nanoparticle and then irradiated (photodynamic treatment). After irradiation, lactate dehydrogenase assay, clonogenic cell survival, cell death mechanisms such as autophagy and apoptosis were determined. Cell cycle distribution after photodynamic therapy (PDT) and also intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were measured. The result showed that curcumin-LDH–PDT has a cytotoxic and antiprolifrative effect on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Curcumin-LDH–PDT induced autophagy, apoptosis, and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cell line. Intracellular ROS increased in MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line after treatment with curcumin-LDH along with irradiation. The results suggest that curcumin-LDH nanoparticle could be considered as a novel approach in the photodynamic treatment of breast cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer recurrence and cancer related mortality in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). EGFR overexpression is in 50–75% TNBC and EGFR-mediated signaling has potential as an attractive therapeutic target in some specific subtypes of breast cancer due to its significant association with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. Therefore, identification of promising therapeutic strategies targeting EGFR with higher specificity toward cancer metastasis is urgently needed. 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD), one of the major active metabolites from Panax ginseng, has been widely reported to possess pleiotropic anticancer activities in various cancers. In this study, we investigated the effect of PPD against cancer metastasis and the related molecular mechanisms in TNBC in vitro and in vivo. PPD (>30 μM) suppressed cell proliferation by arresting cell cycle in G0/1 phase and triggering cells apoptosis as shown by cell viability assay, flow cytometry analysis and colony formation assay, whereas lower dose of PPD (<20 μM) decreased metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells through direct inhibition of cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness. In TNBC xenograft and syngeneic models, PPD treatment markedly decreased tumor growth and lung metastasis. PPD reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), decreased the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) while increased the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) as shown by Western blot and gelatin zymography. Cell signaling pathways that control the expression or activation of these processes were investigated by Western blot and ELISA assay. PPD treatment reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR and down-regulated the activation ERK1/2, p38 and JNK signaling, which was further validated by using the agonists or inhibitors of EGFR and MAP kinases family. Collectively, these findings suggest that PPD holds therapeutic potential against the tumor metastasis of TNBC via targeting EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nearly 1.5 million clinicians in the United States will be affected by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) new payment program, the Merit-based Incentive Program (MIPS), where clinicians will be penalized or rewarded based on the health care expenditures of their patients. We therefore examined expenditures for major cancer surgery to understand physician-specific variation in episode payments. Methods: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results–Medicare data to identify patients aged 66–99 y who underwent a prostatectomy, nephrectomy, lung, or colorectal resection for cancer from 2008 to 2012. We calculated 90-d episode payments, attributed each episode to a physician, and evaluated physician-level payment variation. Next, we determined which component (index admission, readmission, physician services, postacute care, hospice) drove differences in payments. Finally, we evaluated payments by geographic region, number of comorbidities, and cancer stage. Results: We identified 39,109 patients who underwent surgery by 1 of 7182 providers. There was wide variation in payments for each procedure (prostatectomy: $7046–$40,687; nephrectomy: $8855–$82,489; lung resection: $11,167–$223,467; colorectal resection: $9711–$199,480). The largest component difference in episode payments varied by condition: physician payments for prostatectomy (29%), postacute care for nephrectomy (38%) and colorectal resections (38%), and index hospital admission for lung resections (43%) but were fairly stable across region, comorbidity number, and cancer stage. Conclusions: For patients undergoing major cancer surgery, 90-d episode payments vary widely across surgeons. The components driving such variation differ by condition but remain stable across region, number of comorbidities, and cancer stage. These data suggest that programs to reduce specific component payments may have advantages over those targeting individual physicians for decreasing health care expenditures. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Recent decades have seen improvements in UK breast cancer services and treatments. Despite this, it is recognised that a range of patients’ psychological and emotional needs remain unmet, both at the time of treatment and into survivorship. Using data from two distinct cohorts of women: those treated with radiotherapy for breast cancer historically, and women treated more recently, this study sought to identify and explore those needs and concerns that have continued to persist, despite advances in treatment and care. Method: Data from N = 13 semi-structured interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. An heuristic framework was applied to extract themes common to both participant cohorts. Results: Participants’ data evidenced an enduring vulnerability amongst cancer patients that has not diminished with new treatment pathways. Themes common to both cohorts highlighted the ongoing importance of personal factors such as resilience, and strategies to help retain a sense of normality. Extrinsic support was important too, especially high quality communication by healthcare professionals and having access to ongoing emotional support from others, particularly when active treatment ends. Participants’ suggestions for future service development included the provision of ongoing continuity of care and greater access to emotional support services. Conclusions: This study highlights the psychological needs and concerns of breast cancer patients that have persisted, despite the many advances in patient-centred care. Findings are of value to nurses and other healthcare professionals in highlighting the ongoing importance of recognising, acknowledging and addressing patients’ concerns and needs, even within current cancer care pathways. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: The current investigation examined the association between chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in breast cancer survivors. Methods: A case-cohort study was conducted, based on 2165 female breast cancer survivors recruited from “Leumit” healthcare fund, who were diagnosed with primary nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer between 2002 and 2012. A 20% random subcohort was sampled at baseline, and all CVD cases were identified. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Of 2165 breast cancer survivors, 466 developed CVD over a mean follow-up of 5.7 years. The crude cumulative incidence of CVD accounting for death as a competing risk was 33.6% (95% CI, 29.6–37.6%) at 13 years of follow-up. Lifestyle components, collected post-CVD incidence, indicated a higher prevalence of poor nutrition and physical inactivity in CVD patients. In multivariable analyses, CVD was positively associated with radiotherapy without chemotherapy compared to no radiotherapy or chemotherapy (HR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.17–7.38; p =.022), outpatient visits (HR per average 10-annual visits, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.50–2.31; p <.001), employment transition between breast cancer diagnosis and treatment: job loss versus no change (HR, 29.62; 95% CI, 12.72–68.97; p <.001), and inversely associated with education (HR per 1-year increment, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.94; p =.003). Conclusions: Radiotherapy administered as an adjuvant treatment for breast cancer elevates the risk of CVD. Preventive strategies should be directed to surveillance for radiotherapy-related CVD dysfunction. Efforts should also address lifestyle modifications and occupational rehabilitation in patients at a high risk of CVD. © 2018 Japanese College of Cardiology",

    "Abstract": "In past few years, cancer specific targeted drug formulations have shown some hope of improving the therapeutics with minimized associated side effects of chemotherapy. However, the benefits has proven modest due to lack of systems that can be assessed easily from parent drugs while maintaining the same features of cancer associated prodrug activation. We developed a small molecule-based, carboxylesterase responsive theranostic, EDOX, with tumor-specific enzymatic activation for targeted delivery of the anticancer drug, Doxorubicin (Dox), to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Easy synthetic access, physiological stability, tumor-selective activation, and sustained drug release make EDOX an excellent candidate for use as a next-generation drug delivery system for HCC. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The main objective of this study was to develop an effective in-gel trypsin digestion protocol using aqueous-acetonitrile solvent system to facilitate MS analysis and maximize the number of identified proteins from biological samples. The procedure, where 80% acetonitrile was present in the trypsin reaction mixture, increased the number of matched peptides, and allowed the identification of more proteins with higher coverage than the common digestion protocol. Vimentin, annexins, tubulin, actin, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase or alpha-enolase are examples of important proteins that change during the progress cancer. These were isolated from human breast cancer cells and were used for this study. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Nuclear receptor coactivator 5 (NCOA5) specifically enhances estrogen receptor α–modulated transcriptional activity. As a novel tumor suppressor, depletion of NCOA5 is associated with the development of a variety of tumors, but its function in cervical cancer is currently unclear. In this study, we addressed how expression of NCOA5 changed in the development of human cervical cancer and its association with clinicopathological features, prognosis, and biology characteristics of cervical cancer. Analysis of the microarrays in the Oncomine database indicated that NCOA5 expression was lower in human cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissues than that in normal cervical tissues. That was corroborated by our experiments using fresh tissues: the expression levels of NCOA5 messenger RNA and protein were both significantly decreased in cervical cancer tissues compared with paired adjacent nontumor tissues (P < 0.01). Low expression of NCOA5 is associated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (P = 0.043) and histological grade (P = 0.018) of human cervical cancer. In addition, patients possessing low NCOA5 expression had poorer prognosis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that low NCOA5 expression may be an independent prognostic factor for poorer overall survival in cervical cancer. Further, downregulation of NCOA5 expression results in a significant increase in proliferation, migration, and invasion of HeLa cells. Data of xenograft tumor on BALB/c nude mice manifested that HeLa cells with low NCOA5 expression tend to form larger tumors than negative control ones. In contrast, overexpression of NCOA5 expression leads to the opposite results. Finally, we found that NCOA5 might affect the biological function of human cervical cancer cells by mediating the notch3 signaling pathway. These findings suggest that NCOA5 acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit tumorigenicity, migration, and invasion, and thus represents a potential novel prognostic marker for overall survival in cervical cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In addition, 71 primary cervical cancer tissues and matched adjacent nontumor specimen were obtained immediately after surgical resection from patients in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, from January 2016 to December 2017. All of the specimens were pathologically diagnosed with cervical cancer by three pathologists. None of the participants from whom the samples were obtained had received preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. All the paraffin‐embedded samples possessed intact follow‐ up information. The mean age of the 93 patients was 46.6 ± 9.9 years with a median follow‐up time of 60 months (ranged from 7‐60 months). Clinical stage was classified in accordance with criteria of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Seventy‐one paired fresh cervix tumor tissues and matched adjacent nontumor tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen before use. This study was examined and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Qilu Hospital (KYLL‐2017‐ 148). Written informed consents were obtained from all the participants involved in this study before surgery.",
