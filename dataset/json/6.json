    "Abstract": "Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely involved in the initiation and development of cancer. Although some computational methods have been proposed to identify cancer-related lncRNAs, there is still a demanding to improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the quick-update data of cancer, as well as the discovery of new mechanism, also underlay the possibility of improvement of cancer-related lncRNA prediction algorithm. In this study, we introduced CRlncRC, a novel Cancer-Related lncRNA Classifier by integrating manifold features with five machine-learning techniques. Results: CRlncRC was built on the integration of genomic, expression, epigenetic and network, totally in four categories of features. Five learning techniques were exploited to develop the effective classification model including Random Forest (RF), Naïve bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Using ten-fold cross-validation, we showed that RF is the best model for classifying cancer-related lncRNAs (AUC = 0.82). The feature importance analysis indicated that epigenetic and network features play key roles in the classification. In addition, compared with other existing classifiers, CRlncRC exhibited a better performance both in sensitivity and specificity. We further applied CRlncRC to lncRNAs from the TANRIC (The Atlas of non-coding RNA in Cancer) dataset, and identified 121 cancer-related lncRNA candidates. These potential cancer-related lncRNAs showed a certain kind of cancer-related indications, and many of them could find convincing literature supports. Conclusions: Our results indicate that CRlncRC is a powerful method for identifying cancer-related lncRNAs. Machine-learning-based integration of multiple features, especially epigenetic and network features, had a great contribution to the cancer-related lncRNA prediction. RF outperforms other learning techniques on measurement of model sensitivity and specificity. In addition, using CRlncRC method, we predicted a set of cancer-related lncRNAs, all of which displayed a strong relevance to cancer as a valuable conception for the further cancer-related lncRNA function studies. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Recent studies demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could be intricately implicated in cancer-related molecular networks, and related to cancer occurrence, development and prognosis. However, clinicopathological and molecular features for these cancer-related lncRNAs, which are very important in bridging lncRNA basic research with clinical research, fail to well settle to integration. Results: After manually reviewing more than 2500 published literature, we collected the cancer-related lncRNAs with the experimental proof of functions. By integrating from literature and public databases, we constructed CRlncRNA, a database of cancer-related lncRNAs. The current version of CRlncRNA embodied 355 entries of cancer-related lncRNAs, covering 1072 cancer-lncRNA associations regarding to 76 types of cancer, and 1238 interactions with different RNAs and proteins. We further annotated clinicopathological features of these lncRNAs, such as the clinical stages and the cancer hallmarks. We also provided tools for data browsing, searching and download, as well as online BLAST, genome browser and gene network visualization service. Conclusions: CRlncRNA is a manually curated database for retrieving clinicopathological and molecular features of cancer-related lncRNAs supported by highly reliable evidences. CRlncRNA aims to provide a bridge from lncRNA basic research to clinical research. The lncRNA dataset collected by CRlncRNA can be used as a golden standard dataset for the prospective experimental and in-silico studies of cancer-related lncRNAs.

    "Abstract": "Mitochondria play pivotal roles in most eukaryotic cells, ranging from energy production to regulation of apoptosis. As sites of cellular respiration, mitochondria experience accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to damage in electron transport chain carriers. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as nuclear DNA are reported in various cancers. Mitochondria have a dual role in cancer: the development of tumors due to mutations in mitochondrial genome and the generation of ROS. Impairment in the mitochondria-regulated apoptosis pathway accelerates tumorigenesis. Numerous strategies targeting mitochondria have been developed to induce the mitochondrial (i.e. intrinsic) apoptosis pathway in cancer cells. This review elaborates the roles of mitochondria in cancer with respect to mutations and apoptosis and discusses mitochondria-targeting strategies as cancer therapies to enhance the killing of cancer cells.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Identification of cancer subtypes is of great importance to facilitate cancer diagnosis and therapy. A number of methods have been proposed to integrate multi-sources data to identify cancer subtypes in recent years. However, few of them consider the regulatory associations between genome features and the contribution weights of different data-views in data integration. It is widely accepted that the regulatory associations between features play important roles in cancer subtype studies. In addition, different data-views may have different contributions in data integration for cancer subtype prediction. Results: In this paper, we propose a method, CSPRV, to improve the cancer subtype prediction by incorporating multi-sources transcriptome expression data and heterogeneous biological networks. We extract multiple expression features of each genome element based on the regulatory associations in the heterogeneous biological networks and use a generalized matrix correlation method (RV 2) to predict the similarities between samples in each view of expression data. We fuse the similarity information in multiple data-views according to different integration weights. Based on the integrated similarities between samples, we cluster samples into different subtype groups. Comprehensive experiments on TCGA cancer datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can identify more clinically meaningful cancer subtypes comparing with most existing methods. Conclusions: The consideration of regulatory associations between biological features and data-views contribution is important to improve the understanding of cancer subtypes. The proposed method provides an open framework to incorporate transcriptome expression data and biological regulation network to predict cancer subtypes. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gene expression-based profiling has been used to identify biomarkers for different breast cancer subtypes. However, this technique has many limitations. IsomiRs are isoforms of miRNAs that have critical roles in many biological processes and have been successfully used to distinguish various cancer types. Biomarker isomiRs for identifying different breast cancer subtypes has not been investigated. For the first time, we aim to show that isomiRs are better performing biomarkers and use them to explain molecular differences between breast cancer subtypes. Results: In this study, a novel method is proposed to identify specific isomiRs that faithfully classify breast cancer subtypes. First, as a null hypothesis method we removed the lowly expressed isomiRs from small sequencing data generated from diverse breast cancers types. Second, we developed an improved mutual information-based feature selection method to calculate the weight of each isomiR expression. The weight of isomiR measures the importance of a given isomiR in classifying breast cancer subtypes. The improved mutual information enables to apply the dataset in which the feature is continuous data and label is discrete data; whereby, the traditional mutual information cannot be applied in this dataset. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is applied to find isomiR biomarkers for subtyping. Conclusions: Here we demonstrate that isomiRs can be used as biomarkers in the identification of different breast cancer subtypes, and in addition, they may provide new insights into the diverse molecular mechanisms of breast cancers. We have also shown that the classification of different subtypes of breast cancer based on isomiRs expression is more effective than using published gene expression profiling. The proposed method provides a better performance outcome than Fisher method and Hellinger method for discovering biomarkers to distinguish different breast cancer subtypes. This novel technique could be directly applied to identify biomarkers in other diseases. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Human cancers are complex ecosystems composed of cells with distinct molecular signatures. Such intratumoral heterogeneity poses a major challenge to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements of single-cell techniques such as scRNA-seq have brought unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity. Subsequently, a challenging computational problem is to cluster high dimensional noisy datasets with substantially fewer cells than the number of genes. Methods: In this paper, we introduced a consensus clustering framework conCluster, for cancer subtype identification from single-cell RNA-seq data. Using an ensemble strategy, conCluster fuses multiple basic partitions to consensus clusters. Results: Applied to real cancer scRNA-seq datasets, conCluster can more accurately detect cancer subtypes than the widely used scRNA-seq clustering methods. Further, we conducted co-expression network analysis for the identified melanoma subtypes. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that these subtypes exhibit distinct gene co-expression networks and significant gene sets with different functional enrichment. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is consistently associated with prostate cancer risk. IGF-1 binds to IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) and insulin receptor (IR), activating cancer hallmark pathways. Experimental evidence suggests that TMPRSS2:ERG may interact with IGF/insulin signaling to influence progression. We investigated IGF1R and IR expression and its association with lethal prostate cancer among 769 men. Protein expression of IGF1R, IR and ERG (i.e. a surrogate of ERG fusion genes) were assayed by immunohistochemistry. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for clinical characteristics. Among patients, 29% had strong tumor IGF1R expression and 10% had strong IR expression. During a mean follow-up of 13.2 years through 2012, 80 men (11%) developed lethal disease. Tumors with strong IGF1R or IR expression showed increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis and a higher prevalence of ERG. In multivariable models, strong IGF1R was associated with a borderline increased risk of lethal prostate cancer (HR 1.7; 95% CI 0.9-3.1). The association appeared greater in ERG-positive tumors (HR 2.8; 95% CI 0.9-8.4) than in ERG-negative tumors (HR 1.3; 95% CI 0.6-3.0, p-heterogeneity 0.08). There was no association between IR and lethal prostate cancer (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.4-1.9). These results suggest that tumor IGF1R expression may play a role in prostate cancer progression to a lethal phenotype and that ERG-positive tumors may be more sensitive to IGF signaling. These data may improve our understanding of IGF signaling in prostate cancer and suggest therapeutic options for disease subtypes.",

    "Abstract": "The dysregulation of micro RNAs (miRNAs) is a crucial characteristic of human cancers. Herein, we observed frequent amplification of the MIR191/425 locus in breast cancer, which is correlated with poor survival outcome. We demonstrated that the miR-191/425 cluster binds the 3' untranslated region of the DICER1 transcript and posttranscriptionally represses DICER1 expression, thereby impairing global miRNAs biogenesis. Functionally, the forced expression of miR-191 or miR-425 stimulated the proliferation, survival, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, whereas the inhibition of miR-191 or miR-425 suppressed these oncogenic behaviors of breast cancer cells, in a manner dependent on miR-191/425-mediated downregulation of DICER1. Furthermore, the miR-191/425 cluster promoted breast tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in vivo. The let-7 family of miRNAs was downregulated upon forced expression of miR-191 or miR-425, with a corresponding increase in the levels of let-7 target, high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2). The forced expression of let-7 partially abrogated the miR-191/425-mediated oncogenic effects in breast cancer cells, suggestive of let-7 as a downstream effector of the miR-191/425-DICER1 axis. Collectively, we proposed that the inhibition of global miRNA processing, through miR-191/425-mediated downregulation of DICER1, promotes breast cancer progression.",

    "Abstract": "Bladder cancer (BC) is a common malignancy, and it accounts for one of the highest management costs among urogenital cancers. As a non-invasive method, urine cytology plays an important role in the detection of exfoliated tumor cells (ETCs) for early diagnosis of BC. However, urine cytology suffers from its low sensitivity and reliance on microscopic examination. To address this issue, an integrated filtration device was developed with a pore size of 5 μm that isolated and enriched ETCs from discarded urine samples, and then quantified ETCs using a microchip ELISA method. The results revealed that the number of urinary ETCs from BC patients (n = 35) was obviously higher than the number of ETCs from healthy donors (n = 20). The ROC curve showed that the integrated filtration microfluidic device had a sensitivity of 77.1% when the specificity was set at 90% in identifying BC patients. Thus, the integrated filtration device holds great potential for the screening of BC or the follow-up analysis of treatment efficacy in point-of-care (POC) settings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "High frequency of mortality in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is vastly associated with the invasive and metastatic nature of these cancer cells. Little is known about the factors involved in this invasive/metastatic process. The current challenge in the treatment of these patients is the lack of viable options besides gemcitabine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of PDZ-binding kinase (PBK)/T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) in invasive PDAC cells and to determine whether PBK/TOPK expression drives invasiveness in PDAC. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in established and patient-derived xenograft-PDAC cell lines, and examining patient-derived archival tissue samples, we demonstrate for the first time that PBK/TOPK is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and expression levels are closely associated with the invasive property of pancreatic cancer cells. Modulation of PBK/TOPK causally regulates the invasive ability of PDAC cells. We also demonstrate that two key players in metastatic invasion, matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 gelatinase activity and gene promoter activities, are regulated by PBK/TOPK. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that PBK/TOPK provides stability of an oncoprotein, c-MYC, which transcriptionally regulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 in these invasive PDAC cells. Our in vitro and in situ data corroborate that PBK/TOPK is closely associated with the invasive nature of PDAC and reveal a novel mechanism by which the metastatic behavior of human pancreatic cancer cells is regulated. These findings provide a rationale for targeting PBK/TOPK for the therapeutic intervention of invasive/metastatic pancreatic cancer in human.",

    "Abstract": "Kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6) is a serine protease that is aberrantly altered in various types of cancer, but its role in non-melanoma skin cancer has not been investigated. KLK6 is active in epidermis and has been linked to normal skin differentiation. Thus, we investigated whether it could be implicated in skin tumorigenesis in vivo. Carcinogenesis was induced in Klk6-/- mice by epidermal application of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (DMBA/TPA), and multistage skin tumor development and progression was monitored closely until squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and invasive tumors formed. Klk6-/- (but also Klk6+/-) mice were highly resistant to tumor growth/development manifested by their highly diminished numbers and delayed onset of tumors compared with wild-type (wt) mice. Histological analyses of the few tumors that developed in Klk6-/- after prolonged (>1 year) chemical challenge revealed that these were mainly benign papillomas, whereas in wt mice tumors progressed to SCCs. Inflammation was attenuated in Klk6-/- skin following chronic exposure to TPA, indicated by markedly low expression of proinflammatory cytokines, in direct contrast to wt. Further, in Klk6-/- mice, the ability of implanted nascent PDVC57 skin cancer cells to form tumors was highly diminished. Our study identified KLK6 as a new tumor-promoting factor of early skin cancer and suggested that KLK6 is an important molecular link in the development of skin inflammation and in tumor-promoting inflammatory processes.",

    "Abstract": "Interleukin 35 (IL-35) is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine, consisting of an Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) subunit and a p35 subunit. IL-35 is mainly produced by regulatory T and regulatory B cells, and plays a crucial role in the development and prevention of infectious and autoimmune diseases. However, the effect of IL-35 in malignant disease is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that breast cancer cells (BCCs) also expressed and secreted IL-35 and higher level of IL-35 in BCCs was closely associated with poor prognosis of patients and was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for breast cancer. Subsequent study revealed that BCC-derived IL-35 inhibited conventional T (Tconv) cell proliferation and further induced suppressed Tconv cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T (iTr35) cells. Furthermore, BCC-derived IL-35 promoted the secretion of inhibitory cytokine IL-10 and obviously decreased the secretion of Th1-type cytokine IFN-γ and Th17-type cytokine IL-17 in Tconv cells. Meanwhile, the expression of inhibitory receptor CD73 was also elevated on the surface of Tconv cells following the BCCs' supernatant treatment. Mechanistically, BCC-derived IL-35 exhausted Tconv cells and induced iTr35 by activating transcription factor STAT1/STAT3. Hence, our results indicate functions of BCC-derived IL-35 in promoting tumor progression through proliferation inhibition of tumor-infiltrating Tconv cells and induction of iTr35 cells in tumor microenvironment. This study highlights that IL-35 produced by BCCs are a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Evidences have increasingly indicated that lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are deeply involved in important biological regulation processes leading to various human complex diseases. Experimental investigations of these disease associated lncRNAs are slow with high costs. Computational methods to infer potential associations between lncRNAs and diseases have become an effective prior-pinpointing approach to the experimental verification. Results: In this study, we develop a novel method for the prediction of lncRNA-disease associations using bi-random walks on a network merging the similarities of lncRNAs and diseases. Particularly, this method applies a Laplacian technique to normalize the lncRNA similarity matrix and the disease similarity matrix before the construction of the lncRNA similarity network and disease similarity network. The two networks are then connected via existing lncRNA-disease associations. After that, bi-random walks are applied on the heterogeneous network to predict the potential associations between the lncRNAs and the diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method is highly comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods for predicting lncRNA-disease associations. Our analyses on three cancer data sets (breast cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer) also indicate the usefulness of our method in practical applications. Conclusions: Our proposed method, including the construction of the lncRNA similarity network and disease similarity network and the bi-random walks algorithm on the heterogeneous network, could be used for prediction of potential associations between the lncRNAs and the diseases. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "IκB, a cytoplasmic inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), is reportedly degraded via the proteasome. However, we recently found that long-term incubation with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as PS-341 or MG132 induces IκBα degradation via an alternative pathway, lysosome, which results in NF-κB activation and confers resistance to PI-induced lung cancer cell death. To enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of PIs, elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of PI-induced IκBα degradation is necessary. Here, we demonstrated that PI upregulates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) via both de novo protein synthesis and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) degradation, which is responsible for IκBα degradation via macroautophagy activation. PIs increased the protein level of light chain 3B (LC3B, macroautophagy marker), but not lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a (Lamp2a, the receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy) in NCI-H157 and A549 lung cancer cells. Pretreatment with macroautophagy inhibitor or knock-down of LC3B blocked PI-induced IκBα degradation. PIs up-regulated Nrf2 by increasing its transcription and mediating degradation of KEAP1 (cytoplasmic inhibitor of Nrf2). Overexpression of dominant-negative Nrf2, which lacks an N-terminal transactivating domain, or knock-down of Nrf2 suppressed PI-induced LC3B protein expression and subsequent IκBα degradation. Thus, blocking of the Nrf2 pathway enhanced PI-induced cell death. These findings suggest that Nrf2-driven induction of LC3B plays an essential role in PI-induced activation of the IκB/NF-κB pathway, which attenuates the anti-tumor efficacy of PIs.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, self-assembled nanostructure of casein (NS CS ) of spherical shape was prepared using an optimized desolvation method with a mean size of 45 nm. Curcumin (Cur), a potent natural antioxidant, an anticancer and poorly soluble agent in aqueous solution, was conjugated to protein nanostructure (NS CS -Cur) using CDI chemical activation method. We further, evaluated the physicochemical stability as well as the biological activity of NS CS -Cur in vitro. When the antioxidant activity (free radical scavenging activity) and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assay of nano-formulated curcumin (NS CS -Cur) was evaluated, it revealed that antioxidant activity of NS CS -Cur was higher than that of free Cur in both. Furthermore, we showed that the cytotoxicity of nano-formulated curcumin (NS CS -Cur) was found higher in four different cancer cells (breast cancer; MCF-7 and MDAMB231, cervical cancer; HeLa, osteosarcoma; MG 63) than that of free curcumin. Moreover, the conjugation with folic acid with NS CS -Cur (NS CS -Cur–FA) demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells than un-conjugated one. When we studied the storage stability and bioactivity, NS CS -Cur formulation showed significant stability (up to 30 days) with ignorable loss in its bioactivity. Hence, we concluded from our findings that curcumin loaded protein nanostructure (NS CS -Cur) might be used to achieve higher stability, enhanced dispersibility in suspension as well as improved bioactivity of curcumin which also can be used in the pharmaceutical application. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) play a significant role in regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions such as cancers. However, it remains a challenging problem to discover the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of a miRNA in a data driven fashion. On one hand, sequence-based methods for predicting miRNA targets tend to make too many false positive calls. On the other hand, analyzing expression correlation between miRNAs and mRNAs cannot establish whether relationship between a pair of correlated miRNA and mRNA is causal. Methods: In this study, we designed a deep learning model, referred to as miRNA causal deep net (mCADET), which aims to explicitly represent two types of statistical relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs: correlation resulting from confounded co-regulation and correlation as a result of causal regulation. The model utilizes a deep neural network to simulate transcription mechanism that leads to co-expression of miRNA and mRNA, and, in addition, it also contains directed edges from miRNAs to mRNAs to capture causal relationships among them. Results: We trained the mCADET model using pan-cancer miRNA and mRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to investigate mechanism of co-expression and causal interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs. Quantitative analyses of the results indicate that the mCADET significantly outperforms conventional deep learning models when modeling combined miRNA and mRNA expression data, indicating its superior capability of capturing the high-order statistical structures in the data. Qualitative analysis of predicted targets of miRNAs indicate that predictions by mCADET agree well with existing knowledge. Finally, the predictions by mCADET have a significantly lower false discovery rate and better overall accuracy in comparison to sequence-based and correlation-based methods when comparing to experimental results. Conclusion: The mCADET model can simultaneously infer the states of cellular signaling system regulating co-expression of miRNAs and mRNAs, while capturing their causal relationships in a data-driven fashion. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The WWOX gene has a WW domain containing oxidoreductase, which is located at the common fragile site FRA16D at chromosome 16q23. WWOX is a tumor suppressor gene that has been associated with several types of cancer such as hepatic, breast, lung, prostate, gastric, and ovarian. Recently WWOX has been implicated in epilepsy, where studies show homozygous loss-of-function mutation lead to early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy, spinocerebellar ataxia, intractable seizures and developmental delay, and early lethal microcephaly syndrome with epilepsy. Here we investigate two consanguineous Saudi families and we identified three probands with epileptic encephalopathy. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous mutation in the WWOX gene in one proband. In addition, we identified a previously reported WWOX mutation in two probands. Later on these findings were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. The underlying mechanism on how WWOX mutations lead to seizure remains elusive. To date very few WWOX mutations have been associated with neurological disorder and our newly identified mutations support the notion that WWOX play an important role in neurons and will aid in better diagnosis and genetic counseling. © 2018 Salleh N.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to detect the expression of fork-head box D3 (FOXD3) and investigate its diagnostic value in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIAL AND METHODS The relative expression of FOXD3 at mRNA and protein levels was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis, respectively. Chi-square test was used to explore the relevance of FOXD3 expression with clinical features of NSCLC patients. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was built to estimate the diagnostic value of FOXD3 in distinguishing NSCLC patients from healthy controls. RESULTS Serum FOXD3 expression was weakly expressed in NSCLC patients compared to the controls at mRNA and protein levels (P<0.001) and low FOXD3 expression was positively correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and differentiation. The ROC curve indicated that FOXD3 acts as a diagnostic bio-marker for NSCLC patients, with an AUC of 0.826 corresponding to a sensitivity of 77.1% and a specificity of 74.6%, and an optimal cutoff point of 2.38. CONCLUSIONS Decreased expression of serum FOXD3 was observed in NSCLC patients, and it was found to be a potential molecular marker for the diagnosis of NSCLC.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines the extent of social interactions in an individual’s decision to undergo mammography. Using Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System surveys from 1993 to 2016, the effect of other female screening behavior on an individual’s decision to have a routine breast cancer screening was measured by calculating the size of a so called “social multiplier” in mammography. A vector of social multipliers was estimated in the use of mammograms in the past 1–2 years by taking the ratio of group-level effects of exogenous explanatory variables to individual-level effects of the same variables. Peer groups were defined as same-aged women living in the same state. Three age groups of women were considered: 40–49, 50–74, and 75 and older. Several econometric approaches were used to analyze the effect of social interactions on mammography use, including ordinary least squares, fixed effects, and split-sample instrumental variable. For all women, evidence was found of social interactions associated with individual’s education, employment, and poor health. In addition, number of age-group-specific social multipliers was found. The strongest evidence of spillover in mammography was found for women ages 75 and older. Policy makers should be aware that, in the presence of a social multiplier, the value of any type of screening intervention is higher than the one that would be measured at the individual-level. © 2018, International Atlantic Economic Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: With the rapid accumulation of genomic data, it has become a challenge issue to annotate and interpret these data. As a representative, Gene set enrichment analysis has been widely used to interpret large molecular datasets generated by biological experiments. The result of gene set enrichment analysis heavily relies on the quality and integrity of gene set annotations. Although several methods were developed to annotate gene sets, there is still a lack of high quality annotation methods. Here, we propose a novel method to improve the annotation accuracy through combining the GO structure and gene expression data. Results: We propose a novel approach for optimizing gene set annotations to get more accurate annotation results. The proposed method filters the inconsistent annotations using GO structure information and probabilistic gene set clusters calculated by a range of cluster sizes over multiple bootstrap resampled datasets. The proposed method is employed to analyze p53 cell lines, colon cancer and breast cancer gene expression data. The experimental results show that the proposed method can filter a number of annotations unrelated to experimental data and increase gene set enrichment power and decrease the inconsistent of annotations. Conclusions: A novel gene set annotation optimization approach is proposed to improve the quality of gene annotations. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively improves gene set annotation quality based on the GO structure and gene expression data. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) behaves as a tumor suppressor by decreasing the expression of oncogenes involved in multiple carcinogenic pathways. Intravenous delivery of miR-34a mimics has been investigated in clinical trials as a potential treatment for advanced cancers; however, the effect of miR-34a on cancer immune surveillance is controversial. In the current study, we found that miR-34a plays a dual role in the regulation of major histocompatibility complex class I-related sequence B (MICB) protein, a ligand of the NKG2D receptor. MiR-34a could both induce and reduce MICB expression by upregulating ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinase and downregulating the transcription factor E2F1, respectively. The net effect of miR-34a on MICB expression depended on endogenous E2F1 levels. Overexpression of miR-34a promoted MICB expression in hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells that have low E2F1 levels but not in HCC cells that have high E2F1 levels. In HCC patients, the expression of miR-34a and MICB showed positive correlation in paratumor liver tissues, which have low E2F1 levels, but not in HCC tissues, which have high E2F1 levels. We showed that miR-34a overexpression in non-transformed liver cells enhanced cytolysis and interferon-γ production by NK-92MI cells. Furthermore, higher miR-34a expression in tumor and paratumor tissues was associated with positive and negative outcomes, respectively, in HCC patients. Our findings suggest that miR-34a induces MICB expression in paratumor liver tissues, which may cause liver damage and serious cytokine release syndrome, thus disclosing potential side effects of systemic administration of miR-34a in anticancer therapy.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The Translational Research and Patients safety in Europe (TRANSFoRm) project aims to integrate primary care with clinical research whilst improving patient safety. The TRANSFoRm International Research Readiness survey (TIRRE) aims to demonstrate data use through two linked data studies and by identifying clinical data repositories and genetic databases or disease registries prepared to participate in linked research. METHOD: The TIRRE survey collects data at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of granularity; to fulfil data, study specific, business, geographical and readiness requirements of potential data providers for the TRANSFoRm demonstration studies. We used descriptive statistics to differentiate between demonstration-study compliant and non-compliant repositories. We only included surveys with >70% of questions answered in our final analysis, reporting the odds ratio (OR) of positive responses associated with a demonstration-study compliant data provider. RESULTS: We contacted 531 organisations within the Eurpean Union (EU). Two declined to supply information; 56 made a valid response and a further 26 made a partial response. Of the 56 valid responses, 29 were databases of primary care data, 12 were genetic databases and 15 were cancer registries. The demonstration compliant primary care sites made 2098 positive responses compared with 268 in non-use-case compliant data sources [OR: 4.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.93-5.35, p < 0.008]; for genetic databases: 380:44 (OR: 6.13, 95% CI: 4.25-8.85, p < 0.008) and cancer registries: 553:44 (OR: 5.87, 95% CI: 4.13-8.34, p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: TIRRE comprehensively assesses the preparedness of data repositories to participate in specific research projects. Multiple contacts about hypothetical participation in research identified few potential sites.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Many mathematical and statistical models and algorithms have been proposed to do biomarker identification in recent years. However, the biomarkers inferred from different datasets suffer a lack of reproducibilities due to the heterogeneity of the data generated from different platforms or laboratories. This motivates us to develop robust biomarker identification methods by integrating multiple datasets. Methods: In this paper, we developed an integrative method for classification based on logistic regression. Different constant terms are set in the logistic regression model to measure the heterogeneity of the samples. By minimizing the differences of the constant terms within the same dataset, both the homogeneity within the same dataset and the heterogeneity in multiple datasets can be kept. The model is formulated as an optimization problem with a network penalty measuring the differences of the constant terms. The L 1 penalty, elastic penalty and network related penalties are added to the objective function for the biomarker discovery purpose. Algorithms based on proximal Newton method are proposed to solve the optimization problem. Results: We first applied the proposed method to the simulated datasets. Both the AUC of the prediction and the biomarker identification accuracy are improved. We then applied the method to two breast cancer gene expression datasets. By integrating both datasets, the prediction AUC is improved over directly merging the datasets and MetaLasso. And it's comparable to the best AUC when doing biomarker identification in an individual dataset. The identified biomarkers using network related penalty for variables were further analyzed. Meaningful subnetworks enriched by breast cancer were identified. Conclusion: A network-based integrative logistic regression model is proposed in the paper. It improves both the prediction and biomarker identification accuracy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common tumor in southern China with marked ethnic and geographic distributions and concomitant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, the molecular basis of NPC remains largely unknown, and the role of EBV genomic variations in the pathogenesis of NPC is unclear. Whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 12 EBV-positive paired NPC tumor/peripheral blood samples from Hunan Province was performed, and the FBXO11 gene was subjected to further functional analyses. We identified 69 missense mutations in signaling pathways typically altered in cancer, including NF-κB and Wnt/Hedgehog/Notch. Additionally, 122 variations were identified in non-coding regions. Among these, a subset of genes was confirmed as dysregulated in NPC by mining the NPC cDNA microarray database. The randomly selected gene, FBXO11, could promote the malignant progression of NPC in vitro. Full-length EBV genomes from 8 of the 12 patients with NPC were also successfully assembled, and latent EBV infection is a primary cause of NPC. The various subtypes of EBV detected exhibited clear correlations with its geographical distribution. This study has explored novel biological markers and tumorigenic pathways with substantial potential to enhance therapeutic strategies for NPC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hemodynamically irrelevant pericardial effusion (PeEf) is a predictor of adverse outcome in heart failure patients. The clinical relevance of a PeEf unrelated to surgery in heart transplant patients remains unknown. This study assesses the prognostic value of PeEf occurring later than 1 year after transplantation. Methods: All patients undergoing heart transplantation in Zurich between 1989 and 2012 were screened. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze mortality (primary) and hospitalization (secondary endpoint). PeEf time points were compared to baseline for rejection, immunosuppressants, tumors, inflammation, heart failure, kidney function, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic parameters. Results: Of 152 patients (mean age 48.3 ± 11.9), 25 developed PeEf. Median follow-up period was 11.9 (IQR 5.8–17) years. The number of deaths was 6 in the PeEf group and 46 in the non-PeEf group. The occurrence of PeEf was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of death (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.02–6.13, p = 0.046) and hospitalization (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.57–4.1, p = 0.0002). Conclusions: This study reveals that the finding of hemodynamically irrelevant PeEf in heart transplant patients is a predictor of adverse outcome, suggesting that a careful clinical assessment is warranted in heart transplant patients exhibiting small PeEf. © 2018 Via Medica.",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs) elicit various physiological responses in cellular environment, and the effect of NPs on cell migration is of high interest. In this work, the effects of NPs on cell migration and their possible mechanisms were studied. Here, we showed that after exposure to pegylated titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-PEG NPs, where PEG stands for the polyethylene glycol), NCI-H292 cells exhibited slower migration than control cells. Furthermore, larger NPs inhibited cell migration much stronger than smaller NPs. Following NP exposure, the cells showed decreased expression of integrin beta 1 and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK), and disrupted F-actin structures. We demonstrated that a possible mechanism involved NP-mediated promotion of the lysosomal degradation of integrin beta 1, thus leading to reduced expression of pFAK and cytoskeletal disruption and inhibited cell migration. Therefore, our results showed that inhibition of NCI-H292 cell migration by NPs is mediated through integrin beta 1, which provides useful information for the application of NPs in cancer therapy and related fields. © 2018 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Background: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effect is a fundamental problem in biological and medical applications. Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify the subgroups that respond differently towards a treatment, and they rely on a fitness criterion to minimize the error between the estimated treatment effects and the unobservable ground truths. Results: In this paper, we propose that a heterogeneity criterion, which maximizes the differences of treatment effects among the subgroups, also needs to be considered. Moreover, we show that better performances can be achieved when the fitness and the heterogeneous criteria are considered simultaneously. Selecting the optimal splitting points then becomes a multi-objective problem; however, a solution that achieves optimal in both aspects are often not available. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-objective splitting procedure to balance both criteria. The proposed procedure is computationally efficient and fits naturally into the existing recursive partitioning framework. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-objective approach performs consistently better than existing ones. Conclusion: Heterogeneity should be considered with fitness in heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and the proposed multi-objective splitting procedure achieves the best performance by balancing both criteria. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays important roles in some malignant tumors. However, the mechanism underlying how lncRNA regulates hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) process remains largely unknown. In this study, we explored the potential role of lncRNA 00607 as a novel tumor suppressor in HCC. In this study, we examined the regulation of lncRNA 00607 by the important inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We also determined the expression of LINC000607 in 159 HCC tumors and paired adjacent tissues. Effects of LINC000607 in HCC proliferation and apoptosis were examined in vitro in HCC cell lines and in vivo tumor xenografts. Furthermore, we also examine underlying mechanism by which lncRNA 00607 regulates NF-κB p65 and how LIN00607 exerts its tumor suppressor role in HCC. We found that lncRNA 00607 expression level is lower in HCC tumors compared with matched normal liver tissue, and its low expression predicts worse prognosis in HCC. Functionally, lncRNA 00607 overexpression leads to decreased HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, enhanced apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity. Mechanistically, lncRNA 00607 inhibits the p65 transcription by binding to the p65 promoter region, therefore contributing to increased p53 levels in HCC. Taken together, the findings of this study show that the TNF-α/IL-6-lncRNA 00607-NF-κB p65/p53 signaling axis represents a novel therapeutic avenue in cancer chemotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is formed in cooked meats and may be linked to dietary-associated colorectal, prostate and mammary cancers. Genotoxic N-oxidized metabolites of PhIP react with the Cys34 of albumin (Alb) to form a sulfinamide adduct, a biomarker of the biologically effective dose. We examined the kinetics of PhIP-Alb adduct formation in plasma of volunteers on a 4-week semicontrolled diet of cooked meat containing known quantities of PhIP. The adduct was below the limit of detection (LOD) (10 femtograms PhIP/mg Alb) in most subjects before the meat feeding but increased by up to 560-fold at week 4 in subjects who ate meat containing 8.0 to 11.7 μg of PhIP per 150-200 g serving. In contrast, the adduct remained below the LOD in subjects who ingested 1.2 or 3.0 μg PhIP per serving. Correlations were not seen between PhIP-Alb adduct levels and PhIP intake levels (P = 0.76), the amount of PhIP accrued in hair (P = 0.13), the amounts of N-oxidized urinary metabolites of PhIP (P = 0.66) or caffeine CYP1A2 activity (P = 0.55), a key enzyme involved in the bioactivation of PhIP. The half-life of the PhIP-Alb adduct was <2 weeks, signifying that the adduct was not stable. PhIP-Alb adduct formation is direct evidence of bioactivation of PhIP in vivo. However, the PhIP hair biomarker is a longer lived and more sensitive biomarker to assess exposure to this potential human carcinogen.",

    "Abstract": "Ser139-phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) is a functional biomarker of DNA double-strand breaks. However, its conventional detection for in vivo samples relies on immunological methods using anti-γH2AX antibodies, making quantitative analysis difficult. Here, we established an absolute γH2AX quantification in vivo method for multiple organs in mice using liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. When applying the method to male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice (8 weeks old), the testes showed the highest γH2AX level (2.3% of total H2AX), followed by the bone marrow (0.51%), stomach (0.28%), kidney (0.20%), spleen (0.20%), liver (0.15%) and lung, which had the lowest overall level (0.10%). After intraperitoneal administration of 2 mg/kg mitomycin C in mice, γH2AX levels increased until 2-4 h, followed by a monotonical decrease to the control level in the bone marrow and spleen, and increased moderately until 24 h, followed by a slight decrease by 48 h in the liver, stomach, lung and kidney. After oral administration of 400 mg/kg ethyl methanesulphonate, γH2AX levels increased until 8 h and then decreased to the control level by 24-48 h in the spleen and kidney, increased until 24 h and then slightly decreased until 48 h in the bone marrow and lung, increased until 8 h and plateaued by 48 h in the liver, and decreased until 8 h and then increased to the control level in the stomach. Both the genotoxic chemicals did not alter γH2AX levels in the testes. These results indicate that our novel method could reveal variation in the γH2AX state in mouse organs and allows monitoring of the in vivo dynamics induced by genotoxic chemicals. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapy is a promising advancement in the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), although much of how lung tumors interact with the immune system in the natural course of disease remains unknown. We investigated the impact of the expression of immune-centric genes and pathways in tumors on patient survival to reveal novel candidates for immunotherapeutic research. Tumor transcriptomes and detailed clinical characteristics were obtained from patients with NSCLC who were participants of either the Inflammation, Health and Lung Epidemiology (INHALE) (discovery, N = 280) or The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Lung (replication, N = 1026) studies. Expressions of 2253 genes derived from 48 major immune pathways were assessed for association with patient prognosis using a multivariable Cox model and pathway effects were assessed with an in-house implementation of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm. Prognosis-guided gene and pathway analysis of immune-centric expression in tumors revealed significant survival enrichments across both cohorts. The 'Interleukin Signaling' pathway, containing 430 genes, was found to be statistically and significantly enriched with prognostic signal in both the INHALE (P = 0.008) and TCGA (P = 0.039) datasets. Subsequent leading-edge analysis identified a subset of genes (N = 23) shared between both cohorts, driving the pathway enrichment. Cumulative expression of this leading-edge gene signature was a strong predictor of patient survival [discovery: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.59, P = 3.0 × 10-8; replication: HR = 1.29, P = 7.4 × 10-7]. These data demonstrate the impact of immune-centric expression on patient outcomes in NSCLC. Furthermore, prognostic gene effects were localized to discrete immune pathways, of which Interleukin Signaling had the greatest impact on overall survival and the subset of genes driving these effects have promise for future therapeutic intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled parallel assays of chromatin accessibility and gene expression for major human cell lines. Such innovation provides a great opportunity to decode phenotypic consequences of genetic variation via the construction of predictive gene regulatory network models. However, there still lacks a computational method to systematically integrate chromatin accessibility information with gene expression data to recover complicated regulatory relationships between genes in a tissue-specific manner. Results: We propose a Markov random field (MRF) model for constructing tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory networks via integrative analysis of DNase-seq and RNA-seq data. Our method, named CSNets (cell-line specific regulatory networks), first infers regulatory networks for individual cell lines using chromatin accessibility information, and then fine-tunes these networks using the MRF based on pairwise similarity between cell lines derived from gene expression data. Using this method, we constructed regulatory networks specific to 110 human cell lines and 13 major tissues with the use of ENCODE data. We demonstrated the high quality of these networks via comprehensive statistical analysis based on ChIP-seq profiles, functional annotations, taxonomic analysis, and literature surveys. We further applied these networks to analyze GWAS data of Crohn's disease and prostate cancer. Results were either consistent with the literature or provided biological insights into regulatory mechanisms of these two complex diseases. The website of CSNets is freely available at http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/jianglab/CSNETS/. Conclusions: CSNets demonstrated the power of joint analysis on epigenomic and transcriptomic data towards the accurate construction of gene regulatory network. Our work provides not only a useful resource of regulatory networks to the community, but also valuable experiences in methodology development for multi-omics data integration. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Evaluating the significance for a group of genes or proteins in a pathway or biological process for a disease could help researchers understand the mechanism of the disease. For example, identifying related pathways or gene functions for chromatin states of tumor-specific T cells will help determine whether T cells could reprogram or not, and further help design the cancer treatment strategy. Some existing p-value combination methods can be used in this scenario. However, these methods suffer from different disadvantages, and thus it is still challenging to design more powerful and robust statistical method. Results: The existing method of Group combined p-value (GCP) first partitions p-values to several groups using a set of several truncation points, but the method is often sensitive to these truncation points. Another method of adaptive rank truncated product method(ARTP) makes use of multiple truncation integers to adaptively combine the smallest p-values, but the method loses statistical power since it ignores the larger p-values. To tackle these problems, we propose a robust p-value combination method (rPCMP) by considering multiple partitions of p-values with different sets of truncation points. The proposed rPCMP statistic have a three-layer hierarchical structure. The inner-layer considers a statistic which combines p-values in a specified interval defined by two thresholds points, the intermediate-layer uses a GCP statistic which optimizes the statistic from the inner layer for a partition set of threshold points, and the outer-layer integrates the GCP statistic from multiple partitions of p-values. The empirical distribution of statistic under null distribution could be estimated by permutation procedure. Conclusions: Our proposed rPCMP method has been shown to be more robust and have higher statistical power. Simulation study shows that our method can effectively control the type I error rates and have higher statistical power than the existing methods. We finally apply our rPCMP method to an ATAC-seq dataset for discovering the related gene functions with chromatin states in mouse tumors T cell. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This work demonstrated an effective strategy for the capture, identification and determination of multiple types of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) on functional and biocompatible immunomagnetic nanosphere interfaces (IMNs). The IMNs were achieved by functionalizing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanospheres (Fe 3 O 4 ) with polymerized ionic liquid (PIL), and then coating with epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule antibody (anti-EpCAM). The IMNs exhibited outstanding cell capture efficiency (above 95%) and specificity when employed to separate multiple EpCAM-positive tumor cells, due to the abundant carboxyl groups in the structure of PIL, which enhanced the coupling efficiency of MNs with anti-EpCAM by chemical bonding between carboxyls and amines, thereby enabling more target cells adhered onto IMNs. Under the optimized capture conditions, IMNs were shown an excellent cell capture performance in the range of 5–400 cells/mL in three different cases (e.g., PBS, MCF-7 and THP-1 mixed cell suspension, lysed blood). More significantly, our results indicated that with modification of PIL, in addition to the capture efficiency, the cell viability rate of CTCs was also greatly improved (98%) owing to the nontoxic and biocompatible properties of PIL, which realized the proliferation of the rare number CTCs for further molecular characterization. Finally, the IMNs were successfully applied to the isolation and detection of CTCs in cancer patient peripheral blood samples and as low as one CTC in the whole blood was captured and identified by the ICC method. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 is a putative antioxidant and has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments, including cancer. While it is known that cell behavior can be modulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the contributions of lncRNAs in EGb 761-induced anti-cancer effects are largely unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS Colon cancer cell lines HT29 and HCT116 were used in this study. RT-qPCR was used to detect the relative expression of lincRNA-p21 in colon cancer cells. Wound-healing assay and Matrigel Transwell assay were performed to investigate the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments were used to verify ubiquitination and the interaction between lincRNA-p21 and E-cadherin, or E-cadherin and b-transducin repeat containing (BTRC) E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. RESULTS Cell function assay verified that treatment with EGb 761 suppressed the migratory and invasive abilities of colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner via the suppression of E-cadherin expression level. lincRNA-p21 was upregulated in colon cancer cells after treatment with EGb 761, and knockdown of lincRNA-p21 reversed the EGb 761-induced anti-metastatic effect. Furthermore, lincRNA-p21 was localized in cytoplasm of colon cells and regulated E-cadherin expression at a post-transcriptional level. Specifically, lincRNA-p21 promotes E-cadherin stability by preventing the interaction between BTRC and E-cadherin, which leads to the inhibition of E-cadherin ubiquitination. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that lincRNA-p21 mediates the anti-cancer effect of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 by stabilizing E-cadherin protein in colon cancer, which may help define the functional role of EGb 761 in cancer treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is beginning to be recognized as a valid weapon for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) when chemotherapy fails. Ipilimumab (ipi) is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity of CTLA4. It also has a molecular weight of 148 kDa and is water-soluble at physiological pH. Ipi was first approved by the FDA for the treatment of malignant melanoma and is currently being studied in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, with promising early results. Areas covered: The aim of this review is to collate the most significant preclinical and clinical studies available that look at ipi to propose new strategies for the future. Expert opinion: Additional studies are required to reduce toxicity and increase the activity of ipi in PCa. A possible strategy is to combine ipi with standard anti-cancer therapeutics such as vaccines, PDL1 inhibitors, antiandrogen drugs, and chemotherapy agents. Several initial results have suggested that combination strategies are useful to increase the activity in mCRPC, even if the toxicity of the treatment can increase. The activity of combined treatments is still not predictable, but considering the ongoing studies, we believe that they have good potential that will lead to the discovery of an optimal therapeutic strategy. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Molecular alterations that occur in cancer have the potential to be considered as either cancer biomarkers or targeted therapies or even both. In the presented study, we aimed to elucidate the gene regulatory network of metastatic colorectal cancer using data acquired from microarrays to reach the most common DEGs in colorectal cancer metastasis and find their possible regulatory mechanism by DETFs and DEmiRs. In this regards, seven microarray datasets were employed to assess the most important DEGs, DETFs and DEmiRs in colorectal cancer metastasis. Afterward, GRN based on DETFs and DEmiRs were constructed. Also ARACNE algorithm was used to construct an accurate GRN. GRN was analyzed structurally and then, two DETFs (LEF1 and ETV4) and a less-well known DEG (FABP6) by real time qRT-PCR in 50 patients with colorectal cancer were quantified. The constructed GRN highlighted the importance of some DETFs and DEmiRs in colorectal cancer metastasis. Interestingly the gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR on three candidate genes (LEF1, ETV4 and FABP6) indicated that the three genes were co-expressed in tumor samples, and were significantly associated with metastasis in colorectal cancer. Therefore, our experimental results proved a part of our comprehensive data analysis and system biology results. In summary, according to our empirical study we found the importance of three candidate genes as the potent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer metastasis. Also our study in a holistic insight on gene regulatory mechanism revealed the importance of some gene regulatory factors (DETFs and DEmiRs) and their potential as prognostic factors and/or targets in molecular targeted therapies in colorectal cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Breast Cancer is the most common cancer among women with several genes involved in disease susceptibility. As majority of genome-wide significant variants fall outside the coding region, it is likely that some of them alter specific gene functions. GWAS database was used to interpret the regulatory functions of these genetic variants. A total of 320 SNPs for breast cancer were selected via GWAS, which were entered into the SNAP web portal tool, to determine the one's found to be in Linkage Disequilibrium (r2 &lt; 0.80). The resulting 2024 proxy SNP's were processed in RegulomeDB to predict their regulatory role. Of these, 1440 produced a score ranging from 1–6, whereas the remaining produced no data. Only the variants under score 4 (cut-off value) in RegulomeDB has been studied further. From these variants, 221 had scores of less than 4, indicating a high degree of potential regulatory role associated with them. Further study revealed that 61 of the 221 SNPs were reported to be genome-wide significant for breast cancer, 52 to be associated with other diseases, 99 as unconfirmed for association with breast cancer, leaving only 9 to be novel proxy SNPs linked to breast cancer. Therefore, the study further confirmed postulation of non-coding variants being linked to disease risk thereby, requiring additional validation through genome-wide association studies to substantiate their underlying mechanism. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion were frequently found in prostate cancer, and thought to play some fundamental mechanisms for the development of prostate cancer. However, until now, the clinical and prognostic significance of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion was not fully understood. In this study, based on the 281 prostate cancers that constructed from a historical watchful waiting cohort, the statistically significant associations between TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and clinicopathologic characteristics were identified. In addition, the Elastic Net algorithm was used to predict the patients with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status, and good predictive results were obtained, indicating that this algorithm was suitable to this prediction problem. The differential gene network was constructed from the network, and the KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that the module genes were significantly enriched in several important pathways. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of cancer cells plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. We developed a novel DNA-labeled sandwich electrochemical biosensor based on a glassy carbon electrode modified with 3D graphene and a hybrid of Au nanocages (Au NCs)/amino-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-NH 2 ) for label-free and selective detection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells via differential pulse voltammetry. The layer-by-layer assembly and cell-detection performance of the Au NCs/MWCNTs-NH 2 -based biosensor were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Owing to the advantages of DNA-labeled antibodies and a nanomaterial-based signal amplification strategy, the fabricated cytosensor exhibited high specificity and sensitivity when detecting MCF-7 cells in the range of 1.0 × 10 2 to 1.0 × 10 6 cells mL −1 with a low detection limit of 80 cells mL −1 (3σ/slope). Furthermore, the biosensor exhibited high selectivity when detecting MCF-7 cells and showed considerable potential for practical applications. The proposed DNA-labeled sandwich electrochemical biosensor provides a stable, sensitive approach to detecting cancer cells and is promising in terms of potential applications to cancer diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the most aggressive human malignancies with a low survival rate. Hyperoside (quercetin-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside) is a flavonol glycoside with an anti-cancer activity. The microRNA-let-7 was widely regarded as a tumor suppressor in human tumors. Here, we investigated the role of hyperoside and let-7a-5p on the lung cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in A549 cells in vitro. Our results showed that hyperoside could inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells through inducing apoptosis and G1/S phase arrest. Let-7a-5p could inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells via inhibiting the process of G1/S phase. Additionally, hyperoside and let-7a-5p had a synergetic effect on suppressing the proliferation of A549 cells; microRNA-let-7a-5p directly regulated the expression of CCND1 in A549 cells. Our study illustrated that hyperoside and microRNA-let7a-5p might provide a synergistic effect on anti-cancer, which may provide a new idea for lung cancer treatment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The successful development of selective detection of cancer cells from normal cells is a highly demanded but challenging task. Herein, we have developed a rapid and label-free impedimetric biosensor for quantitative determination of cancer cells with high glycoprotein expression. Homogenously distributed 2–9 nm graphene quantum dots (GQDs) was anchored on the surface Fe3O4 through covalent bonding. Concovalin A (ConA) was then adhered onto GQDs by physical mixing to fabricate ConA-GQD@Fe3O4 nanosensing probe. A good dynamic range in the cell concentration of 5 × 102–1 × 105 cells mL-1 with LOD values of 246 and 367 cells mL-1 for HeLa and MCF-7, respectively, is obtained. The impedimetric responses to the cancerous HeLa and MCF-7 cells are 16.7 and 13.1 times higher than those of their original sensor electrodes. However, the interaction between sensing probe and normal MCF-10 and bEnd.3 cells is negligible, confirming the specific selectivity toward cancer cells. Cellular uptake images as well as in-vitro cytotoxicity corroborates the electrochemical results. In addition, the successful detection of cancer cells in human serum and circulating tumor cells in blood sample envisions the feasibility of using ConA-GQD@Fe3O4 as the nanosensing probe for clinically early diagnosis of cancer cells with high glycoprotein expression. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer models, activation of Aurora A kinase (AURKA) is associated with downregulation of ERα expression and resistance to endocrine therapy. Alisertib is an oral selective inhibitor of AURKA. The primary objectives of this phase I trial were to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluate the toxicities and clinical activity of alisertib combined with fulvestrant in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods In this standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation phase I study, postmenopausal patients with endocrine-resistant, ER+ MBC previously treated with endocrine therapy were assigned to one of two dose levels of alisertib (40 or 50 mg) in combination with fixed-dose fulvestrant. Results Ten patients enrolled, of which nine were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The median patient age was 59. All patients had secondary (acquired) endocrine resistance, and all had received prior aromatase inhibitor. Six had experienced disease progression on fulvestrant. There were no severe (grade 3+) toxicities reported during cycle 1 at either dose level. The median progression-free survival time was 12.4 months (95% CI 5.3–not met), and the 6-month clinical benefit rate was 77.8% (95% CI 40.0–87.2%). Conclusions In patients with endocrine-resistant, ER+ MBC, alisertib in combination with fulvestrant was well tolerated. A favorable safety profile was observed. The RP2D is 50 mg twice daily on days 1–3, 8–10, and 15–17 of a 28-day cycle with standard dose fulvestrant. Promising antitumor activity was observed, including activity among patients with prior progression on fulvestrant. © The Author(s) 2017. This article is an open access publication.",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: We explored the trend in lung cancer incidence rates among a young Swiss population (30–54 years old) by sex from 1990 to 2014 to investigate the birth cohort effect on lung cancer. We evaluated smoking rates from 1992 to 2012 to explain sex differences in lung cancer incidence rates. METHODS: The data of the Swiss National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER) were used. We extracted the data of age-standardized (world) and age-specific incidence rates (per 100,000 people at risk) of trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers by sex and year of diagnosis from 1990 to 2014. The data on tobacco consumption were generated from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. These data were based on Swiss Health Surveys, involving 5-year intervals from 1992 to 2012. RESULTS: Incidence rates decreased among men in the age groups 40–44, 45–49, and 50–54 years. An increased rate was seen among women in age group 50–54 years. Among men, rates generally decreased in successive birth cohorts, whereas among women, the rates increased from the cohort born in 1935–1939 up to the 1950s, and then were steady. In the cohort born in 1940–1944 an increased rate was seen until the 1960s, and then they decreased. In the cohort born in 1945–1949 the rates remained steady. Smoking prevalence was higher among men than among women in all age and birth groups. Among men born in the mid-1950s or mid-1960s, smoking prevalence has become higher for younger compared to older men. This pattern was only seen among younger women born in the mid-1960s. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing lung cancer incidence rates in young Swiss men but increasing rates in young women reflect the evolution of the smoking epidemic in the world. Our findings indicate an urgent need for implementing prevention strategies that target tobacco cessation and prevention among young women. © 2018 EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd.

    "Abstract": "RON receptor tyrosine kinase is a transmembrane protein directly involved in suppression of inflammation and its aberrant expression linked to cancers and metastasis. Efforts to block deregulated RON signaling in tumors using small molecule kinase inhibitors or antibodies have been complicated by the presence of unknown number/types of isoforms of RON, which, despite being structurally similar, localize differently and mediate varied functions. Current study was designed to identify the splice variants of RON transcripts formed by skipping of sequences between exons 9 and 14 for better understanding of isoform specific RON signaling in cancers. PCR amplification and bi-directional sequencing of a 901 bp cDNA sequence located between exons 9 to 14 of RON from lung cancer cell lines revealed the presence of two splicing variants formed by skipping of exons 11 and 11–13. Each of these transcripts was found in more than one cell line. Expressed sequence tag (EST) database search indicated that the splicing variant lacking exons 11–13 was a novel one. Here we conclude that the splice variants of RON lacking exon 11 and exons 11–13 were detected in several lung cancer cell lines. Novel variant formed by skipping exons 11–13, the sequence of which code for transmembrane region, is predicted to code for a truncated isoform that may be secreted out. Tumors may antagonize the ligand dependent anti-inflammatory function of wild-type RON by secreting out the ligand binding isoforms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), a heterogeneous class of tumors, represents approximately 85% of all new lung cancer diagnosis. Conventional treatment options have limited efficacy because most cases are in the advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. The present study evaluates the anti-cancer activity of 1,2-diazole (pyrazole), a natural compound from mangrove plant Rhizophora apiculata (R.apiculata) on A549 lung carcinoma cells. In the present study the anti-cancer mechanism of pyrazole, was examined by the expression level of proteins Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) which are commonly associated with the cell signaling pathways that control cell survival and apoptosis, that could facilitate to develop a novel target and effective treatment approach for patients with NSCLC. Pyrazole significantly induced cell cycle arrest and initiated apoptosis through inhibition of downstream components of EGFR tyrosine kinase pathway. Pyrazole disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential and modulated the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2 which could probably lead to caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, Pyrazole suppresses the expression of CDK-2 resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and in the G1-S phase transition. Taken together, the current study provides new insight in to the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-cancer activity of pyrazole in NSCLC, A549 cells. The study opens an avenue for development of a natural compound as a potential therapeutic agent which could target cell signaling pathways to combat human NSCLC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) are one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic genomes with extraordinarily diverse functions. ZNF233 is located on 19q13.31 and encodes a 670-amino acid protein belonging to the Krüppel C2H2-type ZNF family. However, little is known about the role of ZNF233 in cancer progression. In this study, we reported for the first time that ZNF233 mRNA was remarkably up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues in comparison with corresponding non-tumorous normal liver tissues. ZNF233 expression level was correlated with tumor grade, tumor stage and prognosis of HCC patients. We further investigated the effect of ZNF233 on HCC cell growth. It is found that overexpression of ZNF233 in SMMC-7721 could promote G1/S transition and thus accelerate cell growth ratio. Consistently, knockdown of ZNF233 in QGY-7701 cells successfully suppressed cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Further immunohistochemical staining revealed a reduced Ki-67-positive cell percentage in xenografted tumor derived from ZNF233-knocking down cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate a positive role of ZNF233 in regulating HCC cell growth. ZNF233 might be developed as a novel biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Bladder cancer (BC) has been regarded as the most common malignancy of the urinary system worldwide. With lack of investigations for molecular pathogenesis underlying that develop BC, the therapeutic efficacy of several therapeutic approaches existing is still unsatisfactory. Here, our study aimed to explore the potentially biological function of MAN1B1 on BC. In this study, MAN1B1 expression level in BC tissues and normal tissues was analyzed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and correlation between its expression and prognosis was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Knockout of MAN1B1 was performed using silencing RNA and the efficacy of MAN1B1 knockout was identified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The BC cells proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, and then the cells apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry following MAN1B1 knocked down by small interfering RNA. Protein kinase B (AKT) signaling was evaluated by detecting related markers, namely AKT, p-AKT, 4E-BP-1 and Bax using western blot assay. As a result, the MAN1B1 expression was higher in BC tissues than those in normal tissues, besides, its overexpression was associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, MAN1B1 reduction by silencing RNA approach resulted in BC cells proliferation suppression and BC cells apoptosis promotion. Finally, AKT signaling activity was inhibited by MAN1B1 silencing. Taken together, these results unraveled that MAN1B1 may act on an oncogenic action in BC, which improved the likelihood of MAN1B1 taking on a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential target for treating BC. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are entrained within glaciers globally, reemerging in many alpine ecosystems. Despite available data on POP flux from glaciers, a study of human health risk caused by POPs released in glacial meltwater has never been attempted. Glaciers in the European Alps house the largest known quantity of POPs in the Northern Hemisphere, presenting an opportunity for identification of potential risk in an endmember scenario case study. With methodology developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we provide a regional screening level human risk analysis of one class of POPs, polychlorinated-biphenyls (PCB) that have been measured in melt waters from the Silvretta Glacier in the Swiss Alps. Our model suggests the potential for both cancer and non-cancer impacts in residents with lifetime exposure to current levels of PCB in glacial meltwater and average consumption of local fish. For residents with an abbreviated 30-year exposure timeframe, the risk for cancer and non-cancer impacts is low. Populations that consume higher quantities of local fish are predicted to be at a greater risk, with risk to lifetime consumers higher by an order of magnitude. Based on the results of our screening study, we suggest that local government move to the next step within the risk assessment framework: local monitoring and management. Within the Alps, other glacial watersheds of a similar size and latitude may see comparable risk and our model framework can be adapted for further implementation therein. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Malfunction of apoptosis plays a key role in carcinogenesis. Previous studies have reported that polymorphisms in caspase genes could lead to poor apoptotic signaling, thus facilitating the onset of several human cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between three polymorphisms (rs1049216, rs2705897 and rs4647603) of the CASP3 gene and the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in Galicia (NW Spain).The relationship between these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and PCa in European populations has yet to be studied. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a case-control study on a total of 243 patients with PCa and 191 healthy individuals, genotyping all polymorphisms using the matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) method. Overall, none of the polymorphisms were clearly associated with the risk of PCa. Nevertheless, the results drawn from this study suggest that genetic variability in the CASP3 gene, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors may influence the predisposition to develop PCa in the Galician population. Specifically, the results of study seem to hint at a higher risk of PCa in smokers of up to 20 pack-years (PY) and carriers of both the CASP3-rs1049216 GG genotype and the G allele (OR = 3.61, p = 0.044; OR = 1.71; p = 0.018). In addition, the GG and AG genotypes showed increased predisposition to PCa in overweight individuals (OR = 4.43, p = 0.040; OR = 2.00; p = 0.022). Finally, the CASP3-rs4647603 CT genotype and T allele were associated with a higher susceptibility to PCa in obese individuals (ORCT/TT = 4.30, p = 0.003; ORT/C = 3.58, p = 0.004). Further replication studies in other populations are required to assess these findings. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "An improved amperometric sarcosine biosensor was constructed based on covalent immobilization of sarcosine oxidase nanoparticles (SOxNPs) onto gold electrode (AuE). The SOxNPs/AuE was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at different stages of its construction. The biosensor worked optimally within 2 s at a potential of 1.0 V, against Ag/AgCl, pH 6.5 and 35 °C. A linear relationship was observed between sarcosine concentration range, 0.1–100 μM and the biosensor response i.e. current in mA under optimum conditions. The biosensor offered a low detection limit of 0.01 μM and gratifying storage stability. The SOxNPs/AuE was unaffected by a number of serum substances at their physiological concentrations. The biosensor measured sarcosine level in sera collected from persons suffering from prostate cancer (mean13.5 μM, n = 8), which was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those in apparently healthy persons (mean 2.2 μM, n = 8). The SOxNPs/Au electrode was reused 300- times during the span of 180 days, with only 10% loss in its initial activity while being stored dry at 4 °C. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to be dysregulated in glioma. However, how lncRNA participates in the process of glioma development and progression still remains elusive. Here, we identified a novel lncRNA LOC728196 highly expressed in glioma tissues. LOC728196 high expression predicts low survival rate in patients. Our data proved that LOC728196 knockdown repressed cellular growth, migration and invasion in vitro. Silencing LOC728196 led to impaired growth of glioma in vivo. Mechanistic studies further demonstrated that LOC728196 acts as the sponge for miR-513c to upregulate TCF7 expression. We observed a reciprocal inhibition between LOC728196 and miR-513c. Rescue assay showed that either inhibition of miR-513c or TCF7 overexpression restored the abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion in LOC728196–silenced glioma cells. Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive investigation on the role of LOC728196 in glioma progression and contributes to understanding the vital role of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In some clinical settings such as the cancer immunotherapy trials, a treatment time-lag effect may be present and the lag duration possibly vary from subject to subject. An efficient study design and analysis procedure should not only take into account the time-lag effect but also consider the individual heterogeneity in the lag duration. In this paper, we present a Generalized Piecewise Weighted Logrank (GPW-Logrank) test, designed to account for the random time-lag effect while maximizing the study power with respect to the weights. Based on the proposed test, both analytic and numeric approaches are developed for the sample size and power calculation. Asymptotic properties are derived and finite sample efficiency is evaluated in simulations. Compared with the standard practice ignoring the delayed effect, the proposed design and analysis procedures are substantially more efficient when a random lag is expected; further, compared with the existing methods by Xu et al considering the fixed time-lag effect, the proposed approaches are significantly more robust when the lag model is misspecified. An R package (DelayedEffect.Design) is developed for implementation. Published 2018. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.",

    "Abstract": "Detection of telomerase activity is crucial for the telomerase-related early diagnosis of cancer and drug screening. Herein, a multicolor visual telomerase detection method with high sensitivity was developed based on the etching of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-stablized Au nanorods (Au NRs) by the oxidation state 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine sulfate (TMB2+). In order to meet the demand of bare-eye inspection, an enzyme-free signal amplification strategy of catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) was incorporated. After the introduction of telomerase, telomerase extension products specifically triggered cyclic CHA and led to the successive formation of G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme, which catalyzed the H2O2-mediated oxidation of TMB. The Au NRs were gradually etched as the concentration of catalysate TMB2+ increased, resulting in the decrease of aspect ratio of the Au NRs. Correspondingly, the longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance peak of Au NRs was blue-shifted, with the concomitant generation of a series of color transition. Under optimal conditions, a highly sensitive detection toward telomerase was realized down to 15 HeLa cells. Compared to previous colorimetric method for telomerase determination, multiple colors corresponding to telomerase activity was the most attractive virtue of our approach. More strikingly, telomerase-induced cyclic CHA significantly enhanced the accumulation of G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme, thus the signal amplification was effectively realized. Our approach exhibited excellent sensitivity and convenient signal readout, which is expected to provide great potential application in cancer diagnosis and therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "An early on-time detection of breast cancer can effectively affect the outcome of the treatment. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive, simple and reliable immunosensor to detect the lowest alteration of CA 15-3, the standard biomarker of breast cancer patients. The proposed immunosensor was achieved by modification of gold electrode by streptavidin to immobilize the biotinylated anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Bovine serum albumin was used to prevent nonspecific binding. To improve the sensitivity of modified immunosensor, the sandwich signal enhancer consisting of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads conjugated with biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and anti-CA 15-3 biotinylated mAb was applied. The electrochemical measurements were obtained in the presence of hydroquinone as a redox agent and H2O2 as the activating agent of HRP. Under optimized condition and using square wave voltammetry, the lower limit of quantification was obtained as 15 × 10−6 U/mL and the linear CA 15-3 concentration range was 50–15 × 10−6 U/mL. While showing significant stability, the immunosensor displayed an excellent sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CA 15-3 even in the human serum as compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a gold standard method. Based on our findings, the engineered immunosensor is proposed as a robust diagnostic tool for the clinical determination of CA 15-3 and other cancer biomarkers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in a variety of diseases, including many tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the function and mechanisms responsible for these molecules in HCC are not thoroughly understood. In our previous study, we found that LINC00052 was acted as a tumor suppressor in HCC. In this study, we performed transcription microarray analysis to investigate the target gene of LINC00052, and found that knockdown of LINC00052 significantly increased the expression of SRY-related HMG-box gene 9 (SOX9), which plays an oncogenic role in HCC. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay revealed that LINC00052 promoted miR-101-3p expression by enhancing its promoter activity. In addition, online database analysis tools and luciferase assays showed that miR-101-3p could target SOX9. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that miR-101-3p was downregulated in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. And we found a positive relationship between LINC00052 and miR-101-3p, and a negative relationship between miR-101-3p and SOX9 in HCC tissues. Besides, miR-101-3p was involved in LINC00052 inhibits HCC cells proliferation and metastasis. At the molecular level, LINC00052 downgulated SOX9 to inhibit HCC cells proliferation and metastasis by interacting with miR-101-3p. It might be a potential application for HCC therapy. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Increasing reports demonstrated that miRNAs play a critical role in tumor development and progression. Previous studies revealed that miR-1301 was abnormally expressed in various cancers. However, its function and underlying mechanism in osteosarcoma (OS) remains unknown. In this study, miR-1301 expression was significantly down-regulated in both OS tissues and cell lines. Down-regulated miR-1301 was obviously associated with malignant clinical features and poor overall survival of OS patients. miR-1301 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, we identified BCL9 act as a direct target of miR-1301 by directly binding to its 3′-UTR. In clinical OS tissues, miR-1301 negatively correlated BCL9 expression. BCL9 was up-regulated in OS tissues and cells. BCL9 overexpression promoted OS progression. Moreover, restoration of BCL9 expression at least partially abolished the proliferation, migration and invasion of miR-1301 on OS cells. In conclusion, our data indicated that miR-1301 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion of OS by targeting BCL9, and may represent a novel potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for OS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Glioma is a wide category of brain tumor originates from glial cells. Lower-Grade Glioma (LGG) consists of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III gliomas. Since the LGGs can infiltrate into adjacent areas, the complete removal of tumor is difficult and it results in recurrence and malignant progression to high grade glioma. Our study uncovers robust survival indicators in LGG which can be checked by immunohistochemistry to predict the outcome of lower grade. In addition, it unravelled the novel therapeutic targets in order to improve the survival of LGG patients. Methods: To identify a prognostic signature based on protein expression in LGGs, we analysed Reverse Phase Protein Array data of LGG samples (n = 380) from The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. We made random stratification of samples into discovery (n = 228) and validation datasets (n = 152). We performed multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of proteins (n = 219) using discovery dataset with age, WHO grade and IDH mutation status. Results: We identified four-protein prognostic signature that can segregate patients into high- and low-risk. The signature estimates poor overall survival for high-risk patients in both discovery (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.18–7.75; p < 0.0001) and validation datasets (HR = 3.49; 95% CI = 1.52–8.01; p < 0.0001). Among the four markers, CHK2_pT68 was found to be protective, while MSH6, ARID1A and PAXILLIN were associated with poor survival. Additionally, Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of this signature with age, WHO grade and IDH mutation status revealed this prognostic signature to be an independent prognosticator in both datasets.

    "Abstract": "Biosensing and detecting the rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in complex blood samples are a great challenge but necessary for cancer metastasis prevention. Here we show a novel highly-sensitive biosensing system for detecting CTCs in whole blood. The system is composed of Her2-coated immunomagnetic beads and an anti-EpCAM aptamer assembled pseudo-DNA nanocatenane (PDN) for dual targeting and separating CTCs, in conjunction with the rolling circle amplification (RCA) and molecular beacon (MB) system for CTCs signal amplification. The Her-2-coated beads separated CTCs from blood after their elution from a magnetic column. The unique PDN, which is a tailor-designed self-assembly of three circular DNAs that are inter-locked with independent and non-interfered templates for periodic RCA process, binds EpCAM-rich CTCs. In the presence of the RCA primer, phi29 DNA polymerase and MB, the system collaboratively generated the amplified fluorescent signals for highly-sensitive detection of CTCs. Through this system, we achieved the limit of detection less than 10 CTCs/mL blood, and quantified the number of CTCs in patient blood, which is proportional to the patient cancer status. Our technique is highly-sensitive, practicable and convenient enough for clinical detection of breast CTCs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Exosomes as cell-derived vesicles have the potential to be novel biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis of cancers. However, cost-effective detection of exosomes in routine clinical settings is still challenging. Herein, we present a ZnO nanowires coated three-dimensional (3D) scaffold chip device for effective immunocapture and classically visible and colorimetric detection of exosomes. The chip device is composed of 3D polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) scaffold skeleton covered by free-standing ZnO nanowire array. The interconnected micropores of 3D scaffold induces the fluid flow with chaotic or vortex feature, and ZnO nanowire array provides large surface area for immobilization of exosome specific antibody as well as size exclusion-like effect for retaining exosomes. These synergistically and significantly enhance the capture of exosomes at a high flow rate. The captured exosomes are detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled antibody which can initiate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-based colorimetric sensing. The quantitative readout of exosomes is easily accomplished by UV–vis spectrometry or microplate reader with a linear range of 2.2 × 10 5 to 2.4 × 10 7 particles/μL and a minimal detectable concentration of 2.2 × 10 4 particles/μL. This chip device was applicable to clinical samples where cancer patients demonstrate statistically significant increase in exosomes compared with healthy individuals. Thus, our chip device is cost-effective and easy-to-use, facilitating visible and colorimetric assay with high sensitivity toward clinical applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We identified and investigated the prognostic value of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and evaluate the relationship between the SPP1 expression level and clinical characteristics. First, SPP1 was identified through four LUAD datasets in GEO database and validated by the TCGA database. Then a total of 149 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included, as well as their clinicopathological characteristics collected in the study. The expression levels of SPP1 and adjacent normal tissues were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The association between SPP1 and its prognostic value was systematically evaluated. Results showed high SPP1 level predicted poorer LUAD survival by univariate Cox analysis (P = 0.017), and the multivariate result was also significant (P = 0.021). Subgroup analysis suggested the prognostic value of SPP1 was significant in stage T1 (log rank P = 0.011), stage N0 (log rank P = 0.046) and stage N1 (log rank P = 0.009) patients. After including these markers into a nomogram, the Harrell's C-index of the nomogram was 0.694.

    "Abstract": "With the development of the ultra high voltage transmission technology, the voltage level of transmission line rised. Accordingly, the strength of electric field in the vicinity of transmission line increased, thus possible health effects from electric field have caused many public attentions. In this study, in order to compare effects induced by static electric field (SEF) and power frequency electric field (PFEF) on immune function, Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were exposed to 35 kV/m SEF (0 Hz) and PFEF (50 Hz),respectively. Several indicators of white blood cell, red blood cell as well as hemoglobin in peripheral blood were tested after exposure of 7, 14 and 21 days, respectively. There was no significant difference in any indicators under SEF exposure of 35 kV/m for 7d, 14d and 21d between experimental group and control group. Under the PFEF exposure of 35 kV/m, white blood cell count significantly reduced after exposure of 7d, 14d and 21d. Meanwhile, red blood cell count significantly reduced after exposure of 7d, and returned to normal level through the compensatory response of organism after exposure of 14d and 21d. Hemoglobin concentration significantly decreased only after exposure of 21d. Based on tested results of hematological indicators, SEF exposure of 35 kV/m did not affect immune functions in mice but PFEF exposure of 35 kV/m could cause a decline of immune function. This difference of effects from SEF and PFEF on immune function was possibly caused by the difference of the degree of molecular polarization and ion migration in organism under exposure of two kinds of electric fields. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Bioactive compounds from fruits play a protective role for human body against various diseases. These biologically active constituents can be isolated and employed in alternative medicine. Phloridzin is phenolic phyto-constituent, it was firstly isolated from the bark of apple trees. This secondary metabolite belongs to the chemical class of dihydrochalcones, which represent more than 90% of the soluble phenolics. Phloridzin itself is a highly potent phytochemical, however, structural modifications have made its spectrum of potential pharmacological efficacies more diverse. The current review mainly highlights the biosynthesis and pharmacological activities like anti-cancer, anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-ageing, anti-microbial and melanogenic activities, exhibited by phloridzin and its conjugates. © 2019, SILAE (Italo-Latin American Society of Ethnomedicine).

    "Abstract": "A versatile label-free electrochemical biosensor based on dual enzyme assisted multiple amplification strategy was developed for ultrasensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The biosensor consists of a triple-helix molecular switch (THMS) as molecular recognition and signal transduction probe, ribonuclease HII (RNase HII) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) as dual enzyme assisted multiple amplification accelerator. The presence of target ctDNA could open THMS and trigger RNase HII-assisted homogenous target recycling amplification to produce substantial signal transduction probe (STP). The released STP hybridized with the capture probe immobilized on a gold electrode, then TdT and assistant probe were further employed to fulfill TdT-mediated cascade extension and generate stable DNA dendritic nanostructures. The electroactive methyl blue (MB) was finally used as the signal reporter to realize the multiple electrochemical amplification ctDNA detection as the amount of MB is positively correlated with the target ctDNA. Combined with the efficient recognition capacity of the designed THMS and the excellent multiple amplification ability of RNase HII and TdT, the constructed sensing platform could detect KRAS G12DM with a wide detection range from 0.01 fM to 1 pM, and the limit of detection as low as 2.4 aM. Besides, the platform is capable of detecting ctDNA in biological fluid such as plasma. More importantly, by substituting the loop of THMS with different sequences, this strategy could be conveniently expanded into the detection of other ctDNA, showing promising potential applications in clinical cancer screening and prognosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a novel simple and sensitive electrochemical immunosensor was developed based on lactate oxidase as a single electrochemical probe for the detection of carcinoma antigen 125 (CA125). Chitosan-gold nanoparticle/multiwall carbon nanotube/graphene oxide (CS-AuNP/MWCNT/GO) was used as the electrode substrate to increase the electrode specific surface area and improve the protein immobilization and the electrochemical performance of the electrode in terms of oxidation of H2O2. Due to the peroxidase-like function of CS-AuNP, the oxidation peak of H2O2 was observed at a very low potential (0.034 V). The lactate oxidase is used, for the first time, as the single-enzyme label in a sandwich type immunosensor. In the optimum condition, the designed immunosensor exhibited two linear ranges (0.01–0.5 U/mL and 0.5–100 U/mL)﻿ by ﻿chronoamperometry (CHA). The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 0.002 U/mL. The immunosensor displayed excellent reproducibility and stability with remarkable selectivity in terms of the detection of CA125 even in the human serum samples as compared to the ELISA. In conclusion, the engineered immunosensor is proposed as an ultra-sensitive tool for the detection and monitoring of CA125 in the human serum. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "An improved method was proposed which integrates the distribution of metal speciation simulated by chemical equilibrium model, different exposure models and average daily intake dose modified by analytic hierarchy process for human health risk assessment of metal species (MS). With the rapid development of economic and urbanization, the metals pollution had become more serious in industrial areas. Adverse effects of soil contaminants on human health in typical industrial area should be assessed to evaluate the risks of soils in these areas. The method was applied to study nickel (Ni) species health risks in soil of industrial areas. The pH possessed significant impact to determine distribution/existence and solubility of Ni species, followed by DOC. The non-carcinogenic risk (HQ) of Ni species were less than 1 in each sampling points, except Ni2+. In addition, the carcinogenic risk (CR) of different Ni species were less than 10−6, except for FANi and Ni2+. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: Medicinal plants represent one of the most important source of drugs for several diseases treatment such cancer, due to its richness of alkaloids, polyphenols and terpenes. All these properties gives us the opportunity to come across new therapeutic agents extracted for plants. Hyoscyamus albusL. An old medicinal plant belong to Solonaceae family and which is rich source of alkaloids, tropane and nortropane which confers to this plant a number of very important and benefical therapeutic effet during time. Purpose: Our purpose of the paper is to isolate the atropine as an alkaloid from hyoscyamus albus among its methanolic extract fractions and to evaluate the anticancer activity of atropine on different cancerous cell lines Methodes: Atropine was isolated from Hyoscyamus albus’ L. by using high performance chromatography (HPLC), analytic HPLC, mass spectromerty (MS) and proton NMR (NMR H1), as the effects of atropine were performed on, PC-3, U-87 MG, U-373 MG and DU-145 cells lines and were determined using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide] assay. Results: Our results indicated that atropine represent an important component in hyoscyamus albus and have a strong cytotoxic activity against DU-145 with IC50=417 µg/ml and new activity on U-373 MG cells with IC50= 894 µg/ml. Conclusion: The preliminary results confirm the interesting anticancer activity of H.albus and a support indicative for further investigations on new compounds characterization and molecular mechanisms study. © 2019, SILAE (Italo-Latin American Society of Ethnomedicine).

    "Abstract": "Clinical trials in the era of precision medicine require assessment of biomarkers to identify appropriate subgroups of patients for targeted therapy. In a biomarker-stratified design (BSD), biomarkers are measured on all patients and used as stratification variables. However, such a trial can be both inefficient and costly, especially when the prevalence of the subgroup of primary interest is low and the cost of assessing the biomarkers is high. Efficiency can be improved and costs reduced by using enriched biomarker-stratified designs, in which patients of primary interest, typically the biomarker-positive patients, are oversampled. We consider a special type of enrichment design, an auxiliary variable–enriched design (AEBSD), in which enrichment is based on some inexpensive auxiliary variable that is positively correlated with the true biomarker. The proposed AEBSD reduces the total cost of the trial compared with a standard BSD when the prevalence rate of true biomarker positivity is small and the positive predictive value (PPV) of the auxiliary biomarker is larger than the prevalence rate. In addition, for an AEBSD, we can immediately randomize the patients selected in the screening process without waiting for the result of the true biomarker test, reducing the treatment waiting time. We propose an adaptive Bayesian method to adjust the assumed PPV while the trial is ongoing. Numerical studies and an example illustrate the approach.

    "Abstract": "The ylide-phosphonium salt [PPh3CH2C(O)CH2Cl]+Cl− was reacted with Pd(OAc)2 to give the chloro-bridged dinuclear complex [Pd{C(H)PPh3C(O)CH2Cl}(μ-Cl)(OAc)]2, which experienced bridge cleavage reactions with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and pyridine (Py), and to prepare the new orthometallated complexes [Pd{(C,C)–C6H4PPh2C(H)C(O)CH2Cl}L]Cl, [L = PPh3 (1) and Py (2)]. The complexes were identified and characterized using various techniques. X-ray crystallography was used to determine the crystal structure of 1, which revealed the presence of an orthometallated C6H4-PPh2 unit. CT-DNA binding interaction of the synthesis compounds was tested by fluorescence spectroscopy, UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy, and the viscometric titration method. The analysis of the obtained data indicated that the Pd complexes could bind to DNA via groove binding by the partial intercalation mode. The emission titration of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with two Pd complexes showed a static process for the fluorescence quenching mechanism of BSA. In addition, the results of competitive binding by Eosin-Y, Ibuprofen and Digoxin site markers revealed that the complexes were bound to the site I of BSA. The donor (BSA) - acceptor (Pd complexes) distance was calculated using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Notably, molecular docking studies were used for the determination of DNA and BSA-Pd (II) complexes binding. Finally, the two complexes exhibited significant in vitro cytotoxicity against human leukemic T cell (Jurkat) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) cancer cell lines using MTT([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide] colorimetric. In cell cycle analysis conducted on Jurkat and K562 cells treated with ligand and Pd complexes, a decrease in DNA cell content and shift in the main population of cells toward the subG1 phase were observed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Nitrate pollution has emerged as a problem of great importance because in recent years, the levels of nitrate in soil and groundwater have increased, mainly through anthropogenic activities, such as the use of fertilizers in agriculture, domestic wastewater and septic tanks, industrial waste and deforestation. In animals, nitrate reduction to nitrite (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO) promote the formation of methemoglobin in the blood and the generation of highly reactive intermediates that induce oxidative stress in target organs. Exposition to nitrates has been associated with methemoglobinemia, reproductive toxicity, metabolic and endocrine alterations and cancer. This study analyzed acute intoxication with sodium nitrate (NaNO3) in male Wistar rats, aged 12–16 weeks. Four groups with n = 10 rats each were formed: group 1 was the control, and group 2, group 3 and group 4 were treated for 10 days with intragastric doses of 19, 66 and 150 mg/kg/d NaNO3, respectively. Hematological, metabolic and histological biomarkers in the liver were analyzed. The results showed high percentages of methemoglobin, an increase in NO2 in the plasma and an accumulation in the liver. Moreover, there were high counts of white blood cells and platelets in all treated groups. Additionally, there was an increase in the spleen weight in group 4. High levels of glucose, triglycerides, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were observed and were significantly increased in groups 3 and 4. For oxidative stress biomarkers, there were increases in Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS), total GSH and SOD activity, mainly in group 4. Changes in mitochondrial activity were not significant. Histopathological analyses of the liver showed inflammation, infiltration of mononuclear cells, steatosis, ischemia and necrosis, and these findings were more evident at high doses of NaNO3 in which high of S-nitrosylation were found. In conclusion, NaNO3 was reduced to NO2, thereby inducing methemoglobinemia, whereas other reactive species generated oxidative stress, causing hematological and metabolic alterations and injury to the liver. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Around 50% of breast cancer familial risk has been so far explained by known susceptibility alleles with variable levels of risk and prevalence. The vast majority of these breast cancer associated variations reported to date are from populations of European ancestry. In spite of its heterogeneity and genetic wealth, North-African populations have not been studied by the HapMap and the 1000Genomes projects. Thus, very little is known about the genetic architecture of these populations. Methods: This study aimed to investigate a subset of common breast cancer loci in the general Tunisian population and to compare their genetic composition to those of other ethnic groups. We undertook a genome-wide haplotype study by genotyping 135 Tunisian subjects using the Affymetrix 6.0-Array. We compared Tunisian allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns to those of HapMap populations and we performed a comprehensive assessment of the functional effects of several selected variants. Results: Haplotype analyses showed that at risk haplotypes on 2p24, 4q21, 6q25, 9q31, 10q26, 11p15, 11q13 and 14q32 loci are considerably frequent in the Tunisian population (> 20%). Allele frequency comparison showed that the frequency of rs13329835 is significantly different between Tunisian and all other HapMap populations. LD-blocks and Principle Component Analysis revealed that the genetic characteristics of breast cancer variants in the Tunisian, and so probably the North-African populations, are more similar to those of Europeans than Africans. Using eQTl analysis, we characterized rs9911630 as the most strongly expression-associated SNP that seems to affect the expression levels of BRCA1 and two long non coding RNAs (NBR2 and LINC008854). Additional in-silico analysis also suggested a potential functional significance of this variant. Conclusions: We illustrated the utility of combining haplotype analysis in diverse ethnic groups with functional analysis to explore breast cancer genetic architecture in Tunisia. Results presented in this study provide the first report on a large number of common breast cancer genetic polymorphisms in the Tunisian population which may establish a baseline database to guide future association studies in North Africa. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Exposure to asbestos remains a global issue due to its massive use in the twentieth century and its long environmental persistence. Exposure to asbestos still occurs during dismantling of ships and vessels, buildings renovation, mining operations, and is reported in developing countries. Current estimate report exposure of hundreds of million people in occupational settings in countries where its use remains unregulated. Methods: We conducted a historical prospective cohort mortality study aimed at estimating mortality from specific causes, the temporal changes of pleural and lung cancer mortality, and the attributable fraction (AF) of lung cancer deaths following asbestos exposure. The study included 3984 shipyard workers employed at the shipyard of Genoa, Italy, between 1960 and 1981 and followed up to December 2014. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were computed. Results: Overall deaths recorded were 3331 (83.6%). Excess mortality was observed for all cancers (SMR = 127, 95%CI:120-134), pleural mesothelioma (575, 469-697), cancers of the larynx (183, 134-244) and of the lung (154, 139-170), and for respiratory tract diseases (127, 114-141), including asbestosis (2277, 1525-3270). Ninety out of 399 deaths (22.6%) from lung cancer were attributed to asbestos exposure. The estimated lung cancer AF was 49.3% in workers with the highest SMR for pleural cancer. Median latency times for pleural and lung cancer were 42.8 years (minimum latency: 9.3 years) and 38.7 years (minimum latency: 6 years). The peak of mesothelioma incidence, expected in Italy in the period 2015-2024, was confirmed. Conclusions: The long follow-up period of our study allowed the detection of a substantial disease burden following asbestos exposure. These findings support the urgent need for the prevention of asbestos related diseases through the implementation of asbestos ban worldwide, including those countries where asbestos is still mined, manufactured and used. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study investigated the function of SMAD3 (SMAD family member 3) in regulating PAX6 (paired box 6) in non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: First, qRT-PCR was employed to detect SMAD3 expression in cancer tissues along with normal tissues and four cell lines, including BEAS-2B, H125, HCC827 and A549 cells. SMAD3 was knocked down by small interference RNA (siRNA), and then its expression was determined via qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The correlation between SMAD3 and PAX6 was determined by double luciferase reporter experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Cell viability was evaluated by CCK-8 and colony forming assays, while cell migration and invasion were detected by Transwell analysis. Results: SMAD3 and PAX6 were upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cancer cells. Knocking down SMAD3 and PAX6 by transfection with siRNAs specifically suppressed the expression of SMAD3 and PAX6 mRNA and protein levels. SMAD3 could promote PAX6 transcriptional activity by binding to its promoter. Reduced expression of SMAD3 led to the downregulation of PAX6 mRNA and protein levels along with decreased cell migration, invasion, proliferation and viability in A549 and HCC827 cells. PAX6 overexpression altered the si-SMAD3-induced inhibition of cell migration, invasion, proliferation and viability in A549 and HCC827 cells. Additionally, PAX6 knockdown alone also repressed the cell migration, invasion, proliferation and viability of the cell lines. Conclusions: SMAD3 promotes the progression of non-small cell lung cancer by upregulating PAX6 expression. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Thus far, the incidence, mortality, and temporal trend data of oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) in China were few. We estimated the incidence, mortality, and temporal patterns of OPC in China during 2008-2012 according to the data from 135 population-based cancer registries to better understand the epidemiological pattern of OPC and to provide more precise information for OPC control in China. Methods: According to the data of diagnosed OPC reported to 135 cancer registries during 2008-2012, we calculated age-standardized rate of incidence and mortality by 2000 Chinese standard population (ASRIC and ASRMC) and by 1985 Segi's world standard population (ASRIW and ASRMW) by age, sex, and geographic regions; annual percentage changes of OPC incidence and mortality were calculated using Joinpoint trend analysis. Results: ASRIW and ASRMW were 2.22/100,000 person-years and 0.94/100,000 person-years, respectively. The incidence and mortality in urban areas were higher than those in rural areas. ASRIC and ASRIW of males were higher than those of females. The overall ASRIC of OPC was significantly increased by 6.2% annually between 2003 and 2006 (P = 0.038), but remained stable between 2007 and 2012 (P = 0.392). ASRIC and ASRMC of males and in rural areas were significantly increased in the last decade (P < 0.05), but the rates of females remained stable during the same period (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Across multiple cancer registries in China, there was an obvious increase in OPC in the recent decade, especially for incidence and mortality of males and in rural areas, whereas the rates of females remained stable. A healthy lifestyle should be advocated and early diagnosis and early treatment of OPC should be enhanced. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Even clearly resectable pancreatic cancer still has an unfavorable prognosis. Neoadjuvant or perioperative therapies might improve the prognosis of these patients. Thus, evaluation of perioperative chemotherapy in resectable pancreatic cancer in a prospective, randomized trial is warranted. A substantial improvement in overall survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with FOLFIRINOX and nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine vs standard gemcitabine has been demonstrated in phase III-trials. Indeed nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine has a more favorable toxicity profile compared to the FOLFIRINOX protocol and appears applicable in a perioperative setting. Methods: NEONAX is an interventional, prospective, randomized, controlled, open label, two sided phase II study with an unconnected analysis of the results in both experimental arms against a fixed survival probability (38% at 18 months with adjuvant gemcitabine), NCT02047513. NEONAX will enroll 166 patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (≤ cT3, N0 or N1, cM0) in two arms: Arm A (perioperative arm): 2 cycles nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2)/gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, d1, 8 and 15 of an 28 day-cycle) followed by tumor surgery followed by 4 cycles nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine, Arm B (adjuvant arm): tumor surgery followed by 6 cycles nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine. The randomization (1:1) is eminent to avoid allocation bias between the groups. Randomization is stratified for tumor stage (ct1/2 vs. cT3) and lymph node status (cN0 vs. cN1). Primary objective is disease free survival (DFS) at 18 months after randomization. Key secondary objectives are 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and DFS rate, progression during neoadjuvant therapy, R0 and R1 resection rate, quality of life and correlation of DFS, OS and tumor regression with pharmacogenomic markers, tumor biomarkers and molecular analyses (ctDNA, transcriptome, miRNA-arrays). In addition, circulating tumor-DNA will be analyzed in patients with the best and the worst responses to the neoadjuvant treatment. The study was initiated in March 2015 in 26 centers for pancreatic surgery in Germany. Discussion: The NEONAX trial is an innovative study on resectable pancreatic cancer and currently one of the largest trials in this field of research.

    "Abstract": "Background: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, can selectively kill cancer cells with little or no cytotoxicity toward normal human cells and is regarded as a potential relatively safe antitumor drug. However, some cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, reagents that potentiate TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity are needed. Herein, we investigated whether shikonin, a natural compound from the root of Lithospermum erythrorhizon, can sensitize TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. Results: The viability of A549 cells, which were resistant to TRAIL, was significantly decreased after treatment with TRAIL followed by shikonin. The underlying mechanisms by which shikonin sensitizes cells to TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity were also examined. Combined treatment with shikonin and TRAIL activated the caspase and JNK pathways, inhibited the STAT3 and AKT pathways, downregulated the expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, c-FLIP and XIAP and upregulated the expression of Bid. Conclusions: In conclusion, the results indicated that shikonin sensitized resistant cancer cells to TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity via the modulation of the JNK, STAT3 and AKT pathways, the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins and the upregulation of proapoptotic proteins. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The Smad7 protein is negative regulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is upregulated in patients with breast cancer. miRNAs regulate proteins expressions by arresting or degrading the mRNAs. The purpose of this work is to identify a miRNAs profile that regulates the expression of the mRNA coding for Smad7 in breast cancer using the data from patients with breast cancer obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. Methods: We develop an automatic search method based on genetic algorithms to find a predictive model based on deep neural networks (DNN) which fit the set of biological data and apply the Olden algorithm to identify the relative importance of each miRNAs. Results: A computational model of non-linear regression is shown, based on deep neural networks that predict the regulation given by the miRNA target transcripts mRNA coding for Smad7 protein in patients with breast cancer, with R2 of 0.99 is shown and MSE of 0.00001. In addition, the model is validated with the results in vivo and in vitro experiments reported in the literature. The set of miRNAs hsa-mir-146a, hsa-mir-93, hsa-mir-375, hsa-mir-205, hsa-mir-15a, hsa-mir-21, hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-503, hsa-mir-29c, hsa-mir-497, hsa-mir-107, hsa-mir-125a, hsa-mir-200c, hsa-mir-212, hsa-mir-429, hsa-mir-34a, hsa-let-7c, hsa-mir-92b, hsa-mir-33a, hsa-mir-15b, hsa-mir-224, hsa-mir-185 and hsa-mir-10b integrate a profile that critically regulates the expression of the mRNA coding for Smad7 in breast cancer. Conclusions: We developed a genetic algorithm to select best features as DNN inputs (miRNAs). The genetic algorithm also builds the best DNN architecture by optimizing the parameters. Although the confirmation of the results by laboratory experiments has not occurred, the results allow suggesting that miRNAs profile could be used as biomarkers or targets in targeted therapies. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The GTPase KRas4B has been utilized as a principal target in the development of anticancer drugs. PDE6δ transports KRas4B to the plasma membrane, where it is released to activate various signaling pathways required for the initiation and maintenance of cancer. Therefore, identifying new small molecules that prevent activation of this GTPase by stabilizing the KRas4B-PDE6δ molecular complex is a practical strategy to fight against cancer. Methods: The crystal structure of the KRas4B-PDE6δ heterodimer was employed to locate possible specific binding sites at the protein-protein interface region. Virtual screening of Enamine-database compounds was performed on the located potential binding sites to identify ligands able to simultaneously bind to the KRas4B-PDE6δ heterodimer. A molecular dynamics approach was used to estimate the binding free-energy of the complex. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. G-LISA was used to measure Ras inactivation. Western blot was used to measure AKT and ERK activation. MIA PaCa-2 cells implanted subcutaneously into nude mice were treated with D14 or C22 and tumor volumes were recorded. Results: According to the binding affinity estimation, D14 and C22 stabilized the protein-protein interaction in the KRas4B-PDE6δ complex based on in vitro evaluation of the 38 compounds showing antineoplastic activity against pancreatic MIA PaCa-2 cancer cells. In this work, we further investigated the antineoplastic cellular properties of two of them, termed D14 and C22, which reduced the viability in the human pancreatic cancer cells lines MIA PaCa-2, PanC-1 and BxPC-3, but not in the normal pancreatic cell line hTERT-HPNE. Compounds D14 and C22 induced cellular death via apoptosis. D14 and C22 significantly decreased Ras-GTP activity by 33% in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Moreover, D14 decreased AKT phosphorylation by 70% and ERK phosphorylation by 51%, while compound C22 reduced AKT phosphorylation by 60% and ERK phosphorylation by 36%. In addition, compounds C22 and D14 significantly reduced tumor growth by 88.6 and 65.9%, respectively, in a mouse xenograft model. Conclusions: We identified two promising compounds, D14 and C22, that might be useful as therapeutic drugs for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treatment. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Abundant evidence shows that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is heterogeneous, and many efforts have been devoted to identifying TNBC subtypes on the basis of genomic profiling. However, few studies have explored the classification of TNBC specifically based on immune signatures that may facilitate the optimal stratification of TNBC patients responsive to immunotherapy. Methods: Using four publicly available TNBC genomics datasets, we classified TNBC on the basis of the immunogenomic profiling of 29 immune signatures. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods were used to perform the classification. Results: We identified three TNBC subtypes that we named Immunity High (Immunity-H), Immunity Medium (Immunity-M), and Immunity Low (Immunity-L) and demonstrated that this classification was reliable and predictable by analyzing multiple different datasets. Immunity-H was characterized by greater immune cell infiltration and anti-tumor immune activities, as well as better survival prognosis compared to the other subtypes. Besides the immune signatures, some cancer-associated pathways were hyperactivated in Immunity-H, including apoptosis, calcium signaling, MAPK signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and RAS signaling. In contrast, Immunity-L presented depressed immune signatures and increased activation of cell cycle, Hippo signaling, DNA replication, mismatch repair, cell adhesion molecule binding, spliceosome, adherens junction function, pyrimidine metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, and RNA polymerase pathways. Furthermore, we identified a gene co-expression subnetwork centered around five transcription factor (TF) genes (CORO1A, STAT4, BCL11B, ZNF831, and EOMES) specifically significant in the Immunity-H subtype and a subnetwork centered around two TF genes (IRF8 and SPI1) characteristic of the Immunity-L subtype. Conclusions: The identification of TNBC subtypes based on immune signatures has potential clinical implications for TNBC treatment. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Return to work (RTW) is a key parameter of outcome quality that ensures social participation. Therefore, this study analyses the sociodemographic and disease-related determinants of RTW among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. Methods: In a prospective, multicentre cohort study, breast cancer patients were surveyed three times: directly after surgery, after 10 weeks, and after 40 weeks. Logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate the association of RTW at 40 weeks following discharge with sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics (n = 577). Results: The sociodemographic variables \"entrance certificate at a university of applied science\" compared to \"university entrance certificate\" (OR = 3.1, 95%-CI = 1.2-8.1), age group \"55-59 years\" compared to \"18-44 years\" (OR = 3.2, 95%-CI = 1.2-8.4) and \"having children\" (OR = 2.8, 95%-CI = 1.2-6.2) as well as the disease-related variables \"rehabilitation\" (OR = 0.5, 95%-CI = 0.3-0.9), self-rated health \"good\" and \"excellent\" compared to \"bad\" (OR = 2.7, 95%-CI = 1.4-5.5; OR = 11.6, 95%-CI = 4.2-31.8) and the UICC-classification \"stage II\" and \"stage III/IV\" in comparison to \"stage 0/I\" (OR = 0.5, 95%-CI = 0.3-0.8; OR = 0.2, 95%-CI = 0.1-0.5) significantly affect RTW among breast cancer patients (Nagelkerke's Pseudo-R2 = 0.275). Conclusions: The findings show that significant differences in RTW exist between patient groups and suggest that RTW issues must be addressed more effectively before, during and after treatment. For future research on RTW in Germany, longitudinal studies with a follow-up of several years are necessary. Information and support deficits should be tackled by social services or breast care nurses.

    "Abstract": "Background: Fully automated assessment of mammographic density (MD), a biomarker of breast cancer risk, is being increasingly performed in screening settings. However, data on body mass index (BMI), a confounder of the MD-risk association, are not routinely collected at screening. We investigated whether the amount of fat in the breast, as captured by the amount of mammographic non-dense tissue seen on the mammographic image, can be used as a proxy for BMI when data on the latter are unavailable. Methods: Data from a UK case control study (numbers of cases/controls: 414/685) and a Norwegian cohort study (numbers of cases/non-cases: 657/61059), both with volumetric MD measurements (dense volume (DV), non-dense volume (NDV) and percent density (%MD)) from screening-age women, were analysed. BMI (self-reported) and NDV were taken as measures of adiposity. Correlations between BMI and NDV, %MD and DV were examined after log-transformation and adjustment for age, menopausal status and parity. Logistic regression models were fitted to the UK study, and Cox regression models to the Norwegian study, to assess associations between MD and breast cancer risk, expressed as odds/hazard ratios per adjusted standard deviation (OPERA). Adjustments were first made for standard risk factors except BMI (minimally adjusted models) and then also for BMI or NDV. OPERA pooled relative risks (RRs) were estimated by fixed-effect models, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed by the I 2 statistics. Results: BMI was positively correlated with NDV (adjusted r = 0.74 in the UK study and r = 0.72 in the Norwegian study) and with DV (r = 0.33 and r = 0.25, respectively). Both %MD and DV were positively associated with breast cancer risk in minimally adjusted models (pooled OPERA RR (95% confidence interval): 1.34 (1.25, 1.43) and 1.46 (1.36, 1.56), respectively; I 2 = 0%, P &gt;0.48 for both). Further adjustment for BMI or NDV strengthened the %MD-risk association (1.51 (1.41, 1.61); I 2 = 0%, P = 0.33 and 1.51 (1.41, 1.61); I 2 = 0%, P = 0.32, respectively). Adjusting for BMI or NDV marginally affected the magnitude of the DV-risk association (1.44 (1.34, 1.54); I 2 = 0%, P = 0.87 and 1.49 (1.40, 1.60); I 2 = 0%, P = 0.36, respectively). Conclusions: When volumetric MD-breast cancer risk associations are investigated, NDV can be used as a measure of adiposity when BMI data are unavailable. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND This study investigated the diagnostic and prognostic values of kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) in breast cancer (BC) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS All data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas. DESeq was run to test for differentially expressed KIF genes. Patients were divided into high- and low-expression groups according to the median expression values of each KIF genes. Survival data were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard model. Comprehensive survival analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of the prognostic signature. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to identify associated gene ontology and KEGG pathways. RESULTS Bioinformatics analysis showed that all KIF genes were significantly enriched during DNA replication and the cell cycle, and co-expressed with each other. Thirteen KIF genes were differentially expressed in cancer and adjacent tissues, and high levels of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A genes were significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS). GSEA showed that BC patients with high expression of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A were enriched in the cell cycle process, P53 regulation pathway and mismatch repair. Combinations of low expression of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A were more highly correlated with favorable OS. Nomograms showed that the KIF4A risk score provided the maximum number of risk points (range 0-100), whereas other genes made a lower contribution. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that 13 KIF genes are differentially expressed in BC tumor tissues, and KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A are associated with prognostic factors in BC.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) exhibits oncogenic activity in different types of cancer, including ovarian cancer (OC). However, its regulatory mechanism in OC and whether TGF-β1 is involved in chemosensitivity regulation remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of TGF-β1 in OC. METHODS: The OC cell line SKOV3 was employed, and TGF-β1 overexpression or knockdown vectors were constructed. The cell proliferation of SKOV3 was evaluated with the cell counting kit (CCK8) kit after treatment with different concentrations of cis-platinum. Western blot and protein immunoprecipitation were employed to detect changes in BRCA1 and Smad3 expression and their interactions. Tumor growth in nude mice was evaluated. RESULTS: The results showed that TGF-β1 knockdown increased chemosensitivity by promoting BRCA1 expression and Smad3 phosphorylation. In vivo studies showed that TGF-β1 knockdown significantly inhibited the growth of tumors, also by upregulating BRCA1 expression and Smad3 phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that TGF-β1 knockdown inhibits tumor growth and increases chemosensitivity by promotion of BRCA1/Smad3 signaling.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent event data are often encountered in biomedical research, for example, recurrent infections or recurrent hospitalizations for patients after renal transplant. In many studies, there are more than one type of events of interest. We aimed to identify the association between two types of events using multivariate joint modeling and then apply this statistical method in the clinical data set. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Overall, 342 subjects with breast cancer whose records were registered for follow-up in a Cancer Research Center at Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital, Tehran, Iran from 2006 to 2015 were investigated. These patients were monitored for at least 6 months after diagnosis and their latest status were recorded. Joint frailty model was used for modeling the relationship between two types of recurrences with Frailty package in R software. RESULTS: When the terminal event was considered as death, three-year and five-year survival rates for the patients were 0.79 and 0.68, respectively. Given the results obtained from a fitted joint frailty model, the risk of multiple recurrences (local and metastases) increased for the patients with tumor grades greater than I. CONCLUSION: With regard to the significant variance of the frailty component of the metastases event, it can be inferred that patients with the same predictive variables are prone to different levels of metastases risk and, on the other hand, given the low frequency of types of recurrences, caution should be exercised when considering the obtained results.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) can recur in the brain after whole-brain irradiation (WBI). We documented outcomes after treatment of such recurrences and sought predictors of local control and overall survival (OS). Materials and methods: Eighty-five patients with SCLC and brain recurrence after prophylactic or therapeutic WBI in 1998-2015 were identified and data were extracted from the medical records. Survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to identify factors associated with OS or further brain progression. Results: Brain recurrence was treated by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in 33 patients (39%), repeat WBI in 14 (16%), chemotherapy-only in 16 (19%), and observation in 22 (26%). Median OS time after brain recurrence (OSrec) was 4.3 months for all patients; 6-month OSrec rates were 58% after SRS, 21% after repeat WBI, 50% after chemotherapy-only, and 5% after observation (P < 0.001). Inferior OSrec was associated with poor performance status (ECOG score ≥ 3) and uncontrolled extracranial disease. Superior OSrec was associated with receipt of ≥4 chemotherapy cycles before brain recurrence and receipt of chemotherapy, SRS, or repeat WBI afterward. Receipt of chemotherapy after brain recurrence correlated with brain progression. Conclusions: Some patients with brain recurrence after WBI for SCLC can survive for extended periods with appropriate intervention, especially those with adequate performance status or controlled extracranial disease. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Until recently, cervical mediastinoscopy was considered to be the reference standard for mediastinal staging for Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). In the absence of metastases, mediastinal lymph node involvement is the most important prognostic factor and as such it determines therapeutic strategies. In this study we evaluated the adequacy of cervical mediastinoscopy in NSCLC lymph node staging in a large university hospital over more than a decade. In addition, we determined the influence of: (1) surgeon's experience (2) video-assisted mediastinoscopy (VAM) and (3) patient-related restrictions (PRR) on the adequacy of lymph node sampling. Methods: Between January 2001 and December 2014, 225 patients underwent cervical mediastinoscopy for lymph node staging. Surgical and histological data were reviewed. Thirty-day follow-up was available for all patients. Lymph node sampling was considered adequate when stations 4 L, 4R and 7 were sampled (ESTS guidelines). A surgeon was considered to be experienced when he or she performed at least 40 procedures during the study-period. Results: Intraoperative mortality was 0%. Thirty-day mortality was 1.3%. Overall adequacy of lymph node sampling was 56%. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of lymph node sampling adequacy revealed level of surgical experience and PRR as independent predictors of lymph node sampling adequacy. Conclusions: Surgical experience and PRR independently predict the adequacy of cervical mediastinoscopy in NSCLC lymph node staging. VAM does not independently predict the adequacy of mediastinal lymph node sampling. In light of the expected further decline in mediastinoscopy numbers, we recommend to limit this procedure exclusively to the armamentarium of the experienced thoracic surgeon. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objectives (1) To determine the occult rate of dural invasion in patients with tumors extending to and/or eroding the bony anterior skull base but without evidence of dural invasion on preoperative imaging. (2) To determine the impact of dural resection and of skull base erosion on survival outcomes in this group of patients (without evidence of dural invasion upon preoperative imaging). Study Design Retrospective study. Setting Tertiary care academic center. Participants Patients with sinonasal malignancies with anterior skull base encroachment/erosion without dural invasion on preoperative imaging treated surgically. Main Outcome Measures (1) Histopathologic disease in the dura in patients who had dural resection and (2) Oncologic outcomes (5-year local recurrence, dural recurrence, disease-specific survival, and overall survival) in patients with and without dural resection, and patients with and without skull base erosion. Results Thirty-seven patients were included. The occult rate of dural invasion was 54%. Patients with dural resection had improved margin control versus those without dural resection (90% vs 56%, p = 0.02). Dural resection improved 5-year overall survival only in patients with esthesioneuroblastoma compared with bony skull base resection alone (100% vs 75%, p = 0.03). Patients with skull base erosion had reduced local control versus those without erosion (63% vs 93%, p = 0.047). Conclusion This study suggests a substantial rate of occult dural invasion despite no overt imaging findings. Dural resection may be associated with improved margin control, but no oncologic benefit except for esthesioneuroblastomas, although treatment heterogeneity and small sample size may limit conclusions. © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

    "Abstract": "Background: ESPN (Espin), an actin filament-binding protein, plays an important role in regulating the organization, dimensions, dynamics, and signaling capacities of the actin filament-rich, microvillus-type specializations that mediate sensory transduction in various mechanosensory and chemosensory cells. Recent few studies show that ESPN regulates metastasis and cell proliferation in melanoma. However, the significance of ESPN in other cancers such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains largely unknown. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed in 169 patients with ESCC and correlated with clinicopathological features and survival. The functional role of ESPN in ESCC cells was determined by ESPN-mediated siRNA. Results: Univariate analyses showed that high ESPN expression was associated with inferior overall survival (P = 0.005) and disease-free survival (P = 0.035). High ESPN expression was an independent prognosticator in multivariate analysis for overall survival (P = 0.009, hazard ratio = 1.688) and disease-free survival (P = 0.049, hazard ratio = 1.451). The 5-year overall survival rates were 30% and 54% in patients with high and low expression of ESPN, respectively. Inhibition of endogenous ESPN in ESCC cells decreased ESCC growth by reducing cell proliferating rates. Conclusions: High ESPN expression is independently associated with poor prognosis in patients with ESCC and downregulation of ESPN inhibits ESCC cell growth. Our results suggest that ESPN may be a novel therapeutic target for patients with ESCC. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: Several studies have shown that bariatric surgery reduces long term mortality compared to medical weight loss therapy. In a previous study we have demonstrated that gastric banding (LAGB) is associated with reduced mortality in patients with and without diabetes, and with reduced incidence of obesity co-morbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer) at a 17 year follow-up. The aim of this study was to verify at a longer time interval (23 years) mortality and incidence of co-morbidities in patients undergoing LAGB or medical weight loss therapy. Patients and methods: As reported in the previous shorter-time study, medical records of obese patients [body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 kg/m2 undergoing LAGB (n = 385; 52 with diabetes) or medical treatment (controls, n = 681; 127 with diabetes), during the period 1995-2001 (visit 1)] were collected. Patients were matched for age, sex, BMI, and blood pressure. Identification codes of patients were entered in the Italian National Health System Lumbardy database, that contains life status, causes of death, as well as exemptions, prescriptions, and hospital admissions (proxies of diseases) from visit 1 to June 2018. Survival was compared across LAGB patients and matched controls using Kaplan-Meier plots adjusted Cox regression analyses. Results: Final observation period was 19.5 ± 1.87 years (13.4-23.5). Compared to controls, LAGB was associated with reduced mortality [HR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.80, p = 0.003], significant in patients with diabetes [HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.94, p = 0.034], borderline significant in patients without diabetes [HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.35-1.05, p = 0.076]. LAGB was associated with lower incidence of diabetes (15 vs 75 cases, p = 0.001), of CV diseases (61 vs 226 cases, p = 0.009), of cancer (10 vs 35, p = 0.01), and of renal diseases (0 vs 35, p = 0.001), and of hospital admissions (92 vs 377, p = 0.001). Conclusion: The preventive effect of LAGB on mortality is maintained up to 23 years, even with a decreased efficacy compared with the shorter-time study, while the preventive effect of LAGB on co-morbidities and on hospital admissions increases with time. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chronic diseases such as chagasic megaesophagus (secondary to Chagas' disease) have been suggested as etiological factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; however, the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Objective: We analyzed hotspot PIK3CA gene mutations in a series of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas associated or not with chagasic megaesophagus, as well as, in chagasic megaesophagus biopsies. We also checked for correlations between the presence of PIK3CA mutations with patients' clinical and pathological features. Methods: The study included three different groups of patients: i) 23 patients with chagasic megaesophagus associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (CM/ESCC); ii) 38 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma not associated with chagasic megaesophagus (ESCC); and iii) 28 patients with chagasic megaesophagus without esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (CM). PIK3CA hotspot mutations in exons 9 and 20 were evaluated by PCR followed by direct sequencing technique. Results: PIK3CA mutations were identified in 21.7% (5 out of 23) of CM/ESCC cases, in 10.5% (4 out of 38) of ESCC and in only 3.6% (1 case out of 28) of CM cases. In the CM/ESCC group, PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with lower survival (mean 5 months), when compared to wild-type patients (mean 2.0 years). No other significant associations were observed between PIK3CA mutations and patients' clinical features or TP53 mutation profile. Conclusion: This is the first report on the presence of PIK3CA mutations in esophageal cancer associated with chagasic megaesophagus. The detection of PIK3CA mutations in benign chagasic megaesophagus lesions suggests their putative role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma development and opens new opportunities for targeted-therapies for these diseases. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G is an immune checkpoint molecule, which expression in cervical cancer cells enables them to escape immunosurveillance. To date, limited information has been published on the association of HLA-G genetic background in malignant cells with levels of HLA-G expression and the clinical outcome of patients. Methods: We investigated the influence of the HLA-G 14 bp In/Del (rs66554220) and + 3142C/G (rs1063320) polymorphisms in 130 cases of HPV16 infection, 130 cases of HPV18 infection and 185 age-matched, unrelated, HPV-negative, and cytologically normal Chinese Han women. Case-matched cervical biopsy tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results: Our findings show that the frequency of alleles, 14 bp In (38.5% vs 29.2%, OR = 1.52, P < 0.05) and + 3142G (72.7% vs 57.0%, OR = 2.01, P < 0.05), were significantly increased in the HPV18-infected group compared with the control group. The HLA-G polymorphisms (alleles 14 bp In and + 3142G) are also associated with the progression of HPV18-related cervical lesions. Moreover, HLA-G expression increased from CIN1 to CIN2/3 lesions and was highest in patients with adenocarcinoma; however, a significant association between these characteristics and the HLA-G polymorphisms was not observed. Conclusion: Our results support that the HLA-G 14 bp In and + 3142G alleles are risk factors for HPV18 infections and influence the progression of HPV18-related cervical lesions. This suggests that HLA-G-driven immune mechanisms play an important role in cervical carcinogenesis. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Biological Regulatory Networks (BRNs) are responsible for developmental and maintenance related functions in organisms. These functions are implemented by the dynamics of BRNs and are sensitive to regulations enforced by specific activators and inhibitors. The logical modeling formalism by René Thomas incorporates this sensitivity with a set of logical parameters modulated by available regulators, varying with time. With the increase in complexity of BRNs in terms of number of entities and their interactions, the task of parameters estimation becomes computationally expensive with existing sequential SMBioNET tool. We extend the existing sequential implementation of SMBioNET by using a data decomposition approach using a Java messaging library called MPJ Express. The approach divides the parameters space into different regions and each region is then explored in parallel on High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware. Results: The performance of the parallel approach is evaluated on BRNs of different sizes, and experimental results on multicore and cluster computers showed almost linear speed-up. This parallel code can be executed on a wide range of concurrent hardware including laptops equipped with multicore processors, and specialized distributed memory computer systems. To demonstrate the application of parallel implementation, we selected a case study of Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) in cancer progression to identify potential therapeutic targets against cancer. A set of logical parameters were computed for HBP model that directs the biological system to a state of recovery. Furthermore, the parameters also suggest a potential therapeutic intervention that restores homeostasis. Additionally, the performance of parallel application was also evaluated on a network (comprising of 23 entities) of Fibroblast Growth Factor Signalling in Drosophila melanogaster. Conclusions: Qualitative modeling framework is widely used for investigating dynamics of biological regulatory networks. However, computation of model parameters in qualitative modeling is computationally intensive. In this work, we presented results of our Java based parallel implementation that provides almost linear speed-up on both multicore and cluster platforms. The parallel implementation is available at https://psmbionet.github.io. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The widespread prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its impact on morbidity and mortality requires effective secondary prevention measures. For years, inflammation has been advocated as a key mediator of atherosclerosis and its associated complications. Drugs for secondary prevention of CVD events include interventions aimed at risk factors control and antithrombotic management, but there is no drug currently recommended that specifically targets inflammation. Recently, the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis has been confirmed by a randomized clinical trial of canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks an inflammatory pathway mediated by interleukin-1β. Areas covered: This article reviews the pharmacology of canakinumab, its current clinical development status and upcoming regulatory perspectives. Expert opinion: In the CANTOS trial, canakinumab 150 mg met the pre-specified criteria of statistical significance, showing a reduction in combined cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, re-hospitalization due to urgent revascularization and any coronary revascularization, but no impact on all-cause or cardiovascular death. There were more death attributed to sepsis or infection with canakinu-mab than placebo, but fewer reports of arthritis, gout, osteaoarthritis and cancer-related death. Because interleukin-1β is only one of the potential pro-inflammatory pathways that may serve as a target for atherothrombotic protection, other anti-inflammatory drugs may be the object of future investigations. If approved, the initial penetration of canakinumab will face hurdles in view of cost issues, but costs are likely to decrease if the drug loses its present status of orphan drug with the new indication. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Development of new boron nanocarriers has been a crucial issue to be solved for advancing boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) as an effective radiation treatment for cancers. The present study aimed to create a novel double-thermoresponsive boron-containing diblock copolymer based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) [poly(NIPAAm)], which exhibits two-step phase transitions (morphological transitions) at the temperature region below human body temperature. The boronated diblock copolymer considerably concentrates boron atoms into the water-dispersible (i.e., intravenous-administration possible) nanomicelles self-assembled by the first phase transition, and furthermore the properly controlled size and hydrophobicity of the second phase-transitioned nanoparticles are expected to make a significant contribution to the selective delivery and long-term retention of boron atoms into tumor tissues. Here we present the detailed synthesis of the strategic NIPAAm-based diblock copolymer with 3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid (PBA), i.e., poly(NIPAAm-block-NIPAAm-co-PBA), through a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. Furthermore, the stepwise phase transition behavior of the obtained boronic-acid diblock copolymers was characterized in detail by temperature-variable 1H and 11B-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The phase-transition-induced molecular structural changes, including the structural compositions and sizes of nanomicelles and nanoparticles, are also discussed here. © 2019 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Optical imaging is one of the most common, low-cost imaging tools used for investigating the tumor biological behavior in vivo. This study explores the feasibility and sensitivity of a near infrared fluorescent protein mKate2 for a long-term non-invasive tumor imaging in BALB/c nude mice, by using a low-power optical imaging system. Methods: In this study, breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435s expressing mKate2 and MDA-MB-231 expressing a dual reporter gene firefly luciferase (fLuc)-GFP were used as cell models. Tumor cells were implanted in different animal body compartments including subcutaneous, abdominal and deep tissue area and closely monitored in real-time. A simple and low-power optical imaging system was set up to image both fluorescence and bioluminescence in live animals. Results: The presence of malignant tissue was further confirmed by histopathological assay. Considering its lower exposure time and no need of substrate injection, mKate2 is considered a superior choice for subcutaneous imaging compared with fLuc. On the contrary, fLuc has shown to be a better option when monitoring the tumor in a diffusive area such as abdominal cavity. Furthermore, both reporter genes have shown good stability and sensitivity for deep tissue imaging, i.e. tumor within the liver. In addition, fLuc has shown to be an excellent method for detecting tumor cells in the lung. Conclusions: The combination of mKate2 and fLuc offers a superior choice for long-term non-invasive real-time investigation of tumor biological behavior in vivo. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: There are some limitations of standard chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Vincristine and doxorubicin are commonly used for acute leukemia, but they may induce serious side effects such as cardiomyopathy and neurotoxicity. Furthermore, chemotherapy resistance occurs more and more frequently. Therefore, effective treatment strategies are needed. Histone deacetylase 6 inhibition is considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for acute leukemia, since it is observed that HDAC6 is overexpressed in acute leukemia and regulates tumor survival. Combination therapy for cancer is used to minimize adverse drug effects, reduce drug dosage, enhance efficacy, and prevent drug resistance. In order to improve efficacy of chemotherapy agents of acute leukemia, this study will investigate the effects of combination MPT0G211, a novel histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor, with doxorubicin or vincristine on human acute leukemia cells. Results: MPT0G211 combined with doxorubicin induces DNA damage response on human acute myeloid leukemia cells. MPT0G211 can additionally increase Ku70 acetylation and release BAX to mitochondria. Ectopic expression of HDAC6 successively reversed the apoptosis triggered by the combined treatment. Moreover, co-treatment of MPT0G211 and vincristine may alter microtubule dynamics, triggering acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells arrest in mitotic phase followed by induction of the apoptotic pathway. Finally, MPT0G211 plus doxorubicin or vincristine can significantly improve the tumor growth delay in a tumor xenograft model. Conclusions: Collectively, our data highlighted that MPT0G211 in combination with chemotherapy drugs has significant anticancer activity, suggesting a novel strategy for the treatment of acute leukemia. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Impaired angiogenesis is assumed to be an important factor in the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). However, the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in CTEPH remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the angiogenic potential of ECs from pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) specimens. Methods: We isolated ECs from PEA specimens (CTEPH-ECs) and control EC lines from the intact pulmonary arteries of patients with peripheral lung cancers, using a MACS system. These cells were analyzed in vitro including PCR-array analysis, and the PEA specimens were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the serum HGF levels were determined in CTEPH patients. Results: A three-dimensional culture assay revealed that CTEPH-ECs were highly angiogenic. An angiogenesis-focused gene PCR array revealed a high expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in CTEPH-ECs. The high expression of HGF was also confirmed in the supernatant extracted from PEA specimens. The immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of HGF on the surface of the thrombus vessels. The serum HGF levels in CTEPH patients were higher than those in pulmonary thromboembolism survivors. Conclusion: Our study suggests that there are ECs with pro-angiogenetic character and high expression of HGF in PEA specimens. It remains unknown how these results are attributable to the etiology. However, further investigation focused on the HGF pathway may provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for patients with CTEPH. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chinese herbal formula Shaoyao Gancao decoction (SGD) is often used as an adjuvant with chemotherapeutic agents to treat cancer. Due to the herb-drug interactions, the alternations of drug metabolic enzyme and drug transporters induced by SGD deserve to be explored. We aimed to investigate the effect of SGD on the pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated transcriptional regulation of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and drug transporter multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) in vitro. Besides, we assessed the contribution of constituent herbs to SGD on the regulation of CYP3A4 and MDR1. Methods: The dual luciferase reporter gene system containing the hPXR expression plasmid and the reporter gene plasmid of CYP3A4 or MDR1 was co-transfected to HepG2 and Caco2 cells. Luciferase activities were determined using a Dual-luciferase reporter assay kit. The gene expression of CYP3A4 and MDR1 in the hPXR-transfected LS174T cells were assessed by real-time qPCR. Finally, the contribution of constituent herbs from SGD was evaluated. Results: SGD, Shaoyao and Gancao concentration-dependently increased promoter activities of CYP3A4 and MDR1 in vitro. Moreover, SGD, Shaoyao and Gancao up-regulated CYP3A4 and MDR1 mRNA in hPXR-transfected LS174T cells. As the herbal constituent of SGD, Gancao possesses significantly higher levels of metabolic enzyme and drug transporters compared with Shaoyao. Conclusion: SGD tends to enhance CYP3A4 and MDR1 expression via PXR pathway, especially Gancao provides the main contribution. This study highlights a potential in vitro mechanism for SGD on the regulation of drug metabolic enzymes and drug transporters. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is classified as a benign tumor, it may undergo malignant transformation and metastasize in extremely rare occasions. High aberrant expression of CSF1 has been implicated in the development of TGCT and recent studies have shown promising activity of several CSF1R inhibitors against benign diffuse-type TGCT; however, little is known about their effects in malignant TGCT. Case presentation: Information from six consenting patients (3 men, 3 women) with malignant TGCT presenting to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for initial or subsequent consultation was collected. Median age at initial diagnosis of TGCT was 49.5 years (range 12-55), and median age at diagnosis of malignant TGCT was 50 years (range 34-55). Two patients developed malignant TGCT de novo, while four other cases showed metachronous malignant transformation. All tumors arose in the lower extremities (3 knee, 2 thigh, 1 hip). Five patients underwent surgery for the primary tumors, and four developed local recurrence. All six patients developed lung metastases, and four of five evaluable tumors developed inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastases. All six patients received systemic therapy. Five patients were treated with at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor with inhibitory activity against CSF1R; however, only one patient showed clinical benefit (SD or PR). Five patients were treated with conventional cytotoxic agents. Doxorubicin-based treatment showed clinical benefit in all four evaluable patients, and gemcitabine/docetaxel showed clinical benefit in two patients. All six patients died of disease after a median of 21.5 months from diagnosis of malignant TGCT. Conclusions: This study confirms that TGCT may transform into an aggressive malignant tumor. Lymph node and pulmonary metastases are common. Local recurrence rates are exceedingly high. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy showed clinical benefit, whereas tyrosine kinase inhibitors against CSF1R showed limited activity. Given its rarity, a prospective registry of malignant TGCT patients is needed to further understand the entity and to develop effective strategies for systemic treatment. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug which is used to treat and prevent several dysrhythmias. This includes ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation (AF) and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone may prove to be the agent of choice where the patient is hemodynamically unstable and unsuitable for direct current (DC) cardioversion. Although, it is not recommended for long-term use. The physician might encounter issues when differentiating amiodarone-induced lung toxicity with suspicion of interstitial lung disease, cancer or vasculitis. Adverse drug reactions are difficult to confirm and it leads to serious problems of pharmacotherapy. Case presentation: A 78-year-old Caucasian male pensioner complaining of fever, dyspnea, malaise, non-productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, diagnosed with acute respiratory failure with a 16-year long history of amiodarone use and histologically confirmed temporal arteritis with long-term glucocorticosteroid (GCC) therapy. Patient was treated for temporal arteritis with GCC for ~ 1 year, then fever and dyspnea occurred, and the patient was hospitalized for treatment of bilateral pneumonia. Chest X-ray and chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) indicated several possible diagnoses: drug-induced interstitial lung disease, autoimmune interstitial lung disease, previously excluded pulmonary TB. Amiodarone was discontinued. Antibiotic therapy for bilateral pneumonia was started. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchial washings and brushings was performed. Acid fast bacilli (AFB) were found on Ziehl-Nielsen microscopy and tuberculosis (TB) was confirmed (later confirmed to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis in culture), initial treatment for TB was started. After a few months of treating for TB, patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, empiric antibiotic therapy was prescribed. After reevaluation and M. Tuberculosis identification, the patient was referred to the Tuberculosis hospital for further treatment. After 6 months of TB treatment, pneumonia occurred which was complicated by sepsis. Despite the treatment, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome evolved and patient died. Probable cause of death: pneumonia and sepsis. Conclusions: The current clinical case emphasizes issues that a physician may encounter in the differential diagnostics of amiodarone-induced lung toxicity with other lung diseases. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is closely associated with several types of malignancies. EBV is normally present in the latent state in the peripheral blood B cell compartment. The EBV latent-to-lytic switch is required for virus spread and virus-induced carinogenesis. Immunosuppression or DNA damage can induce the reactivation of EBV replication. EBV alone is rarely sufficient to cause cancer. In this study, we investigated the roles of host microRNAs and environmental factors, such as DNA-damage agents, in EBV reactivation and its association with lymphomagenesis. Methods: We first analyzed the publicly available microRNA array data containing 45 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients and 10 control lymph nodes or B cells with or without EBV infection. In situ hybridization for miR-18a and immunohistochemitry were performed to evaluate the correlation between the expression of miR-18a and nuclear EBV protein EBNA1 in lymphoid neoplasm. The proliferative effects of miR-18a were investigated in EBV-positive or -negative lymphoid neoplasm cell lines. EBV viral load was measured by a quantitative real-time EBV PCR and FISH assay. The genomic instability was evaluated by CGH-array. Results: In this study, we analyzed the publicly available microRNA array data and observed that the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster was associated with EBV status. In situ hybridization for miR-18a, which is a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, showed a significant upregulation in lymphoma samples. miR-18a, which shares the homolog sequence with EBV-encoded BART-5, promoted the proliferation of lymphoma cells in an EBV status-dependent manner. The DNA-damaging agent UV or hypoxia stress induced EBV activation, and miR-18a contributed to DNA damaging-induced EBV reactivation. In contrast to the promoting effect of ATM on the lytic EBV reactivation in normoxia, ATM inhibited lytic EBV gene expression and decreased the EBV viral load in the prescence of hypoxia-induced DNA damage. miR-18a reactivated EBV through inhibiting the ATM-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) and caused genomic instability. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate that DNA-damaging agents and host microRNAs play roles in EBV reactivation. Our study supported the interplay between host cell DDR, environmental genotoxic stress and EBV. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Context Thyroid cancer incidence increased with the greatest change in adults aged ≥65 years. Objective To determine the relationship between area-level use of imaging and thyroid cancer incidence over time. Design, Setting and Participants Longitudinal imaging patterns in Medicare patients aged ≥65 years residing in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) regions were assessed in relationship to differentiated thyroid cancer diagnosis in patients aged ≥65 years included in SEER-Medicare. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to determine factors associated with thyroid cancer incidence over time. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine patient characteristics associated with receipt of thyroid ultrasound as initial imaging. Main Outcome Measure Thyroid cancer incidence. Results Between 2002 and 2013, thyroid ultrasound use as initial imaging increased (P < 0.001). Controlling for time and demographics, use of thyroid ultrasound was associated with thyroid cancer incidence (P < 0.001). Findings persisted when cohort was restricted to papillary thyroid cancer (P < 0.001), localized papillary thyroid cancer (P = 0.004), and localized papillary thyroid cancer with tumor size ≤1 cm (P = 0.01). Based on our model, from 2003 to 2013, at least 6594 patients aged ≥65 years were diagnosed with thyroid cancer in the United States due to increased use of thyroid ultrasound. Thyroid ultrasound as initial imaging was associated with female sex and comorbidities. Conclusion Greater thyroid ultrasound use led to increased diagnosis of low-risk thyroid cancer, emphasizing the need to reduce harms through reduction in inappropriate ultrasound use and adoption of nodule risk stratification tools. © 2019 Endocrine Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The clinical significance of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) protein expression in pancreatic cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we aimed investigate the clinical significance of FGFR1 expression in pancreatic cancer. Methods: First, we investigated the relationship between FGFR pathway gene expression and clinicopathological data in three pancreatic cancer cohorts containing 313 cases. Subsequently, to confirm the findings from the discovery cohorts, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) of FGFR1 protein in a validation cohort of 205 pancreatic cancer cases. Results: In discovery cohort 1, FGFR1 and Klotho beta (KLB) overexpression was associated with low tumor stage (P < 0.05), low tumor grade (P < 0.05), and better overall survival. Multivariate analysis predicted FGFR1 (P < 0.05) as a prognostic factor for better overall survival. In discovery cohorts 2 and 3, only FGFR1 overexpression was associated with better overall survival (P < 0.05). In the validation cohort, there were 15.7% and 61% strong and weak/moderate FGFR1-positive cases, respectively. FGFR1-positive cases showed better overall survival than FGFR1-negative cases (P < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed FGFR1 positivity as an independent prognostic factor for better overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients (hazard ratio 0.677, 95% confidence interval 0.471-0.972, P = 0.035). Conclusions: FGFR1 expression, as estimated by IHC, may be used to define clinically distinct subtypes in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, FGFR1-based subclassification of pancreatic cancer may lead to new therapeutic approaches for the FGFR1-positive subtype. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Oroxylum indicum (O. indicum) has been implicated as a promising anti-cancer agent for cancer treatment including cervical cancer. It has been shown that this plant was able to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells by acting as anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) and an apoptosis inducer. The therapeutic anti-cancer properties of O. indicum is strongly postulated due to its major chemical constituents such as chrysin, oroxylin A and baicalein. In this present study, the baicalein-rich fraction was extracted to elucidate its anti-cancer activity against cervical cancer cells, SiHa (HPV 16 positive) and HeLa (HPV 18 positive) cells. Utilizing preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) (n-hexane: ethyl acetate; 50:50), this fraction was prepared from the methanolic crude extract of O. indicum and subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for baicalein quantitation. Biological activities of this fraction were tested using methylene blue assay and western blot to observe the expression of HPV oncoproteins; E6 and E7, and the tumour suppressor proteins; p53 and pRb. From the IC 50 values obtained for both SiHa and HeLa cell lines, the baicalein-rich fraction was the most potent compound compared to cisplatin and the methanol crude extract of O. indicum. After 24 hours treatment period, western blot analysis showed that MCE-and BRF-treated SiHa and HeLa cells exhibited anti-HPV effects by down-regulat-ing the expression of E6 and E7 which explain the induction of apoptosis through the up-regulation of p53 and pRb. The overall data suggested that baicalein-rich fraction from O. indicum has anti-proliferative activity and strongly induced apoptosis in treated cervical cancer cell lines via E6 and E7 repression. Therefore, baicalein isolated from O. indicum can be further exploited as a potential anti-cancer candidate for cervical cancer treatment. © 2018 Pharmascope Publications. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "High tumor heterogeneity and increased therapy resistance acquired in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment remain major obstacles to successful radiotherapy. Others and we have shown that adaptation of cancer cells to cycling severe hypoxia and intermittent reoxygenation stress (chronic-cycling hypoxia) increases cellular antioxidant capacity thereby supporting resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Here we explored the involvement of antioxidant-associated mitochondrial transport-systems for maintenance of redox-homeostasis in adaptation to chronic-cycling hypoxia and associated radioresistance. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10) or the oxoglutarate-carrier (SLC25A11) increased the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation (IR). But only targeting of SLC25A10 was effective in overcoming chronic-cycling hypoxia-induced enhanced death resistance in vitro and in vivo by disturbing increased antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, in silico analysis revealed that overexpression of SLC25A10 but not SLC25A11 is associated with reduced overall survival in lung- and breast-cancer patients. Our study reveals a role of SLC25A10 in supporting both, redox- and energy-homeostasis, ensuring radioresistance of cancer cells with tolerance to chronic-cycling hypoxia thereby proposing a novel strategy to overcome a mechanism of hypoxia-induced therapy resistance with potential clinical relevance regarding decreased patient survival. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Forkhead box F1 (FOXF1) has been recently implicated in the progression and metastasis of lung cancer and breast cancer. However, the biological functions and underlying mechanisms by which FOXF1 regulates the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) are largely unknown. As shown in our previous study, FOXF1 is upregulated in 182 CRC tissues, and elevated FOXF1 expression is significantly associated with microvessel density and advanced TNM (T = primary tumour; N = regional lymph nodes; M = distant metastasis) stages. In this study, 43 CRC tissues collected from patients who underwent treatment with first-line standard chemotherapeutic regimens in combination with bevacizumab were used to explore the correlation between FOXF1 expression and resistance to bevacizumab. In addition, FOXF1 regulated angiogenesis by inducing the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor A1 (VEGFA) in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, upregulation of FOXF1 enhanced bevacizumab resistance in CRC, and inhibition of VEGFA attenuated angiogenesis and bevacizumab resistance in FOXF1-overexpressing CRC cells. These results suggest that FOXF1 plays critical roles in CRC angiogenesis and bevacizumab resistance by inducing VEGFA transcription and that FOXF1 represents a potentially new therapeutic strategy and biomarker for anti-angiogenic therapy against CRC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Suppression of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is an important goal in the treatment of breast cancer. While several therapies directed to ALNM have been evaluated, effective and safe treatments for ALNM in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have not been established yet, especially against initial/small metastases. Here, we demonstrated the therapeutic effect of an anthracycline drug, epirubicin (EPI)-loaded polymeric micelles equipped with pH-triggered drug release property (EPI/m) against ALNM of TNBC. EPI/m effectively inhibited the spread of the primary tumor and the growth of ALNM, through selective accumulation and penetration in both primary tumor and vascularized ALNM, as well as efficient drug activation triggered by the intratumoral acidic environment. Furthermore, we revealed that the improvement of the activated drug distribution of EPI/m contributed to dose-dependent enhancement of the antitumor effect through expansion of the therapeutic window. These findings highlight the utility of pH-responsive property in EPI/m for the treatment of ALNM in TNBC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Exosomes, which are nanovesicles secreted by cells, are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, based on their specific surface protein compositions. Here, we demonstrate the correlation of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell-derived exosomes and potential protein markers by unique Raman scattering profiles and principal component analysis (PCA) for cancer diagnosis. On the basis of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals of exosomes from normal and NSCLC cells, we extracted Raman patterns of cancerous exosomes by PCA and clarified specific patterns as unique peaks through quantitative analysis with ratiometric mixtures of cancerous and normal exosomes. The unique peaks correlated well with cancerous exosome ratio (R2 &gt; 90%) as the unique Raman band of NSCLC exosome. To examine the origin of the unique peaks, we compared these unique peaks with characteristic Raman bands of several exosomal protein markers (CD9, CD81, EpCAM, and EGFR). EGFR had 1.97-fold similarity in Raman profiles than other markers, and it showed dominant expression against the cancerous exosomes in an immunoblotting result. We expect that these results will contribute to studies on exosomal surface protein markers for diagnosis of cancers. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Although the diagnostic methods and treatment options are continuously optimized, the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) are still rising. Therefore, “preventive treatment of disease” is the key to solving this problem. In recent years, hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands (CGIs) in tumor suppressor genes has been a hot research topic because it is reversible and early events in the development of CRC, and affects drug resistance, disease treatment, and patient prognosis. CRC risk factors such as poor dietary choice, lack of physical activity, excessive drinking, and unhealthy weight can regulate promoter CGI hypermethylation, which will help develop new methylation-related cancer prevention strategies. This article mainly introduces the significance and regulatory mechanism of methylation of tumor suppressor genes and its relationship with risk factors in CRC. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "The use of circulating tumor nucleic acids (ctNA) in patient liquid biopsies for targeted genetic analysis is rapidly increasing in clinical oncology. Still, the call for an integrated methodology, which is both rapid and sensitive for analyzing trace ctNA amount in liquid biopsies, has unfortunately not been fully realized. Herein, we performed complex liquid biopsy sample-to-targeted genetic analysis on a biochip with a 50 copies-detection limit within 30 min. Our biochip uniquely integrated the following: (1) electrical lysis and release of cellular targets with minimal processing; (2) nanofluidic manipulation to accelerate molecular kinetics of solid-phase isothermal amplification; and (3) single-step capture and amplification of multiple NA targets prior to nanozyme-mediated electrochemical detection. Using prostate cancer liquid biopsies, we successfully demonstrated multifunctionality for cancer risk prediction; correlation of serum and urine analyses; and cancer relapse monitoring. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Serum pepsinogen can reflect the functional status of the gastric mucosa. The pathological changes of the gastric mucosa include chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, atrophic gastritis, and gastric cancer, and the relationship between serum pepsinogen and gastric cancer/atrophic gastritis is the most prominent. Since the detection of serum pepsinogen is simple, inexpensive, time-saving, highly sensitive, and highly specific, it has attracted great attention from scholars and is regarded as “serological biopsy”. In this paper, we discuss the value of serum pepsinogen in the diagnosis of gastric diseases. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Identifying local recurrences in breast cancer from patient data sets is important for clinical research and practice. Developing a model using natural language processing and machine learning to identify local recurrences in breast cancer patients can reduce the time-consuming work of a manual chart review. Methods: We design a novel concept-based filter and a prediction model to detect local recurrences using EHRs. In the training dataset, we manually review a development corpus of 50 progress notes and extract partial sentences that indicate breast cancer local recurrence. We process these partial sentences to obtain a set of Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts using MetaMap, and we call it positive concept set. We apply MetaMap on patients' progress notes and retain only the concepts that fall within the positive concept set. These features combined with the number of pathology reports recorded for each patient are used to train a support vector machine to identify local recurrences. Results: We compared our model with three baseline classifiers using either full MetaMap concepts, filtered MetaMap concepts, or bag of words. Our model achieved the best AUC (0.93 in cross-validation, 0.87 in held-out testing). Conclusions: Compared to a labor-intensive chart review, our model provides an automated way to identify breast cancer local recurrences. We expect that by minimally adapting the positive concept set, this study has the potential to be replicated at other institutions with a moderately sized training dataset. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metabolic rewiring is an integral part of tumor growth. Among metabolic pathways, the Mevalonic-Acid-Pathway (MVAP) plays a key role in maintaining membrane architecture through cholesterol synthesis, thereby affecting invasiveness. In the current study, we show for the first time that CD133Hi pancreatic tumor initiating cells (TIC) have increased expression of MVAP enzymes, cholesterol-content and Caveolin expression. Further, we show that CD133 in these cells is localized in the lipid-rafts (characterized by Cav-1-cholesterol association). Disruption of lipid-rafts by either depleting Cav-1 or by inhibiting MVAP by lovastatin decreased metastatic-potential and chemoresistance in CD133Hi cells while not affecting the CD133lo cells. Additionally, disruption of lipid-raft results in deregulation of FAK-signaling, decreasing invasiveness in pancreatic-TICs. Furthermore, this also inhibits ABC-transporter activity resulting in sensitizing TICs to standard chemotherapeutic agents. Repurposing existing drugs for new clinical applications is one of the safest and least resource intensive approaches to improve therapeutic options. In this context, our study is extremely timely as it shows that targeting lipid-rafts with statins can sensitize the normally resistant pancreatic TICHi-cells to standard chemotherapy and decrease metastasis, thereby defining a novel strategy for targeting the TICHi-PDAC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "目的：研究吉非替尼治疗晚期非小细胞肺癌(non-small cell lung cancer，NSCLC)发生继发性耐药前后患者血清microRNA(miRNAs)表达的差异。方法：选择2013年6月至2015年6月岳阳市职业技术学院附属医院收治的4例经吉非替尼常规治疗出现获得性耐药的晚期NSCLC患者作为研究对象。收集研究对象治疗前和出现获得性耐药后的血清样本。采用miRNA芯片技术对血清样本中miRNAs表达谱进行检测，实时RT-PCR对差异性表达显著的miRNAs进行定量验证。针对筛选出的miRNAs构建抑制剂和拟似剂并转染至肺癌细胞中，检测肺癌细胞对敏感性的变化。结果：发生继发性耐药前后患者血清miRNAs表达发生明显改变。24个miRNAs在治疗前和出现获得性耐药后的NSCLC患者血清中表达具有明显的差异(表达差异≥2倍)；其中19个miRNAs在出现获得性耐药后明显上调，5个miRNAs在出现获得性耐药后明显下调，与治疗前相比差异均有统计学意义(均P<0.05)。MiR-21在出现获得性耐药后NSCLC患者的血清中的表达水平为治疗前的10倍多。RT-PCR检测miR-21的结果与miRNA芯片结果相符合。增强肺癌细胞miR-21的表达能够提高肺癌细胞对吉非替尼的半数抑制浓度(half maximal inhibitory concentration，IC50)，而抑制肺癌细胞miR-21的表达能够降低肺癌细胞对吉非替尼的IC50(均P<0.05)。结论：NSCLC经吉非替尼治疗发生耐药前后患者血清中存在差异表达的miRNAs，其中高表达的miR-21可能与吉非替尼的获得性耐药有关。.OBJECTIVE: To explore the differential expression of serum miRNAs in patients of advanced non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by gifitinib before and after acquiring drug resistance.  Methods: A total of 4 patients with advanced NSCLC from Affiliated Hospital of Yueyang Vocational Technical College, who acquired drug resistance during gefitinib therapy from June 2013 to June 2015, were enrolled. Serum samples were collected before treatment and after acquiring drug resistance. MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray was used to assess the levels and compositions of miRNAs in serum. Real-time RT-PCR was used to validate the results of miRNAs with significant differences in expression. The candidate miRNAs inhibitors and mimics were transfected into lung cancer cells by liposome, and the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to gifitinib was detected.  Results: The miRNA microarray showed that there were significantly differential expression of miRNAs in serum of NSCLC patients after acquiring drug resistance, and 24 miRNAs were changed in more than 2-fold. Among them, 19 miRNAs were up-regulated and 5 miRNAs were down- regulated (both P<0.05). Especially, the expression of miR-21 in serum of NSCLC patients after obtaining resistance was up-regulated more than 10-fold compared with that before treatment. The results of RT-PCR was consistent with the results of miRNA microarray. The up-regulation of miR-21 in lung cancer cells could elevate the half maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) of gefitinib, and the down-regulation of miR-21 in lung cancer cells could reduce the IC50 of gefitinib (both P<0.05).  Conclusion: There is differential expression of miRNAs in serum of NSCLC patients before treatment and after acquiring drug resistance during gefitinib therapy. The up-regulation of miR-21 may be involved in regulating the acquiring drug resistance of gefitinib.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To investigate near-infrared photoimmunotherapeutic effect mediated by an anti-tissue factor (TF) antibody conjugated to indocyanine green (ICG) in a pancreatic cancer model. METHODS Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a highly selective tumor treatment that utilizes an antibody-photosensitizer conjugate administration, followed by NIR light exposure. Anti-TF antibody 1849-ICG conjugate was synthesized by labeling of rat IgG2b anti-TF monoclonal antibody 1849 (anti-TF 1849) to a NIR photosensitizer, ICG. The expression levels of TF in two human pancreatic cancer cell lines were examined by western blotting. Specific binding of the 1849-ICG to TF-expressing BxPC-3 cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy. NIR-PIT-induced cell death was determined by cell viability imaging assay. In vivo longitudinal fluorescence imaging was used to explore the accumulation of 1849-ICG conjugate in xenograft tumors. To examine the effect of NIR-PIT, tumor-bearing mice were separated into 5 groups: (1) 100 μg of 1849-ICG i.v. administration followed by NIR light exposure (50 J/cm 2 ) on two consecutive days (Days 1 and 2); (2) NIR light exposure (50 J/cm 2 ) only on two consecutive days (Days 1 and 2); (3) 100 μg of 1849-ICG i.v. administration; (4) 100 μg of unlabeled anti-TF 1849 i.v. administration; and (5) the untreated control. Semiweekly tumor volume measurements, accompanied with histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of tumors, were performed 3 d after the 2 nd irradiation with NIR light to monitor the effect of treatments. RESULTS High TF expression in BxPC-3 cells was observed via western blot analysis, concordant with the observed preferential binding with intracellular localization of 1849-ICG via fluorescence microscopy. NIR-PIT-induced cell death was observed by performing cell viability imaging assay. In contrast to the other test groups, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by NIR-PIT with a statistically significant difference in relative tumor volumes for 27 d after the treatment start date [2.83 ± 0.38 (NIR-PIT) vs 5.42 ± 1.61 (Untreated), vs 4.90 ± 0.87 (NIR), vs 4.28 ± 1.87 (1849-ICG), vs 4.35 ± 1.42 (anti-TF 1849), at Day 27, P &lt; 0.05]. Tumors that received NIR-PIT showed evidence of necrotic cell death-associated features upon hematoxylin-eosin staining accompanied by a decrease in Ki-67-positive cells (a cell proliferation marker) by IHC examination. CONCLUSION The TF-targeted NIR-PIT with the 1849-ICG conjugate can potentially open a new platform for treatment of TF-expressing pancreatic cancer. © The Author(s) 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is among the most lethal malignancies. The mitotic kinase PLK1 is overexpressed in the majority of ATCs and PLK1 inhibitors have shown preclinical efficacy. However, they also cause mitotic slippage and endoreduplication, leading to the generation of tetraploid, genetically unstable cell populations. We hypothesized that PI3K activity may facilitate mitotic slippage upon PLK1 inhibition, and thus tested the effect of combining PLK1 and PI3K inhibitors in ATC models, in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with BI6727 and BKM120 resulted in a significant synergistic effect in ATC cells, independent of the levels of AKT activity. Combination of the two drugs enhanced growth suppression at doses for which the single drugs showed no effect, and led to a massive reduction of the tetraploid cells population. Furthermore, combined treatment in PI3Khigh cell lines showed a significant induction of apoptosis. Finally, combined inhibition of PI3K and PLK1 was extremely effective in vivo, in an immunocompetent allograft model of ATC. Our results demonstrate a clear therapeutic potential of combining PLK1 and PI3K inhibitors in anaplastic thyroid tumors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Imaging-guided disease theranostic nanoplatforms based on polymeric micelles have drawn a broad attention because of their clear visualization, reduced systemic toxicity, enhanced utilization of drugs, and suppressed chemoresistance of tumors, which makes them possess potential application for cancer therapy. Herein, we synthesized a polymeric nanoparticles (Poly(MAD-alt-OCE)-PTZ-PEG) with novel aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristic based on cheap commercial polymer by the simple and environmental method. These Poly(MAD-alt-OCE)-PTZ-PEG nanoparticles (NPs) show excellent biocompatibility and fluorescence property, which makes them huge application potential for cellular imaging. Furthermore, the antitumor drug cisplatin Pt(IV) can be loaded efficiently onto the surface of Poly(MAD-alt-OCE)-PTZ-PEG NPs due to the existence of abundant carboxyl groups on the NPs surface. The well-controlled Pt(IV)-loaded yield and great acid-responsive drug release of these polymeriec micelles enhance cytotoxicity against cancer cells in vitro. Given the cheap raw materials, eco-friendly method, excellent AIE property, efficient antitumor drug delivery and pH-controlled drug release, these polymeric NPs would be a potential candidate for cancer diagnosis and therapy in the future. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers have attracted increased attention as materials that can facilitate drug and gene delivery in cancer therapy. The present study reports the development of redox-sensitive dendrimersomes comprising disulfide-linked cholesterol-bearing PEGylated dendrimers, which can be used as drug and gene delivery systems. Two disulfide-linked cholesterol-bearing PEGylated generation 3 diaminobutyric polypropylenimine dendrimers have been successfully synthesized via an in situ two-step reaction. They were able to spontaneously self-assemble into stable, cationic, nanosized vesicles (or dendrimersomes) with lower critical aggregation concentration values for high-cholesterol-bearing vesicles. These dendrimersomes were able to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic dyes, and they also showed a redox-responsive sustained release of the entrapped guests in the presence of a glutathione concentration similar to that of a cytosolic reducing environment. The high-cholesterol-bearing dendrimersomes were found to have a higher melting enthalpy, increased adsorption tendency on mica surface, entrapping ability for a larger amount of hydrophobic drugs, and increased resistance to redox-responsive environments in comparison with their low-cholesterol counterpart. In addition, both dendrimersomes were able to condense more than 85% of the DNA at all the tested ratios for the low-cholesterol vesicles, and at dendrimer:DNA weight ratios of 1:1 and higher for the high-cholesterol vesicles. These vesicles resulted in an enhanced cellular uptake of DNA, by up to 15-fold when compared with naked DNA with low-cholesterol vesicles. As a result, they increased the gene transfection on the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, with the highest transfection being obtained with low-cholesterol vesicle complexes at a dendrimer:DNA weight ratio of 5:1 and high-cholesterol vesicle complexes at a dendrimer:DNA weight ratio of 10:1. These transfection levels were about 5-fold higher than those observed when treated with naked DNA. These cholesterol-bearing PEGylated dendrimer-based vesicles are, therefore, promising as redox-sensitive drugs and gene delivery systems for potential applications in combination cancer therapies. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To assess the clinical application of three-dimensional speckle tracking imaging (3DSTI) in evaluating left ventricular function in patients with gastric cancer (GC) after anthracycline chemotherapy. METHODS Thirty-five patients with GC who received anthracycline chemotherapy (ECF-L) after operation were selected as subjects (chemotherapy group). Routine echocardiography and 3DSTI were performed before and after the second, fourth, and sixth cycles of chemotherapy. The left ventricular function parameters before and after chemotherapy were compared. Meanwhile, 30 healthy volunteers were selected as a control group. RESULTS The left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global area strain (GAS) after the fourth and sixth cycles of chemotherapy in the chemotherapy group were significantly lower than those in the control group and those before and after the second cycles of chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, no significant difference was noted in left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), global circular strain (GCS), or global radial strain (GRS) in patients before and after the second, fourth, and sixth cycles of chemotherapy (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION 3DSTI can effectively monitor the early impairment of left ventricular function in GC patients after anthracycline chemotherapy, and the sensitivities of GAS and GLS parameters are higher, which can provide a reference for clinical treatment. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations in gliomas, fibrosarcoma, and other cancers leads to a novel metabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which is proposed to cause tumorigenesis. The production of this metabolite also causes vulnerabilities in cellular metabolism, such as lowering NADPH levels. To exploit this vulnerability, we treated glioma and fibrosarcoma cells that harbor an IDH1 mutation with an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) salvage pathway, FK866, and observed decreased viability in these cells. To understand the mechanism of action by which the inhibitor FK866 works, we used Raman imaging microscopy and identified that proteins and lipids are decreased upon treatment with the drug. Raman imaging showed a different distribution of lipids throughout the cell in the presence of the drug compared with the untreated cells. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to identify the classes of lipids altered. Our combined analyses point to a decrease in cell division due to loss of lipid content that contributes to membrane formation in the in vitro setting. However, the FK866 drug did not have the same potency in vivo. The use of Raman imaging microscopy indicated an opposite trend of lipid distribution in the tissue collected from treated versus untreated mice when compared with the cells. These results demonstrate the role of Raman imaging microscopy to identify and quantify metabolic changes in cancer cells and tissue.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer cells’ phenotypic plasticity, promoted by stromal cells, contributes to intra-tumoral heterogeneity and affects response to therapy. We have disclosed an association between fibroblast-stimulated phenotype switching and resistance to the clinically used BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) vemurafenib in malignant melanoma, revealing a challenge in targeting the fibroblast-induced phenotype. Here we compared molecular features and drug sensitivity in melanoma cells grown as co-cultures with fibroblasts versus mono-cultures. In the presence of fibroblasts, melanoma cells switched to the dedifferentiated, mesenchymal-like, inflammatory phenotype that showed reduced sensitivity to the most of 275 tested cancer drugs. Fibroblasts, however, sensitized melanoma cells to PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) and particularly the inhibitor of GSK3, AR-A014418 (GSK3i), that showed superior efficacy in co-cultures. The proteome changes induced by the BRAFi + GSK3i combination mimicked changes induced by BRAFi in mono-cultures, and GSK3i in co-cultures. This suggests that the single drug drives the response to the combination treatment, depending on fibroblast presence or absence, consequently, phenotype. We propose that the BRAFi and GSK3i (or PI3Ki) combination exemplifies phenotype-specific combinatorial treatment that should be beneficial in phenotypically heterogeneous tumors rich in stromal interactions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We proposed an innovative surface modification-mediated porous layer open tubular (PLOT) capillary, which was modified via an in situ biphasic reaction. This capillary comprised three-dimensional homogeneous and porous structures, which could increase the surface-area-to-volume ratio for antibody immobilization. The PLOT capillary was shown as an ideal immunoreaction base to enhance the sensitivity of immunoassays and shorten analysis time. By connecting two separate PLOT capillaries using a suitable sleeve tube, we can perform multiplex targets detection in the same sample. We developed a sensitive, rapid, and multiplex PLOT capillary-mediated immunosensor for the simultaneous identification of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in clinical serum samples with good accuracy. The detection sensitivity of the PLOT immunosensor improved by 10-fold compared with that of bare-capillary sensor, and the whole analysis could be completed within 1 h. This work suggest that suitable surface modification strategy is an effective tool to improve the analytical performance of conventional immunoassay and our study provided a feasible, sensitive, and multi-target assay for the detection of cancer biomarkers, which would be of valuable application in clinical diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Five oleanane-type triterpene glycosides including three new ones, proceraosides E-G (1-3), were isolated from a MeOH-soluble extract of Albizia procera bark. The structures of 1-3 were determined by use of NMR spectra, HRESIMS, and chemical methods. Compounds 1-5 exhibited inhibitory activities against the proliferation of the A549, SKBR3, AZ521, and HL60 human cancer cell lines (IC 50 0.28-1.8 μM). Additionally, the apoptosis-inducing activity of compound 2 was evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry, while the effects of 2 on the activation of caspases-9, -8, and -3 in HL60 cells were revealed by Western blot analysis. © 2018 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

    "Abstract": "Context Two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), lenvatinib and vandetanib, are often used to treat advanced radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), respectively. Fatigue is a common adverse event during treatment with these and other TKIs and a common cause of drug discontinuation or dosage reduction. Cases Description We evaluated the basal and stimulated adrenal function in 12 patients with advanced RAI-R DTC and MTC treated with lenvatinib or vandetanib, respectively. Ten patients complaining of fatigue showed a progressive ACTH increase with normal cortisol levels. Moreover, six of 10 patients had a blunted cortisol response after ACTH stimulation, thus confirming the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). The causal relationship between TKIs and PAI onset was also demonstrated by the repeated testing of adrenal function before and during treatment. Patients with PAI received cortisone acetate replacement therapy, with a substantial and prompt improvement in the degree of fatigue, as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, thus supporting the major impact of impaired adrenal function in the genesis of this adverse event. Conclusions We show that the occurrence of PAI may be a common cause of fatigue during lenvatinib and vandetanib treatment, and we therefore recommend testing adrenal function for a prompt start of replacement therapy to avoid treatment discontinuation, dosage reduction, and potentially severe PAI complications. © 2019 Endocrine Society.",

    "Abstract": "Context There has been concern that GH treatment of children might increase meningioma risk. Results of published studies have been inconsistent and limited. Objective To examine meningioma risks in relation to GH treatment. Design Cohort study with follow-up via cancer registries and other registers. Setting Population-based. Patients A cohort of 10,403 patients treated in childhood with recombinant GH in five European countries since this treatment was first used in 1984. Expected rates from national cancer registration statistics. Main Outcome Measures Risk of meningioma incidence. Results During follow-up, 38 meningiomas occurred. Meningioma risk was greatly raised in the cohort overall [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 75.4; 95% CI: 54.9 to 103.6], as a consequence of high risk in subjects who had received radiotherapy for underlying malignancy (SIR = 658.4; 95% CI: 460.4 to 941.7). Risk was not significantly raised in patients who did not receive radiotherapy. Risk in radiotherapy-Treated patients was not significantly related to mean daily dose of GH, duration of GH treatment, or cumulative dose of GH. Conclusions Our data add to evidence of very high risk of meningioma in patients treated in childhood with GH after cranial radiotherapy, but suggest that GH may not affect radiotherapy-related risk, and that there is no material raised risk of meningioma in GH-Treated patients who did not receive radiotherapy. © 2019 Endocrine Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In precision medicine, scarcity of suitable biological data often hinders the design of an appropriate predictive model. In this regard, large scale pharmacogenomics studies, like CCLE and GDSC hold the promise to mitigate the issue. However, one cannot directly employ data from multiple sources together due to the existing distribution shift in data. One way to solve this problem is to utilize the transfer learning methodologies tailored to fit in this specific context. Results: In this paper, we present two novel approaches for incorporating information from a secondary database for improving the prediction in a target database. The first approach is based on latent variable cost optimization and the second approach considers polynomial mapping between the two databases. Utilizing CCLE and GDSC databases, we illustrate that the proposed approaches accomplish a better prediction of drug sensitivities for different scenarios as compared to the existing approaches. Conclusion: We have compared the performance of the proposed predictive models with database-specific individual models as well as existing transfer learning approaches. We note that our proposed approaches exhibit superior performance compared to the abovementioned alternative techniques for predicting sensitivity for different anti-cancer compounds, particularly the nonlinear mapping model shows the best overall performance. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite great progress in photodynamic therapy (PDT), the therapeutic effect is still limited by some points, such as tumor hypoxia, the short lifetime and the limited action region of 1 O 2 . Herein, a special kind of three-dimensional dendritic mesoporous silica nanosphere (3D-dendritic MSN) was synthesized and used as a robust nanocarrier to deliver abundant hydrophobic photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) to the A549 lung cancer cells. To address the tumor hypoxia issue, the nanozyme Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) were immobilized onto the channels of 3D-dendritic MSNs to catalyze the conversion of intracellular H 2 O 2 to oxygen. Moreover, due to the in situ reduction process, the uniform Pt NPs distributed well on the surface of 3D-dendritic MSNs with high homogeneous dispersity. Additionally, a mitochondria-targeting ligand, triphenylphosphine (TPP), was conjugated to the Pt-decorated 3D-dendritic MSN composites to form a mitochondria targeted system for the PDT. In a combination of the peroxidase-like Pt NPs with mitochondria-targeting ability of TPP, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst in the mitochondria was achieved and resulted in the cell apoptosis. This well-designed system shows an enhanced PDT effect of killing A549 cells, and promotes a new H 2 O 2 -activatable strategy to overcome hypoxia for tumor PDT. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "目的：探讨黑斑息肉综合征(Peutz-Jeghers syndrome，PJS)的临床特点、病理特征、基因检测结果、诊断治疗及预后。方法：对2007—2017年收治的46例PJS患者的临床资料进行回顾性分析。 结果：46例患者均存在口唇黏膜黑斑及消化道多发息肉，黑斑多于5岁以内出现，14例有家族史。临床上表现为黑斑、腹痛、便血、贫血等。病理学检查可表现为错构瘤(20例)、腺瘤(18例)、炎性息肉(14例)及锯齿状息肉(10例)等。11例患者行遗传性结直肠癌易感基因(20个)检测，结果提示5例有丝/苏氨酸蛋白激酶(serine/threonine kinase 11，STK11)基因突变，其中3例STK11基因致病证据明确者均有肠套叠及外科手术史。治疗以内镜下微创为主，出现并发症及息肉过大时行内镜和腹腔镜联合或外科手术治疗。随访发现3例患者发生恶性肿瘤。结论：PJS以特殊部位的皮肤、黏膜黑斑和消化道多发息肉为特征。病理学表现以错构瘤及腺瘤多见。STK11基因致病证据明确者发生肠套叠及外科手术风险较大。PJS早期治疗以内镜下微创为主，因增加恶性肿瘤风险，容易复发，应密切随访。.OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical features, pathological features, gene test results, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome(PJS).  Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 46 hospitalized cases of PJS during 2007 and 2017.  Results: All 46 patients had mucocutaneous melanin pigmentation and multiple gastrointestinal polyposis. The pigmentation was first noticed often within 5 years old, and 14 cases had family history. The clinical manifestations mainly included black spots, abdominal pain, hematochezia, and anemia. Histological examinations showed that 20 patients were classified as hamartomatous polyps,18 as adenomatous polyps, 14 as inflammatory polyps, and 10 as zigzag polyps. Eleven patients sequenced a panel of 20 genes previously associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) by next-generation sequencing, and the results showed 5 patients with gene mutations, and 3 of them with intussusception and surgical histories were found to have pathogenic germline mutations in the STK11 gene. Endoscopic treatment was the main therapy, but endoscopy combined with laparoscopy or surgical treatment was performed when complications occurred or the polyp was too large. Malignant tumors were found in 3 patients during follow-up.  Conclusion: PJS is a hereditary disease which is characterized by spots of the skin or mucosa and gastrointestinal multiple polyps. The main pathological features are hamartoma and adenoma. The risks for intussusception and surgical operation are found to be high in the patients with pathogenic germline mutations in the STK11 gene. Endoscopic treatment is the main therapy. PJS patients should be followed up regularly due to the increasing risk for cancer and being easily to relapse.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered as promising cancer biomarkers. However, the simple but sensitive detection of low levels of miRNAs in biological samples still remains challenging. Herein, we wish to report an entirely enzyme-free, simple, and highly sensitive miRNA assay based on the counting of cycling click chemical ligation (3CL)-illuminated fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). In this strategy, each miRNA molecule can trigger many cycles of click chemical ligation reactions to produce plentiful ligated oligonucleotides (ODNs) with both 5′-biotin and 3′-fluorophore, resulting in efficient signal amplification. It is worth noting that only the ligated ODNs can bring fluorophores onto streptavidin-functionalized MNPs (STV-MNPs). Notably, merely 10 fluorescent molecules on each 50 nm MNP can make it bright enough to be clearly visualized by the TIRFM, which can significantly improve the detection sensitivity for miRNA. Through fluorescence counting of individual MNPs and integrating their fluorescence intensities, the amount of target miRNA can be quantitatively determined. This miRNA assay can be accomplished in a mix-and-read manner just by simply mixing the enzyme-free 3CL reaction system with the MNPs before TIRFM imaging, which avoids tedious immobilization, washing, and purification steps. Despite the extremely simple operation, this strategy exhibits high sensitivity with a quite low detection limit of 50 fM target miRNA as well as high specificity to well discriminate miRNA sequences with a single-base variation. Furthermore, the applicability of this method in real biological samples is also verified through the accurate detection of the miRNA target in cancer cells. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma with intracranial infiltrative growth remains an incurable disease mainly owing to existence of blood brain barrier (BBB) and off-target drug toxicity. RNA interference (RNAi) with a high specificity and low toxicity emerges as a new treatment modality for glioblastoma. The clinical application of RNAi technology is, however, hampered by the absence of safe and brain-targeting transfection agents. Here, we report on angiopep-2 peptide-decorated chimaeric polymersomes (ANG-CP) as a nontoxic and brain-targeting non-viral vector to boost the RNAi therapy for human glioblastoma in vivo. ANG-CP shows excellent packaging and protection of anti-PLK1 siRNA (siPLK1) in its lumen while quickly releasing payloads in a cytoplasmic reductive environment. Notably, in vitro experiments demonstrate that ANG-CP can effectively permeate the bEnd.3 monolayer, transport siRNA into the cytosol of U-87 MG glioblastoma cells via the LRP-1-mediated pathway, and significantly silence PLK1 mRNA and corresponding oncoprotein in U-87 MG cells. ANG-CP greatly prolongs the siPLK1 circulation time and enhances its accumulation in glioblastoma. RNAi with siPLK1 induces a strong anti-glioblastoma effect and significantly improves the survival time of glioblastoma carrying mice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Efficient delivery of anticancer drugs into tumor tissues at maximally effective and minimally toxic concentrations is vital for therapeutic success. At present, no method exists that can predict the spatial and temporal distribution of drugs into a target tissue after administration of a specific dose. This prevents accurate estimation of optimal dosage regimens for cancer therapy. Here we present a new method that predicts quantitatively the time-dependent spatial distribution of drugs in tumor tissues at sub-micrometer resolution. This is achieved by modeling the diffusive flow of individual drug molecules through the three-dimensional network of blood-vessels that vascularize the tumor, and into surrounding tissues, using molecular mechanics techniques. By evaluating delivery into tumors supplied by a series of blood-vessel networks with varying degrees of complexity, we show that the optimal dose depends critically on the precise vascular structure. Finally, we apply our method to calculate the optimal dosage of the cancer drug doxil into a section of a mouse ovarian tumor, and demonstrate the enhanced delivery of liposomally administered doxorubicin when compared to free doxorubicin. Comparison with experimental data and a multiple-compartment model show that the model accurately recapitulates known pharmacokinetics and drug-load predictions. In addition, it provides, for the first time, a detailed picture of the spatial dependence of drug uptake into tissues surrounding tumor vasculatures. This approach is fundamentally different to current continuum models, and reveals that the target tumor vascular topology is as important for therapeutic success as the transport properties of the drug delivery platform itself. This sets the stage for revisiting drug dosage calculations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In present study, gene concentrated as well as bioreduction-ruptured nanogel with local enrichment positive charge while low cytotoxicity was developed for Bcl2 siRNA delivery featured in intracellular switch on/off controlled release. Dynamic covalent bond crosslinked nanogel was formed by thiolated PEI of 1.8 kDa(PEI-1.8 kDa)and biodegradable dextrin. Once nanogel was uptake by tumor cells, high concentration of glutathione (GSH) in cytosol could bioreducible -degrade and rupture the crosslink of this dextrin nanogel (DSP) into hypotoxic PEI-1.8 kDa and dextrin, following by burst release of packed siRNA and minimizing the restriction of polymer material for siRNA transcription. This switch on/off siRNA release strategy for gene therapy exhibited equal level of the deregulation of Bcl2 protein expression determined by western blot analysis compared with cationic PEI with 25 kDa molecular weight (PEI-25 kDa) in vitro. Moreover, the gene concentrated DSP based on hypotoxic PEI-1.8 kDa and biodegradable dextrin could be administrated intravenously for systematic therapy on safely. Tumor suppression study of DSP also exhibited a superior antitumor activity in 4T1-luc tumor cell bearing BALB/C mice. Furthermore, it exhibited lower cytotoxicity, almost none hemotoxicity, moreover avoiding recognition and clearance by RES system in healthy mice. Overall, these findings suggest that this reduction-sensitive while bioreduction-ruptured polymer nanogel is an innovative strategy and holds great promise for gene and drug delivery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Melonoside B (1) and melonosins B (2) and A (3), new lipids based on polyoxygenated fatty acid amides, and known melonoside A (4) were isolated from two different collections of the marine sponge Melonanchora kobjakovae. The structures of these compounds, including their absolute configurations, were established using detailed analysis of 1D and 2D NMR, ECD, and mass spectra as well as chemical transformations. Melonosins 2 and 3 inhibit AP-1- and NF-kB-dependent transcriptional activities in JB6 Cl41 cells at noncytotoxic concentrations, demonstrating potential cancer preventive activity. © 2018 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

    "Abstract": "A new cyclic lipodepsipeptide, fusaristatin C (1), was obtained from the fungus Pithomyces sp. RKDO 1698, which was isolated from the Caribbean octocoral Eunicea fusca. The 2D structure of fusaristatin C was elucidated using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, while the absolute configuration of the sole chiral amino acid residue (l-serine) was determined using Marfey's method. 3-Hydroxy-2,11-dimethyltetradecanoic acid (HDMT) was cleaved from 1, and the absolute configuration at the C-3 position was determined using Mosher's ester analysis. Subsequent J-based configuration analysis of 1 allowed for assignment of the C-2 configuration.

    "Abstract": "(±)-Cryptomeriolide, a pair of racemic bis-seco-abietane diterpenoids, were isolated from the bark of Cryptomeria fortunei. The separation of enantiomers was achieved by using chiral stationary phase HPLC. Their structures including the absolute configuration and conformations in solution and solid state were determined by extensive analysis of spectroscopic data, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and comparison of calculated and experimental electronic circular dichroism data. A bioinspired one-pot enantiomeric synthesis of 1a and 1b was accomplished via a readily made intermediate orthoquinone from sugiol. All compounds including the synthetic intermediates were assayed for their cytotoxic activities on human cancer cell lines HL-60, A549, and SGC7901. © 2018 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

    "Abstract": "We developed a single-molecule homogeneous immunoassay by counting spatially \"overlapping\" two-color quantum dots (QD) under a wide-field fluorescence microscope. QD 655 with red fluorescence and QD 565 with green fluorescence were modified with capture and detection antibodies, respectively. A capture antibody-modified QD 655 and a detection antibody-modified QD 565 were conjugated by a corresponding antigen molecule to form a \"sandwich\" immunocomplex. The conjugated QD 655 could not be distinguished from the conjugated QD 565 by fluorescent microscopy because the distance between them was smaller than the resolution of an optical microscope (approximately 200 nm). The immunocomplex color became yellow because of the spatial \"overlap\" of the red and green fluorescence. The number of the yellow spots was equal to the number of immunocomplex molecules, while the concentration of the antigen was related to the ratio of the yellow dots to the red dots. The successful quantification of two model proteins in the human plasma, namely, alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen, demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of our approach. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have considerable clinical significance in cancer progression and prognosis. In this context, CTC-derived microRNAs (miRs) in blood and tissues have been proposed as the novel noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring tumor progression, especially at the early stages. To monitor circulating miRs, a tool should have high sensitivity, be a simple procedure, and allow detection in very small volumes. Thus, we designed a sensing tool for sensitive monitoring of blood or tissue miRs using a fluorophore-quencher probe-based molecular beacon (MB). This MB-based tool displayed an ultrasensitive limit of detection (LOD) level of 6.7 × 10 -17 M and 8.7 × 10 -17 for metastasis-derived miR-21a and miR-221, respectively. It also can discriminate miR-21a/221 from both guide strand miRs and its precursor forms (pre-miR). Furthermore, the tool discriminated between blood and tissue-related miR-21a/221-expression and detected metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition and also describe a noninvasive miR fluorescence imaging of CTCs in a mouse model, showing the potential for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Overcoming the efflux mediated by ATP–binding cassette (ABC) transporters at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a challenge for the delivery of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib to the brain. Inhibition of ABCB1 and ABCG2 at the mouse BBB improved the BBB permeation of erlotinib but could not be achieved in humans. BBB disruption induced by focused ultrasound (FUS) was investigated as a strategy to overcome the efflux transport of erlotinib in vivo. In rats, FUS combined with microbubbles allowed for a large and spatially controlled disruption of the BBB in the left hemisphere. ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibition was performed using elacridar (10 mg/kg i.v). The brain kinetics of erlotinib was studied using 11C-erlotinib Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging in 5 groups (n = 4–5 rats per group) including a baseline group, immediately after sonication (FUS), 48 h after FUS (FUS + 48 h), elacridar (ELA) and their combination (FUS + ELA). BBB integrity was assessed using the Evan's Blue (EB) extravasation test. Brain exposure to 11C-erlotinib was measured as the area under the curve (AUC) of the brain kinetics (% injected dose (%ID) versus time (min)) in volumes corresponding to the disrupted (left) and the intact (right) hemispheres, respectively. EB extravasation highlighted BBB disruption in the left hemisphere of animals of the FUS and FUS + ELA groups but not in the control and ELA groups. EB extravasation was not observed 48 h after FUS suggesting recovery of BBB integrity. Compared with the control group (AUCBaseline = 1.4 ± 0.5%ID.min), physical BBB disruption did not impact the brain kinetics of 11C-erlotinib in the left hemisphere (p &gt;.05) either immediately (AUCFUS = 1.2 ± 0.1%ID.min) or 48 h after FUS (AUCFUS+48h = 1.1 ± 0.3%ID.min). Elacridar similarly increased 11C-erlotinib brain exposure to the left hemisphere in the absence (AUCELA = 2.2 ± 0.5%ID.min, p &lt;.001) and in the presence of BBB disruption (AUCFUS+ELA = 2.1 ± 0.5%ID.min, p &lt;.001). AUCleft was never significantly different from AUCright (p &gt;.05), in any of the tested conditions. BBB integrity is not the rate limiting step for erlotinib delivery to the brain which is mainly governed by ABC-mediated efflux. Efflux transport of erlotinib persisted despite BBB disruption. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Noble metallic nanoparticles with unique plasmonic properties are useful in a variety of applications including bio-imaging, sensing, cancer therapy, etc. The properties of metallic nanoparticles can be tuned in multiple ways, among which laser welding is a highly efficient method. In this study, laser-induced inter-welding of Ag-Au nanoparticle (NP) dimers was investigated using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). For the first time, the welding process was directly visualized. The structural and compositional evolution of Ag-Au dimers was studied in detail, and several typical nanostructures formed during the welding process, including two types of core-shell structures, were discovered. Based on these observations, we proposed a complete mechanism explaining how welding proceeds under the influence of a laser. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrated that the plasmonic properties of welded Ag-Au dimers were different from those of pure Au-Au or Ag-Ag dimers and can be tuned by forming shells, alloying or changing the size ratio of Ag and Au NPs. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "目的：探讨利用人工神经网络对脑胶质瘤进行分级的可行性和有效性。方法：回顾性纳入2012至2017年经病理证实的130例脑胶质瘤患者，基于磁共振增强T1加权相二维图像提取的共41个影像学特征。建立人工神经网络并进行特征选择以得到最优化的神经网络模型，随机抽取一半病例的影像学特征数据对神经网络进行训练，并用另一半特征数据对训练完成后的神经网络进行胶质瘤分级效果验证。对神经网络重复进行100次训练和验证，将结果进行平均。结果：经过特征选择后的神经网络模型共选取5个特征作为输入特征，神经网络对脑胶质瘤分级的平均准确率为90.32%，平均敏感度为87.86%，平均特异度为92.49%，受试者操作曲线的曲线下面积为0.9486。结论：人工神经网络作为一种人工智能方法，对脑胶质瘤分级具有较高的准确性，为脑胶质瘤的无创性术前分级提供了可行的辅助手段。.OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility and efficacy of artificial neural network for differentiating high-grade glioma and low-grade glioma using image information.  Methods: A total of 130 glioma patients with confirmed pathological diagnosis were selected retrospectively from 2012 to 2017. Forty one imaging features were extracted from each subjects based on 2-dimension magnetic resonance T1 weighted imaging with contrast-enhancement. An artificial neural network model was created and optimized according to the performance of feature selection. The training dataset was randomly selected half of the whole dataset, and the other half dataset was used to verify the performance of the neural network for glioma grading. The training-verification process was repeated for 100 times and the performance was averaged.  Results: A total of 5 imaging features were selected as the ultimate input features for the neural network. The mean accuracy of the neural network for glioma grading was 90.32%, with a mean sensitivity at 87.86% and a mean specificity at 92.49%. The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9486.  Conclusion: As a technique of artificial intelligence, neural network can reach a relatively high accuracy for the grading of glioma and provide a non-invasive and promising computer-aided diagnostic process for the pre-operative grading of glioma.",

    "Abstract": "Context Early cancer detection is critical to optimize treatment. This is particularly problematic in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which exhibit an â 1/45-year diagnostic delay due to covert symptoms, limitations in imaging, and circulating biomarkers. Despite development of continuous monitoring strategies utilizing advanced modalities [CT/MRI or 68 Gallium positron emission tomography (PET)/CT] or a repertoire of monoanalyte biomarkers [e.g., chromogranin A (CgA), pancreastatin, serotonin], detection of minimal residual disease or microrecurrence remains elusive. Emerging molecular liquid biopsies (e.g., NETest) provide a substantially improved threshold for disease detection. Case Description We describe the utility of a blood-based multigene PCR neuroendocrine measurement (NETest), which is representative of core molecular drivers of neuroendocrine tumorigenesis, to detect hepatic micrometastases in a patient with negative blood biomarkers and negative anatomical/functional imaging. The 52-year-old woman, who had undergone margin-negative resection for a NET of the ileocecal valve, developed persistently elevated NETest levels 8 months later. CT/MRI/ 68 Gallium PET and biomarkers remained negative. Blood multigene analysis identified disease, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) was undertaken. Over 9 months, NETest levels increased (conventional biomarkers/imaging remained normal). Liver biopsy was undertaken, and foci of a 3-mm NET in segment VI were histologically documented. At 3.3 years after PRRT, the disease remained as a microscopic burden and stable biomarker/ 68 Gallium PET/MRI occult despite elevated blood levels of NET genes. Conclusions Blood measurement of NET transcripts can identify image-and CgA-negative disease. A NET liquid biopsy strategy has clinical utility in the early identification of residual or metastatic disease and optimizes consideration of adjuvant therapeutic intervention. © 2019 Endocrine Society.",

However, the construction of the self-replication system in vitro remains a great challenge and its application for biosensing is rare. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the construction of an in vitro enzymatic nucleic acid self-replication system and its application for amplified sensing of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) based on autocatalytic self-replication-driven cascaded recycling amplification. In this strategy, hOGG1 excises 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) to unfold the hairpin substrate, activating the autonomous biocatalytic process with molecular beacons (MBs) as both the fuels for producing nucleic acid templates and the generators for signal output, leading to the continuous replication of biocatalytic nucleic acid templates and the repeated cleavage of MBs for an enhanced fluorescence signal. This strategy exhibits an extremely low detection limit of 4.3 × 10 -7 U/μL and a large dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude from 1 × 10 -6 to 0.05 U/μL. Importantly, it can be applied for the detection of enzyme kinetic parameters, the screening of hOGG1 inhibitors, and the quantification of hOGG1 activity in even 1 single lung cancer cell, providing a new approach for biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs) offer new solutions for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. However, the anti-tumor effect has not been greatly improved. Tumors are easily spread through the lymphatic system while the traditional NPs (~100 nm) can hardly reach lymph nodes for the treatment of metastasis. In addition, the NPs with fixed particle size cannot achieve efficient “penetration” and long-term “retention” simultaneously. Herein, we established “transformable” micelles modified with azide/alkyne groups for click chemical reaction. Not surprisingly, the small micelles (~25 nm) could effectively target lymph nodes, limiting the growth of the metastases associated with their size-regulated abilities to extravasate from the vasculature. Tumor lymph node metastasis dropped by 66.7%. After reaching primary tumors, cycloaddition reaction occurred between groups on micelles, resulting in the formation of aggregates. The strategy resulted in improved retention of the micelles in 4 T1 cells both in vitro and in vivo owing to the decreasing of nanoparticle exocytosis and minimizing the backflow to the bloodstream. Enhanced cytotoxicity on 4 T1 cells and improved antitumor efficacy were also observed. S-PTX (+) exhibited 76.23% tumor suppression, and tumor mass at the end of the treatment also showed the best tumor inhibitory effect. In conclusion, this drug delivery system provides a strategy for effective treatment of the primary tumor and lymphatic metastasis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "S100B, a member of the multigene family of Ca 2+ -binding proteins, is overexpressed by most malignant gliomas but its biological role in gliomagenesis is unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that low concentrations of S100B attenuated microglia activation through the induction of STAT3. Furthermore, S100B downregulation in a murine glioma model inhibited macrophage trafficking and tumor growth. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that S100B inhibitors may have antiglioma properties through modulation of tumor microenvironment. To discover novel S100B inhibitors, we developed a high-throughput screening cell-based S100B promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay. Initial screening of 768 compounds in the NIH library identified 36 hits with &gt;85% S100B inhibitory activity. Duloxetine (Dul, an SNRI) was selected for the initial proof-of-concept studies. At low concentrations (1–5 μM) Dul inhibited S100B and CCL2 production in mouse GL261 glioma cells, but had minimal cytotoxic activity in vitro. In vivo, however, Dul (30 mg/kg/14 days) inhibited S100B production, altered the polarization and trafficking of tumor-associated myeloid-derived cells, and inhibited the growth of intracranial GL261 gliomas. Dul therapeutic efficacy, however, was not observed in the K-Luc glioma model that expresses low levels of S100B. These findings affirm the role of S100B in gliomagenesis and justify the development of more potent S100B inhibitors for glioma therapy. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells population has been successfully isolated from the matrix and characterised for its stemness properties. Endothelial cells from the vein of the umbilical cord which are usually termed as HUVEC are also of interest to researchers as it can be manipulated in vitro to study endothelial cells behaviour and vascular-associated diseases. Immunophenotyping for positive and negative markers of mesenchymal stem cells was performed on HUVEC and compared to the closest stem cells that were isolated from the umbilical cord matrix which is termed as HUCMSC in this study. The expressions of a set of stemness genes were also detected using qPCR. The results showed that HUVEC strongly expressed hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells markers (CD31, CD34, CD9, CD44, CD73 and CD90) while HUCMSC possess mesenchymal stem cells properties with strong expression of CD9, CD44, CD73 and CD90. Interestingly, the expression of stemness genes is detected higher in HUVEC compared to HUCMSC with possibilities of having neural properties as evidenced by the high expression of FGF4, FZD9, Nestin and SOX2. Thus, it is suggested that HUVEC exhibited some stem cells characteristics and could be further investigated for possible application in research as well as in future cells therapy. © 2018 Pharmascope Publications.

    "Abstract": "Background: Melanoma aggressiveness determines its growth and metastatic potential. This study aimed at identifying new molecular pathways controlling melanoma cell malignancy. Methods: Ten metastatic melanoma cell lines were characterized by their proliferation, migration and invasion capabilities. The most representative cells were also characterized by spheroid formation assay, gene- and protein- expression profiling as well as cytokines secretion and the most relevant pathways identified through bioinformatic analysis were tested by in silico transcriptomic validation on datasets generated from biopsies specimens of melanoma patients. Further, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) activity was tested by zymography assays and TNF-alpha role was validated by anti-TNF cell-treatment. Results: An aggressiveness score (here named Melanoma AGgressiveness Score: MAGS) was calculated by measuring proliferation, migration, invasion and cell-doubling time in10human melanoma cell lines which were clustered in two distinct groups, according to the corresponding MAGS. SK-MEL-28 and A375 cell lines were selected as representative models for the less and the most aggressive phenotype, respectively. Gene-expression and protein expression data were collected for SK-MEL-28 and A375 cells by Illumina-, multiplex x-MAP-and mass-spectrometry technology. The collected data were subjected to an integrated Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, which highlighted that cytokine/chemokine secretion, as well as Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction functions as well as matrix metalloproteases activity were significantly different in these two cell types. The key role of these pathways was then confirmed by functional validation. TNF role was confirmed by exposing cells to the anti-TNF Infliximab antibody. Upon such treatment melanoma cells aggressiveness was strongly reduced. Metalloproteases activity was assayed, and their role was confirmed by comparing transcriptomic data from cutaneous melanoma patients (n = 45) and benign nevi (n = 18). Conclusions: Inflammatory signals such as TNF and MMP-2 activity are key intrinsic players to determine melanoma cells aggressiveness suggesting new venue sin the identification of novel molecular targets with potential therapeutic relevance. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: In genomic studies, to investigate how the structure of a genetic network differs between two experiment conditions is a very interesting but challenging problem, especially in high-dimensional setting. Existing literatures mostly focus on differential network modelling for continuous data. However, in real application, we may encounter discrete data or mixed data, which urges us to propose a unified differential network modelling for various data types. Results: We propose a unified latent Gaussian copula differential network model which provides deeper understanding of the unknown mechanism than that among the observed variables. Adaptive rank-based estimation approaches are proposed with the assumption that the true differential network is sparse. The adaptive estimation approaches do not require precision matrices to be sparse, and thus can allow the individual networks to contain hub nodes. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed methods achieve the same parametric convergence rate for both the difference of the precision matrices estimation and differential structure recovery, which means that the extra modeling flexibility comes at almost no cost of statistical efficiency. Besides theoretical analysis, thorough numerical simulations are conducted to compare the empirical performance of the proposed methods with some other state-of-the-art methods. The result shows that the proposed methods work quite well for various data types. The proposed method is then applied on gene expression data associated with lung cancer to illustrate its empirical usefulness. Conclusions: The proposed latent variable differential network models allows for various data-types and thus are more flexible, which also provide deeper understanding of the unknown mechanism than that among the observed variables. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and real application all demonstrate the great advantages of the latent differential network modelling and thus are highly recommended. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI) is a 14-amino-acid bicyclic peptide that contains a single internal disulfide bond. We initially constructed chimeras of SFTI with N-terminal secretion signals from the Escherichia coli OmpA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ToxA, but only detected small amounts of protease inhibition resulting from these constructs. A substantially higher degree of protease inhibition was detected from a C-terminal SFTI fusion with E. coli YebF, which radiated more than a centimeter from an individual colony of E. coli using a culture-based inhibitor assay. Inhibitory activity was further improved in YebF-SFTI fusions by the addition of a trypsin cleavage signal immediately upstream of SFTI, and resulted in production of a 14-amino-acid, disulfide-bonded SFTI free in the culture supernatant. To assess the potential of the secreted SFTI to protect the ability of a cytotoxic protein to kill tumor cells, we utilized a tumor-selective form of the Pseudomonas ToxA (OTG-PE38K) alone and expressed as a polycistronic construct with YebF-SFTI in the tumor-targeted Salmonella VNP20009. When we assessed the ability of toxin-containing culture supernatants to kill MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, the untreated OTG-PE38K was able to eliminate all detectable tumor cells, while pretreatment with trypsin resulted in the complete loss of anticancer cytotoxicity. However, when OTG-PE38K was co-expressed with YebF-SFTI, cytotoxicity was completely retained in the presence of trypsin. These data demonstrate SFTI chimeras are secreted in a functional form and that co-expression of protease inhibitors with therapeutic proteins by tumor-targeted bacteria has the potential to enhance the activity of therapeutic proteins by suppressing their degradation within a proteolytic environment. © 2018 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) functions as an immune checkpoint in the process of anti-tumor immune response. The PD-1 blockade is now becoming a fundamental part in cancer immunotherapy. So it's essential to elicit the PD-1 related immune process in different types of cancer. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to collect the RNA-seq data of 33 cancer types. The microenvironment cell populations-counter was used to analyze the immune cell infiltrates. KEGG and GO analysis were performed to investigate PD-1 associated biological process. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox's proportional hazards model were performed for prognostic value analysis. Results: We demonstrated that PD-1 expression varied in different cancer types. The uveal melanoma had a low PD-1 expression and poor infiltrated with immune cells. But it showed the strong correlation of PD-1 with the most types of immune cells. The PD-1 demonstrated a robust relationship with other immunomodulators and showed its involvement in critical functions correlated with anti-tumor immune pathways. Survival analysis indicated the PD-1 expression suggested different prognosis in different cancer types. Conclusions: Our investigations promote a better understanding of the PD-1 blockade and provide PD-1 related personized combined immunotherapy for different types of cancer patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Personalized medicine for patients receiving radiation therapy remains an elusive goal due, in part, to the limits in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing tumor response to radiation. The purpose of this study was to develop a kinetic model, in the context of locally advanced lung cancer, connecting cancer cell subpopulations with tumor volumes measured during the course of radiation treatment for understanding treatment outcome for individual patients. Methods: The kinetic model consists of three cell compartments: cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), non-stem tumor cells (TCs) and dead cells (DCs). A set of ordinary differential equations were developed to describe the time evolution of each compartment, and the analytic solution of these equations was iterated to be aligned with the day-to-day tumor volume changes during the course of radiation treatment. A least squares fitting method was used to estimate the parameters of the model that include the proportion of CSCs and their radio-sensitivities. This model was applied to five patients with stage III lung cancer, and tumor volumes were measured from 33 cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images for each of these patients. The analytical solution of these differential equations was compared with numerically simulated results. Results: For the five patients with late stage lung cancer, the derived proportions of CSCs are 0.3 on average, the average probability of the symmetry division is 0.057 and the average surviving fractions of CSCs is 0.967, respectively. The derived parameters are comparable to the results from literature and our experiments. The preliminary results suggest that the CSC self-renewal rate is relatively small, compared to the proportion of CSCs for locally advanced lung cancers. Conclusions: A novel mathematical model has been developed to connect the population of cancer stem-like cells with tumor volumes measured from a sequence of CBCT images. This model may help improve our understanding of tumor response to radiation therapy, and is valuable for development of new treatment regimens for patients with locally advanced lung cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Despite the high prevalence of insomnia in patients with advanced cancer, there are no randomized controlled trials on pharmacological interventions for insomnia in this group of patients. A variety of pharmacological agents is recommended to manage sleep disturbance for insomnia in the general population, but their efficacy and safety in adults with advanced cancer are not established. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of medications for insomnia in order to improve the evidence in patients with advanced cancer. One of the most used sleep medications at present in patients with cancer is zopiclone. Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial. A total of 100 patients with metastatic cancer who report insomnia will be randomly allocated to zopiclone or placebo. The treatment duration with zopiclone/placebo is 6 consecutive nights. The primary endpoint is patient-reported sleep quality during the final study night (night 6) assessed on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, where 0 = Best sleep and 10 = Worst possible sleep. Secondary endpoints include the mean patient-reported total sleep time and sleep onset latency during the final study night (night 6). Discussion: Results from this study on treatment of insomnia in advanced cancer will contribute to clinical decision-making and improve the treatment of sleep disturbance in this patient cohort.

    "Abstract": "Background: Estrogen receptor (ER) expression is important for treatment selection and prognostication of breast cancer patients. Although the metastases are the main targets of endocrine therapy, ER status is often based on the primary tumor. However, ER expression in breast cancer primary lesion may not match with its synchronous metastatic lesions in some cases. In this study, we analyzed ER expression concordance between breast cancer primary tumor and metastatic lesions. Methods: Paraffin blocks of 100 primary breast invasive ductal carcinoma cases with axillary lymph node metastases were collected. Five tissue cores were punched out from individual primary breast cancer, and one tissue core from each lymph node metastases to assemble tissue microarrays for ER staining. Samples were then scored as 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ according to the number and intensity of ER stained tumor cells. Results: For cases with ER 3+ (strong expression) in all cores of primary lesions (n = 38), ER expression in metastatic lymph node was found in 94.7% of the patients. 91.0% of the metastatic lymph nodes were ER positive, and 84.3% of them to be 3+. Among the 46 cases of ER negative expression in all cores of primary lesions, 39 of them had all the metastatic nodes being ER negative, and ER negative nodes were seen in 95.7% of the metastases. As for 16 cases of ER inconsistent expression in primary lesions, 4 cases showed negative ER expression in all metastatic nodes, 2 cases displayed diffuse consistent ER 3+ expression, and 10 cases displayed variant ER expression. Conclusions: The findings suggest that ER expression concordance between breast cancer primary lesion and its matched metastatic lesions could be estimated by primary tumor ER expression pattern. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: There is a clear need for assays that can predict the risk of metastatic prostate cancer following curative procedures. Importantly these assays must be analytically robust in order to provide quality data for important clinical decisions. DNA microarray based gene expression assays measure several analytes simultaneously and can present specific challenges to analytical validation. This study describes the analytical validation of one such assay designed to predict metastatic recurrence in prostate cancer using primary formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumour material. Methods: Accuracy was evaluated with a method comparison study between the assay development platform (Prostate Disease Specific Array) and an alternative platform (Xcel™ microarray) using 50 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate cancer patient samples. An additional 70 samples were used to establish the assay reportable range. Determination of assay precision and sensitivity was performed on multiple technical replicates of three prostate cancer samples across multiple variables (operators, days, runs, reagent lots, and equipment) and RNA/cDNA inputs respectively using the appropriate linear mixed model. Results: The overall agreement between the development and alternative platform was 94.7% (95% confidence interval, 86.9-98.5%). The reportable range was determined to be 0.150 to 1.107 for core needle biopsy samples and - 0.214 to 0.844 for radical prostatectomy samples. From the precision study, the standard deviations for assay repeatability and reproducibility were 0.032 and 0.040 respectively. The sensitivity study demonstrated that a total RNA input and cDNA input of 50 ng and 3.5 μg respectively was conservative. Conclusion: The Metastatic Assay was found to be highly reproducible and precise. In conclusion the studies demonstrated an acceptable analytical performance for the assay and support its potential use in the clinic. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely related to gut microbiome. Here, the impact of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of the most prevalent products in the gut microbiome, on CRC immunotherapy is investigated. It is found that LPS is abundant in orthotopic CRC tissue and is associated with low responses to anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy, and clearance of Gram-negative bacteria from the gut using polymyxin B (PmB) or blockade of Toll-like receptor 4 using TAK-242 will both relieve the immunosuppressive microenvironment and boost T-cell infiltration into the CRC tumor. Further, an engineered LPS-targeting fusion protein is designed and its coding sequence is loaded into a lipid–protamine–DNA (LPD) nanoparticle system for selective expression of LPS trap protein and blocking LPS inside the tumor, and this nanotrapping system significantly relieves the immunosuppressive microenvironment and boosts anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy against CRC tumors. This LPS trap system even attenuates CRC liver metastasis when applied, suggesting the importance of blocking LPS in the gut–liver axis. The strategy applied here may provide a useful new way for treating CRC as well as other epithelial cancers that interact with mucosa microbiome. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

    "Abstract": "The elevation of oxidative stress preferentially in cancer cells by efficient NQO1 substrates, which promote ROS generation through redox cycling, has emerged as an effective strategy for cancer therapy, even for treating drug-resistant cancers. Here, we described the identification and structural optimization studies of the hit compound 1, a new chemotype of nonquinone substrate for NQO1 as an efficient ROS generator. Further structure-activity relationship studies resulted in the most active compound 20k, a tricyclic 2,3-dicyano indenopyrazinone, which selectively inhibited the proliferation of NQO1-overexpressing A549 and A549/Taxol cancer cells. Furthermore, 20k dramatically elevated the intracellular ROS levels through NQO1-catalyzed redox cycling and induced PARP-1-mediated cell apoptosis in A549/Taxol cells. In addition, 20k significantly suppressed the growth of A549/Taxol xenograft tumors in mice with no apparent toxicity observed in vivo.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Personalized peptide vaccine therapy is regarded as a well-tolerated, safe and effective immunotherapy for patients with advanced cancers. Herein we report an exceptional case of a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer who developed delayed lobular panniculitis at sites corresponding to vaccine injections. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old Japanese female visited our clinic due to thirst and polydipsia; she was diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes. Simultaneously, she was diagnosed as having advanced pancreatic cancer; and a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Afterwards, she received adjuvant chemotherapy with titanium silicate-1 and personalized peptide vaccination using Montanide® ISA-51 by a subcutaneous injection to her abdomen over a total of 30 times. Thirteen months after the vaccine therapy had come to an end, lobular panniculitis appeared at the vaccination sites. At this point, corticosteroid was administered, resulting in significant improvement in the condition of the subcutaneous nodules. CONCLUSIONS This case report highlights the importance of careful patient explanation before initiation of cancer vaccine therapy about the possibilities of lobular panniculitis as an adverse event. It also highlights that it is important that physicians have a greater awareness of the possibility of panniculitis in patients with concerns regarding subcutaneous indurations even long after the end of peptide vaccine therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Olaratumab is a platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα)-targeting monoclonal antibody blocking PDGFRα signaling. PDGFRα expression is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor ovarian cancer outcomes. This randomized, open label phase II study evaluated olaratumab plus liposomal doxorubicin compared with liposomal doxorubicin alone in advanced ovarian cancer patients. Methods: Patients with platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant advanced ovarian cancer were randomized 1:1 to receive liposomal doxorubicin (40 mg/m2, intravenous infusion) administered every 4 weeks with or without olaratumab (20 mg/kg, IV infusion) every 2 weeks. Patients were stratified based on prior response to platinum therapy (refractory vs resistant). The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, duration of response, and safety. Results: A total of 123 patients were treated (62 olaratumab+liposomal doxorubicin; 61 liposomal doxorubicin). Median PFS was 4.2 months for olaratumab+liposomal doxorubicin and 4.0 months for liposomal doxorubicin (stratified hazard ratio [HR] = 1.043; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.698-1.558; p = 0.837). Median OS was 16.6 months and 16.2 months in the olaratumab+liposomal doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin arms, respectively (HR = 1.098; 95% CI 0.71-1.71). In the platinum-refractory subgroup, median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI 1.6-9.2) and 3.7 months (95% CI 1.9-9.2) in the olaratumab+liposomal doxorubicin (n = 15) and liposomal doxorubicin arms (n = 16), respectively (HR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.38-1.91). Overall, 59.7% (olaratumab+liposomal doxorubicin) and 65.6% (liposomal doxorubicin) of patients reported grade ≥ 3 adverse events regardless of causality. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (all grades) regardless of causality were fatigue related (61%), nausea (57%), and constipation (52%) with olaratumab+liposomal doxorubicin and nausea (64%), fatigue related (62%), and mucositis (46%) with liposomal doxorubicin. Conclusions: The addition of olaratumab to liposomal doxorubicin did not result in significant prolongation of PFS or OS in platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer.

    "Abstract": "Replicative senescence, which is caused by telomere shortening from the end replication problem, is considered one of the tumor-suppressor mechanisms in eukaryotes. However, most cancers escape this replicative senescence by reactivating telomerase, an enzyme that extends the 3′-ends of the telomeres. Previously, we reported the telomerase inhibitory effect of a crude Zingiber officinale extract (ZOE), which suppressed hTERT expression, leading to a reduction in hTERT protein and telomerase activity in A549 lung cancer cells. In the present study, we found that ZOE-induced telomere shortening and cellular senescence during the period of 60 days when these A549 cells were treated with subcytotoxic doses of ZOE. Using assay-guided fractionation and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, we found that the major compounds in the active subfractions were paradols and shogaols of various chain lengths. The results from studies of pure 6-paradol and 6-shogaol confirmed that these two compounds could suppress hTERT expression as well as telomerase activity in A549 cells. These results suggest that these paradols and shogaols are likely the active compounds in ZOE that suppress hTERT expression and telomerase activity in these cells. Furthermore, ZOE was found to be nontoxic and had an anticlastogenic effect against diethylnitrosamine-induced liver micronucleus formation in rats. These findings suggest that ginger extract can potentially be useful in dietary cancer prevention. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel class of noncoding RNAs with functions in various pathophysiological activities. However, the expression profiles and functions of circRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unknown. Methods: High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to assess circRNA expression profiles in 4 paired CRC tissues, and significantly dysregulated circRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to predict the potential functions of dysregulated circRNAs. Target miRNAs of circRNAs were predicted using miRanda software, and were further analyzed combining DIANA-miRPath v.3 platform (Reverse Search module) with KEGG pathways of COLORECTAL CANCER and MicroRNAs in cancer (Entry: map05210 and map05206). CircRNA-miRNA interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape software. Expression levels of a significantly down-regulated circRNA, circDDX17 (hsa-circ-0002211), was detected by qRT-PCR in 60 paired CRC tissues. CircDDX17 was knockdown by siRNA, and the biological functions of circDDX17 were examined in CRC cell lines. Results: Totally 448 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified, including 394 up-regulated and 54 down-regulated circRNAs. qRT-PCR validation confirmed the reliability of the RNA-Seq data. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these dysregulated circRNAs were potentially implicated in CRC pathogenesis. Analyses by combining miRanda and miRPath softwares with KEGG pathways suggested that the miRNAs targeted by the top 10 dysregulated circRNAs were associated with the KEGG pathways of COLORECTAL CANCER and MicroRNAs in cancer, indicating that circRNA-miRNA interactions might play important functional roles in the initiation and progression of CRC. The results of qRT-PCR for circDDX17 in 60 paired CRC tissues showed that circDDX17 was significantly down-regulated in CRC tissues and associated with unfavorable clinicopathological parameters. In vitro experiments showed that silencing of circDDX17 promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibited apoptosis. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have identified numerous circRNAs that are dysregulated in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal mucosa tissues. Bioinformatic analyses suggested that these dysregulated circRNAs might play important functional roles in CRC tumorigenesis. CircDDX17 functions as a tumor suppressor and could serve as a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for CRC. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Reported immunoadjuvants still have many limitations, such as inferior cellular uptake capacity and biocompatibility, overly large particle sizes, single function, and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, large-pore mesoporous-silica-coated upconversion nanoparticles (UCMSs) with a size of less than 100 nm are successfully prepared by a typical silica sol–gel reaction using mesitylene as a pore-swelling agent and are applied as a novel immunoadjuvant. The obtained UCMSs not only show significantly higher loadings for the photosensitizers merocyanine 540 (MC540), model proteins (chicken ovalbumin (OVA)), and tumor antigens (tumor cell fragment (TF)), but also are successfully employed for highly efficient in vivo vaccine delivery. The prepared UCMSs–MC540–OVA under 980 nm near-infrared irradiation shows the best synergistic immunopotentiation action, verified by the strongest Th1 and Th2 immune responses and the highest frequency of CD4 + , CD8 + , and effector-memory T cells. Additionally, nanovaccines UCMSs–MC540–TF can more effectively inhibit tumor growth and increase the survival of colon cancer (CT26)-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice compared with either photodynamic therapy or immunological therapy alone, suggesting the enhanced immunotherapy efficacy and clinical potential of UCMSs as immunoadjuvants for cancer immunotherapy. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global challenge due to its high morbidity and mortality rates as well as poor response to treatment. The communication between tumor-derived elements and stroma plays a critical role in facilitating cancer progression of HCC. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are released from the cells upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. There is emerging evidence indicating that exosomes play a central role in cell-to-cell communication. Much attention has been paid to exosomes since they are found to transport bioactive proteins, messenger RNA (mRNAs) and microRNA (miRNAs) that can be transferred in active form to adjacent cells or to distant organs. However, the mechanisms underlying such cancer progression remain largely unexplored. Methods: Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation from conditioned medium of HCC cells and identified by electron microscopy and Western blotting analysis. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were treated with different concentrations of exosomes, and the activation of HSCs was analyzed by Western blotting analysis, wound healing, migration assay, Edu assay, CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Moreover, the different miRNA levels of exosomes were tested by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). The angiogenic ability of activated HSCs was analyzed by qRT-PCR, CCK-8 assay and tube formation assay. In addition, the abnormal lipid metabolism of activated HSCs was analyzed by Western blotting analysis and Oil Red staining. Finally, the relationship between serum exosomal miRNA-21 and prognosis of HCC patients was evaluated. Results: We showed that HCC cells exhibited a great capacity to convert normal HSCs to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Moreover, our data revealed that HCC cells secreted exosomal miRNA-21 that directly targeted PTEN, leading to activation of PDK1/AKT signaling in HSCs. Activated CAFs further promoted cancer progression by secreting angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF, MMP2, MMP9, bFGF and TGF-β. Clinical data indicated that high level of serum exosomal miRNA-21 was correlated with greater activation of CAFs and higher vessel density in HCC patients. Conclusions: Intercellular crosstalk between tumor cells and HSCs was mediated by tumor-derived exosomes that controlled progression of HCC. Our findings provided potential targets for prevention and treatment of live cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "3 years after standard treatment with surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. The benefit of the oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib in relapsed disease has been well established, but the benefit of olaparib as maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed disease is uncertain. METHODS We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III or IV) high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian-Tube cancer (or a combination thereof) with a mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, or both (BRCA1/2) who had a complete or partial clinical response after platinumbased chemotherapy. The patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS Of the 391 patients who underwent randomization, 260 were assigned to receive olaparib and 131 to receive placebo. A total of 388 patients had a centrally confirmed germline BRCA1/2 mutation, and 2 patients had a centrally confirmed somatic BRCA1/2 mutation. After a median follow-up of 41 months, the risk of disease progression or death was 70% lower with olaparib than with placebo (Kaplan-Meier estimate of the rate of freedom from disease progression and from death at 3 years, 60% vs. 27%; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.41; P<0.001). Adverse events were consistent with the known toxic effects of olaparib. CONCLUSIONS The use of maintenance therapy with olaparib provided a substantial benefit with regard to progression-free survival among women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation, with a 70% lower risk of disease progression or death with olaparib than with placebo.

    "Abstract": "Background Biomarkers of cardiac damages, such as troponin T (TnT) and the amino-terminal fragment of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), may be useful as early predictors of cardiac dysfunction. The role of these biomarkers in patients receiving lapatinib and/or trastuzumab before anthracyclines is unknown. This study explores TnT and NT-proBNP as predictors of early cardiac toxicity in neoadjuvant breast cancer patients. Methods This sub-study of the NEOALTTO trial tested if changes in the levels of TnT and NT-proBNP occurred after 2 weeks of anti-HER2 therapy (lapatinib, trastuzumab or their combination) alone and/or after 18 weeks of anti-HER2 therapy plus weekly paclitaxel. Results 173 and 172 were tested at all three timepoints for NT-proBNP and TnT, respectively. The incidence of biomarker elevation was overall low at all timepoints for all the three treatment arms. A total of 13 CEs in 11 patients occurred. Biomarker elevations in patients with CEs were very rare; only one patient with subsequent CE had a NT-proBNP elevation at baseline and at week 2. Conclusion These results suggest that TnT and proBNP may not be useful as early predictors of cardiac toxicity in anthra-cycline-naïve patients receiving trastuzumab and/or lapatinib. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Physical fitness and psychosocial function is often reduced in children during or shortly after cancer treatment. This study evaluates the effect of a combined physical exercise and psychosocial intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, body composition, psychosocial function and health-related quality of life (HrQoL). In addition, intervention mediators, applicability and adherence were examined. Methods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial included 68 children with cancer [mean age 13.2 (SD: 3.1) years; 54% male] during treatment or within 12-months post-treatment. The 12-week intervention consisted of 24 individual physical exercise sessions supervised by a physiotherapist, and 6 psychosocial training sessions for children and 2 for parents. Physical fitness and psychosocial function were assessed at baseline, directly post-intervention and at 12 months' post-baseline. Generalized estimating equations were used to simultaneously assess intervention effects at short and long-term. Additionally, we evaluated within-group differences over time. Potential physical and psychosocial mediators in the intervention effect on HrQoL were examined using the product-of-coefficient test. Applicability and adherence were assessed by trainer-report. Results: This study was able to compare 26 children who received the study intervention, with 33 children who received usual care. No significant differences in the effects of the intervention were found on physical fitness and psychosocial function at short-term. At 12-months follow-up, significantly larger improvements in lower body muscle strength (β = 56.5 Newton; 95% CI: 8.5; 104.5) were found in the intervention group when compared to the control group. Within-group changes showed significant improvements over time in HrQoL and bone density in both groups. Intervention effects on HrQoL were not significantly mediated by physical fitness and psychological function. Intervention applicability was satisfactory with an average session attendance of 67% and 22% dropout (mainly due to disease recurrence). Conclusions: This 12-week physical exercise and psychosocial training intervention for children with cancer was applicable and showed satisfactory adherence. We found no significant between-group differences in effect, except for a significant improvement in lower body muscle strength at long-term in the intervention group compared to the control group. Yet, both the intervention and the control group showed improvements in bone mineral density and HrQoL over time. Trial registration: The trial was registered at the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR1531).

    "Abstract": "Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), largely remains a primary cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The molecular mechanisms in LUAD metastasis have not been completely uncovered. Methods: In this study, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs (DEMs) and lncRNAs (DELs) underlying metastasis of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Intersection mRNAs were used to perform gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and co-expression network analysis. In addition, survival analyses of intersection mRNAs were conducted. Finally, intersection mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs were subjected to construct miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA network. Results: A total of 1015 DEGs, 54 DEMs and 22 DELs were identified in LUAD metastasis and non-metastasis samples. GO and KEGG pathway analysis had proven that the functions of intersection mRNAs were closely related with many important processes in cancer pathogenesis. Among the co-expression interactions network, 22 genes in the co-expression network were over the degree 20. These genes imply that they have connections with many other gene nodes. In addition, 14 target genes (ARHGAP11A, ASPM, HELLS, PRC1, TMPO, ARHGAP30, CD52, IL16, IRF8, P2RY13, PRKCB, PTPRC, SASH3 and TRAF3IP3) were found to be associated with survival in patients with LUAD significantly (log-rank P < 0.05). Two lncRNAs (LOC96610 and ADAM6) acting as ceRNAs were identified based on the miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA network. Conclusions: Taken together, the results may provide a novel perspective to develop a multiple gene diagnostic tool for LUAD prognosis, which might also provide potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for LUAD. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: There are no published studies on the simultaneous effect of extent and location of positive surgical margins (PSMs) on biochemical recurrence (BCR) after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). The aim was to report the incidence, extent, and location of PSMs over the inclusion period as well as the rates of BCR and cancer-related mortality, and determine if BCR is associated with PSM extent and/or location. Methods: Retrospective review of 530 consecutive patients who underwent RALP between 2003 and 2012. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses and Cox regressions were performed to determine variables associated with BCR. Results: For the 530 operated patients, evaluated at a median of 92 months (IQR, 87-99), PSMs were observed in 156 (29%), of which 24% were focal. Out of 172 PSMs, 126 (73%) were focal and 46 (27%) were extensive. The KM survival using BCR as endpoint was 0.81 (CI, 0.78-0.85) at 5 years and was 0.67 (CI, 0.61-0.72) at 10 years; and using cancer-related mortality as endpoint was 0.99 (CI, 0.99-1.00) at 5 years and 0.95 (CI, 0.92-0.98) at 10 years. Multi-variable analysis revealed the strongest predictors of BCR to be Gleason score ≥ 8 (HR = 7.97; CI, 4.38-14.51) and 4 + 3 (HR = 3.88; CI, 2.12-7.07), lymph nodes invasion (HR = 3.42; CI, 1.70-6.91), pT stage 3b or 4 (HR = 3.07; CI, 1.93-4.90), and extensive apical PSMs (HR = 2.62; CI, 1.40-4.90) but not focal apical PSMs (HR = 0.86; CI, 0.49-1.50; p = 0.586). Conclusion: Extensive apical PSMs significantly increased the risk of BCR, independently from pT stage, Gleason score and lymph nodes invasion, while focal apical PSMs had no significant effect on BCR. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The modulation of immune checkpoint receptors has been one of the most successful, exciting, and explored approaches for cancer immunotherapy. Currently, several immune checkpoint modulators, mainly monoclonal antibodies, are showing remarkable results. However, the failure to show a response in most patients and the induction of severe immune-related adverse effects are the major drawbacks. Novel approaches concerning the development of immune modulatory small molecules have emerged as an alternative. Nevertheless, the lack of structural information about immune checkpoint receptors has hindered the rational design of those small-molecule modulators by preventing the use of methodologies such as computer-aided drug design. Herein, we provide an overview and critical analysis of the structural and dynamic details of immune checkpoint receptors (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR)) and their interaction with known modulators. This knowledge is essential to advance the understanding of their binding mode and guide the design of novel effective targeted anticancer medicines. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Intramucosal, histologically mixed-type, low-grade (LG), well-differentiated gastric tubular adenocarcinomas (tub1s; LG-tub1s) have larger mean diameters and exhibit a higher frequency of the gastric mucin phenotype (G-phenotype) than pure LG-tub1s. In proportion to their increases in diameter, G-phenotype differentiated-type early gastric cancer (EGC) tumours reportedly grow to eventually contain (an) undifferentiated-type component(s) and LG-tub1s, which are included in differentiated-type EGCs, reportedly exhibit changes in their glandular architectural and cytological atypia grades from LG to high-grade (HG) and can grow to contain a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (tub2) component and undifferentiated components. Because they generally show a higher frequency of malignancy relative to tumours with a higher atypia grade and lower differentiation degree, it is suggested that, among mixed-type LG-tub1s, G-phenotype LG-tub1s containing an HG-tub2 component (LG-tub1s > HG-tub2) with undifferentiated components might lead to late-onset metastasis to lymph nodes even after a successful endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). We aimed to clarify the endoscopic and clinicopathological features of these G-phenotype LG-tub1s > HG-tub2. Methods: Of the 13,217 oesophagogastroduodenoscopies performed at our institutions between September 2008 and March 2016, 185 EGC lesions were evaluated in this retrospective observational study. Among these EGC lesions, 60 intramucosal LG-tub1s were divided into 53 tub1 (44 pure LG-tub1s and nine LG-tub1s containing HG-tub1) lesions and seven LG-tub1 > tub2 (LG-tub1 containing LG- and HG-tub2) lesions. Results: The frequencies of the superficial depressed type (P = 0.026), reddish colour (P = 0.006), HG of contained tub2s (P = 0.006), and G-phenotype (P = 0.028) were significantly higher in the LG-tub1 > tub2 group than those in the tub1 group. However, the largest lesion of the LG-tub1 > tub2 group had a superficial flat appearance, an isochromatic colour, an HG-tub2 and an undifferentiated component, and a large diameter greater than 30 mm, and it exhibited a G-phenotype. Conclusions: Intramucosal G-phenotype LG-tub1s > HG-tub2 are potential premalignant stomach neoplasms that may have specific endoscopic and clinicopathological features. However, G-phenotype LG-tub1s > HG-tub2 with undifferentiated component, which potentially show higher malignancy than those without undifferentiated components might change from a reddish to isochromatic colour. Accurately diagnosing, treating, and following-up G-phenotype LG-tub1s > HG-tub2 might decrease the number of patients who experience late-onset metastasis after ESD. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The targeting ability, drug-loading capacity, and size of the drug nanocarriers are crucial for enhancing the therapeutic index for cancer therapy. Herein, the morphology and size-controllable fabrication of supramolecular tumor-targeting nanocarriers based on host–guest recognition between a novel pillar[5]arene-based prodrug WP5-DOX and a Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-modified sulfonate guest RGD-SG is reported. The amphiphilic WP5-DOX⊃RGD-SG complex with a molar ratio of 5:1 self-assembles into vesicles, whereas smaller-sized micelles can be obtained by changing the molar ratio to 1:3. This represents a novel strategy of controllable construction of supramolecular nanovehicles with different sizes and morphologies based on the same host−guest interactions by using different host−guest ratios. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies reveal that both these prodrug nanocarriers could selectively deliver doxorubicin to RGD receptor-overexpressing cancer cells, leading to longer blood retention time, enhanced antitumor efficacy, and reduced systematic toxicity in murine tumor model, suggesting their potential application for targeted drug delivery. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Development of a single combinatorial nanoplatform technology to target cancer cells has been an unprecedented reality in boosting synergistic antitumor activities and in reducing off-target effects. An antitumor delivery system is designed using a chemotherapy drug and a tumor target molecule covalently linked to cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria). Nanoceria have a unique redox activity in that they possess antioxidant activity at physiological pH but have an intrinsic oxidase activity at acidic pH. The system is integrated with 1) extracellular pH responsive functionality, 2) tumor cell targetable (CXC chemokine receptor 4, CXCR4 receptor specific) antagonist, 3) reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducible nanoceria, and 4) chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX). These combinatorial nanoparticles (AMD–GCCNPs–DOX) are not only sensitive to the extracellular acidic pH conditions and targeted tumor cells but can also instantaneously induce ROS and release DOX intracellularly to enhance the chemotherapeutic activity in retinoblastoma cells (WERI-Rb-1 and Y79) and in xenograft (Y79/GFP-luc grafted) and genetic p107s (RbLox/lox, p107+/−, p130−/−) orthotopic mice models. A lucidly engineered combinatorial nanoconstruct is introduced that offers a viable and simple strategy for delivering a cocktail of therapeutics into tumor cells under acidosis, exhibiting a promising new future for clinical therapeutic opportunities. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of blood cancers that arise following the sequential acquisition of genetic lesions in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We identify mutational cooperation between Jak2V617F expression and Dnmt3a loss that drives progression from early-stage polycythemia vera to advanced myelofibrosis. Using in vivo, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) disruption of Dnmt3a in Jak2V617F knockin HSPC, we show that Dnmt3a loss blocks the accumulation of erythroid elements and causes fibrotic infiltration within the bone marrow and spleen. Transcriptional analysis and integration with human data sets identified a core DNMT3A-driven gene-expression program shared across multiple models and contexts of Dnmt3a loss. Aberrant self-renewal and inflammatory signaling were seen in Dnmt3a2/2 Jak2V617F HSPC, driven by increased chromatin accessibility at enhancer elements. These findings identify oncogenic cooperativity between Jak2V617F-driven MPN and Dnmt3a loss, leading to activation of HSPC enhancer–driven inflammatory signaling. © 2018 by The American Society of Hematology; all rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have provided a significant improvement in the disease outcome of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, some marketed drugs affect a transient beneficial response in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. We reported a series of potential EGFR inhibitors through incorporation of macrocyclic polyamine into 4-anilinoquinazoline scaffold. It is expected that anilinoquinazoline part effectively bind to EGFR domain, while ATP molecules are captured by a macrocyclic polyamine moiety. In vitro experiments exhibited that most of tested compounds suppressed tumor cell proliferation more strongly than Gefitinib and Lapatinib (dual inhibitor of EGFR/HER2) as controls. In kinase assays, the compound 1f showed excellent dual inhibition activity toward EGFR WT (IC 50 = 1.4 nM) and HER2 (IC 50 = 2.1 nM). In vivo pharmacology evaluation of 1f showed significant antitumor activity (TGI = 44.2%) in A549 xenografts mice. The current work provided a feasible solution to optimize anilinoquinazoline-based inhibitors. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Itraconazole has been found to possess potent antiangiogenic activity, exhibiting promising antitumor activity in several human clinical studies. The wider use of itraconazole in the treatment of cancer, however, has been limited by its potent inhibition of the drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). In an effort to eliminate the CYP3A4 inhibition while retaining its antiangiogenic activity, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives in which the 1,2,4-triazole ring is replaced with various azoles and nonazoles. Among these analogues, 15n with tetrazole in place of 1,2,4-triazole exhibited optimal inhibition of human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation with an IC 50 of 73 nM without a significant effect on CYP3A4 (EC 50 &gt; 20 μM). Similar to itraconazole, 15n induced Niemann-Pick C phenotype (NPC phenotype) and blocked AMPK/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling. These results suggest that 15n is a promising angiogenesis inhibitor that can be used in combination with most other known anticancer drugs. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Efficient organic photosensitizers are attractive for cancer cell ablation in photodynamic therapy. Bright fluorescent photosensitizers are highly desirable for simultaneous imaging and therapy. However, due to fundamental competition between emission and singlet oxygen generation, design attempts to increase singlet oxygen generation almost always leads to the loss of fluorescence. Herein, it is shown for the first time that nanocrystallization enables a simultaneous and significant increase in the brightness and singlet oxygen generation of an organic photosensitizer. Spectroscopic studies show simultaneous enhancement in the visible light absorption and fluorescence after nanocrystallization. The enhanced absorption of visible light in nanocrystals is found to translate directly to the enhanced singlet oxygen production, which shows a higher ability to kill HeLa cells as compared to their amorphous counterpart. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: Oncogenic Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are closely associated with anal cancer which is high among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected males. There are no data regarding anal HPV infection and cytological abnormalities in HIV positive males receiving free therapy in the national program. Thus, this cross-sectional study was performed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of anal HPV infection and cytological abnormalities in HIV positive males. Methods: We screened 126 HIV-positive male patients attending the antiretroviral treatment center (ART) between 2014 and 2015 with anal papanicolaou smear cytology and HPV-DNA testing. HPV-DNA was detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with two consensus primer sets E6 and MY09/11 and further analyzed for the presence of various HPV genotype by Sanger sequencing. Risk factors associated with anal cytological abnormalities and HPV infection was analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Out of 126, 52 were on antiretroviral therapy. 91% were married to female partners but during the study 48 (38%) gave positive history of anal intercourse with other men. Anal cytology was done in 95 patients, out of which 60 (63.15%) had cytological abnormalities. LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) was present in 27 (45%), ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) in 31 (52%) and ASC-H (atypical squamous cells cannot exclude a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) in 2 (3.33%). In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for cytological abnormality were presence of history of anal intercourse (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 2.0-18.7) and WHO stage III & IV (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-7.5). HPV-DNA was detected in 33/119 (27.73%) patients. The most prevalent HPV type in the study was HPV-16 (10.08%), other HPV types detected were 18,31,35,17,66,72,52,68 and 107 (17.65%). Conclusions: High prevalence of anal cytological abnormalities in our study suggests that regular anal Pap smear screening should be done in HIV positive males in the ART center. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "[99mTc][TcN-DBODC(5) is the lead candidate of a class of cationic complexes proposed as myocardial imaging agents (MPIAs). Phase I clinical studies showed that its clinical properties were comparable to those of the commercially available agents. Thus, modification of [99mTc]TcN-DBODC(5), directed to obtain an ideal myocardial imaging without interference from the adjacent organ activities, is desirable. This work describes the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic development of four new complexes of general formula [99mTc][Tc(N)(DASD)(PNPn)]+, [99mTc]TcN-DASD(n) (DASD = 1,4-dioxa-8-azaspiro[4,5]decandithiocarbamate; PNPn = bisphosphinoamine), proposed as improved MPIAs. Among the tested compounds, [99mTc]TcN-DASD(5) and [99mTc]TcN-DASD(7) showed enhanced heart uptake compared with the gold standards, with a rapid liver washout and superior heart-to-liver ratio. These features might shorten the duration of imaging procedures below 30 min, consenting the early acquisition of high-quality images. In addition, mechanistic studies were performed in cellulo by using human drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cell lines, obtaining results which might be conveniently applied to tumor imaging. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",

Methods: In this study, the anti-proliferative activities of these agents were evaluated in colorectal carcinoma cell lines with three phenotypes exposed to several batches of triphala samples with different quantities of chebulinic acid and chebulagic acid. The pro-apoptotic and anti-migratory activities and the probable antitumour mechanisms of the more potent anti-proliferative phytochemical were also investigated. Results: The results demonstrated that chebulinic acid, which exerts potent anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and anti-migratory effects, is a key molecule for maintaining the antitumour efficacy of triphala. The antitumour mechanism of chebulinic acid is probably related to the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways. Conclusions: Chebulinic acid is not only a critical component of the anticancer activities of triphala but also a promising natural multi-target antitumour agent with therapeutic potential. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Proteins and ligands sample a conformational ensemble that governs molecular recognition, activity, and dissociation. In structure-based drug design, access to this conformational ensemble is critical to understand the balance between entropy and enthalpy in lead optimization. However, ligand conformational heterogeneity is currently severely underreported in crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank, owing in part to a lack of automated and unbiased procedures to model an ensemble of protein-ligand states into X-ray data. Here, we designed a computational method, qFit-ligand, to automatically resolve conformationally averaged ligand heterogeneity in crystal structures, and applied it to a large set of protein receptor-ligand complexes. In an analysis of the cancer related BRD4 domain, we found that up to 29% of protein crystal structures bound with drug-like molecules present evidence of unmodeled, averaged, relatively isoenergetic conformations in ligand-receptor interactions. In many retrospective cases, these alternate conformations were adventitiously exploited to guide compound design, resulting in improved potency or selectivity. Combining qFit-ligand with high-throughput screening or multitemperature crystallography could therefore augment the structure-based drug design toolbox. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4), a serine endoprotease of the proprotein convertases family, has been recognized as a promising target for prostate cancer. We previously reported a selective and potent peptide-based inhibitor for PACE4, named the multi-Leu peptide (Ac-LLLLRVKR-NH 2 sequence), which was then modified into a more potent and stable compound named C23 with the following structure: Ac-dLeu-LLLRVK-Amba (Amba: 4-amidinobenzylamide). Despite improvements in both in vitro and in vivo profiles of C23, its selectivity for PACE4 over furin was significantly reduced. We examined other Arg-mimetics instead of Amba to regain the lost selectivity. Our results indicated that the replacement of Amba with 5-(aminomethyl)picolinimidamide increased affinity for PACE4 and restored selectivity. Our results also provide a better insight on how structural differences between S1 pockets of PACE4 and furin could be employed in the rational design of selective inhibitors. © Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Gold nanorods (AuNRs), with their unique physicochemical properties, are recognized as promising materials for biomedical applications. Chemical modification of their surfaces is attracting increasing attention with regard to cytotoxicity and cellular uptake. Herein, the toxicological effects of three types of polymer-coated AuNRs, which are cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-coated AuNRs, polystyrene sulphonate-coated AuNRs, and poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride-coated AuNRs (PDDAC-AuNRs), on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are investigated. The results show significantly different effects on VSMCs with different surface coatings. PDDAC-AuNRs, which were nontoxic in cancer cells in previous reports, display extreme toxicity to VSMCs. Initial contact between AuNRs and cell membranes is the important step in AuNRs cellular uptake. Force spectroscopy based on atomic force microscopy is exploited to study interactions between AuNRs and VSMCs membrane in the absence or presence of a corona on the AuNRs surface. The results show that the binding force and binding probability between AuNRs and membranes are closely related to cytotoxicity and cellular responses. These findings highlight the importance of assessing nanoparticle cytotoxicity in somatic cells for medical applications. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

    "Abstract": "Currently available 3D assemblies based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) lag far behind their 2D CNT-based bricks and require major improvements for biological applications. By using Fe nanoparticles confined to the interlamination of graphite as catalyst, a fully 3D interconnected CNT web is obtained through the pores of graphene foam (GCNT web) by in situ chemical vapor deposition. This 3D GCNT web has a thickness up to 1.5 mm and a completely geometric, mechanical and electrical interconnectivity. Dissociated cortical cells cultured inside the GCNT web form a functional 3D cortex-like network exhibiting a spontaneous electrical activity that is closer to what is observed in vivo. By coculturing and fluorescently labeling glioma and healthy cortical cells with different colors, a new in vitro model is obtained to investigate malignant glioma infiltration. This model allows the 3D trajectories and velocity distribution of individual infiltrating glioma to be reconstructed with an unprecedented precision. The model is cost effective and allows a quantitative and rigorous screening of anticancer drugs. The fully 3D interconnected GCNT web is biocompatible and is an ideal tool to study 3D biological processes in vitro representing a pivotal step toward precise and personalized medicine. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Development of a sophisticated nanotherapeutic platform to deliver potent agents effectively and safely to desired tumor sites remains challenging. Cabazitaxel (CTX) holds particular interest for clinical use because of its ability to overcome the drug resistance caused by other taxane drugs. However, investigations of this potent agent have been met with only limited success due to its high toxicity in patients, and thus the exploration of CTX as a safe chemotherapeutic remains a tremendous challenge. Here, it is reported that CTX can be structurally tailored to make it more compatible with a polymeric platform through chemical derivatization with oligolactide (oLA). Covalent conjugation of CTX to oLAs yields new entities that are sufficiently miscible with exogenous polymer matrices to form injectable nanomedicines (termed o(LA)n-CTX-NPs). Utilizing these o(LA)n-CTX-NPs, the remarkable increases in tumor accumulation and amelioration of drug toxicity in animals are demonstrated. In a xenograft model of lung cancer, administration of o(LA)18-CTX-NPs enhances the antitumor efficacy relative to administration of free CTX. Overall, the data show that precision editing of drug chemical structures can be harnessed to generate better tolerated and more efficient nanomedicines. This approach might be a complementary strategy to simultaneously augment the safety and potency of other anticancer agents. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

    "Abstract": "Fabrication of reproducible and versatile surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates is crucial for real-time applications such as explosive detection for human safety and biological imaging for cancer diagnosis. However, it still remains a challenging task, even after several methodologies were developed by various research groups, primarily due to (a) a lack of consistency in detection of a variety of molecules (b) cost-effectiveness of the SERS substrates prepared, and (c) byzantine preparation procedures, etc. Herein, we establish a procedure for preparing reproducible SERS-active substrates comprised of laser-induced nanoparticle-embedded periodic surface structures (LINEPSS) and metallization of silicon (Si) LINEPSS. LINEPSS were fabricated using the technique of femtosecond laser ablation of Si in acetone. The versatile SERS-active substrates were then achieved by two ways, including the drop casting of silver (Ag)/gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) on Si LINEPSS and Ag plating on the Si LINEPSS structures. By controlling the LINEPSS grating periodicity, the effect of plasmonic nanoparticles/plasmonic plating on the Si NPs embedded periodic surface structures enormously improved the SPR strength, resulting in the consistent and superior Raman enhancements. The reproducible SERS signals were achieved by detecting the molecules of Methylene Blue (MB), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and 5-amino-3-nitro-l,2,4-triazole (ANTA). The SERS signal strength is determined by the grating periodicity, which, in turn, is determined by the input laser fluence. The SERS-active platform with grating periodicity of 130 ± 10 nm and 150 ± 5 nm exhibited strong Raman enhancements of ∼108 for MB and ∼107 for ANTA molecules, respectively, and these platforms are demonstrated to be capable, even for multiple usages. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: A-to-I RNA editing is a co-/post-transcriptional modification catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, that deaminates Adenosines (A) into Inosines (I). Most of known editing events are located within inverted ALU repeats, but they also occur in coding sequences and may alter the function of encoded proteins. RNA editing contributes to generate transcriptomic diversity and it is found altered in cancer, autoimmune and neurological disorders. Emerging evidences indicate that editing process could be influenced by genetic variations, biological and environmental variables. Results: We analyzed RNA editing levels in human blood using RNA-seq data from 459 healthy individuals and identified 2079 sites consistently edited in this tissue. As expected, analysis of gene expression revealed that ADAR is the major contributor to editing on these sites, explaining ~ 13% of observed variability. After removing ADAR effect, we found significant associations for 1122 genes, mainly involved in RNA processing. These genes were significantly enriched in genes encoding proteins interacting with ADARs, including 276 potential ADARs interactors and 9 ADARs direct partners. In addition, our analysis revealed several factors potentially influencing RNA editing in blood, including cell composition, age, Body Mass Index, smoke and alcohol consumption. Finally, we identified genetic loci associated with editing levels, including known ADAR eQTLs and a small region on chromosome 7, containing LOC730338, a lincRNA gene that appears to modulate ADARs mRNA expression. Conclusions: Our data provides a detailed picture of the most relevant RNA editing events and their variability in human blood, giving interesting insights on potential mechanisms behind this post-transcriptional modification and its regulation in this tissue. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: We report on a 21-year-old patient with a giant symptomatic hydatid cyst of the interventricular septum, to whom a staged management approach was employed. Induction medical therapy led to a reduction in the size of the cyst, which was then completely removed via surgical excision. Case presentation: A 21-year-old male Caucasian, with main complaints of fatigue and palpitations, was referred to our Centre due to a cystic formation in his left ventricle. The workup consisted of transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, which revealed a huge hydatid cyst in an active stage of disease, occupying the basal and mid part of the interventricular septum. Due to the size of the lesion and lack of viable myocardium in the affected area, the patient was declared inoperable and medical therapy was initiated. Serial echocardiography revealed a significant reduction in the size of the lesion and degradation to transitional and inactive stage, after which successful surgical excision of the cyst was performed. In the course of the medical treatment, the patient experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia causing loss of consciousness, which did not reoccur after surgical excision. Conclusion: Medical therapy can result in the degradation of a giant heart hydatid cyst, enabling surgical excision. Heart hydatid cyst can lead to potentially lethal arrhythmia irrespective of its size and stage, which does not reoccur after successful surgical excision. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In protein engineering, investigations of catalytic cycle facilitate rational design of enzymes. In the present work, deeper analysis on the catalytic cycle of malate enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), an enzyme involved in cancer metabolic and fatty acid synthesis, was performed. In substrate binding, stereoselective recognition of a substrate originates from distance and angle difference between two chiral substrates and Mn 2+ as well as monodentate or coplanar ion reaction with Arg165. In catalytic transformation, the activation barrier for the hydride transfer of d-malate is 20.28 kcal/mol higher than that for l-malate. The activation barrier for β-decarboxylation of oxaloacetate is about 4.59 kcal/mol higher than the activation barrier for the hydride transfer of l-malate. The effective activation barrier is 16.44 kcal/mol, which is in close agreement with the value derived from the application of transition-state theory and the Eyring equation to k cat . In ligand release, l/d-malate needs to overcome a higher barrier than pyruvate to break all bonds in parallel and then to escape from the binding pocket. Leu167 and Asn421 comprise a swinging gate to control the product release. The more open gate is possibly required in the direction of pyruvate to l-malate. Our studies are focused on extending structural knowledge regarding the malate enzyme and provided a powerful strategy for future experimental investigations. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Phototherapy as a promising cancer diagnostic and therapeutic strategy has aroused extensive attention. However, single-wavelength near-infrared (NIR) light–triggered combinational treatment of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is still a great challenge. Herein, a multifunctional micelle activated by a single-wavelength laser for simultaneous PTT and PDT as well as fluorescence imaging is developed. Briefly, new indocyanine green (IR820) is conjugated to d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) via the linker 6-aminocaproic acid, and then, chlorin e6 (Ce6) is encapsulated into the micelles formed by TPGS–IR820 conjugates to fabricate TPGS–IR820/Ce6 micelles. As the well-designed TPGS–IR820 conjugate shares a similar peak absorption wavelength with Ce6, this micelle can be applied with a single NIR laser (660 nm). The stable micelles exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency in vitro and in vivo as well as high singlet oxygen generation capacity in tumor cells. After efficient cellular internalization, the as-prepared micelles display outstanding anticancer activity upon single NIR laser irradiation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TPGS–IR820/Ce6 micelles show negligible systemic toxicity. The highly safe and effective TPGS–IR820/Ce6 micelles can offer an innovative strategy to construct single NIR light–induced PTT and PDT combined phototherapy nanoplatforms via suitable modification of organic phototherapeutic agents. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "mRNA-mediated protein replacement represents a promising concept for the treatment of liver disorders. Children born with fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) mutations suffer from Hepatorenal Tyrosinemia Type 1 (HT-1) resulting in renal dysfunction, liver failure, neurological impairments, and cancer. Protein replacement therapy using FAH mRNA offers tremendous potential to cure HT-1, but is currently hindered by the development of effective mRNA carriers that can function in diseased livers. Structure-guided, rational optimization of 5A2-SC8 mRNA-loaded dendrimer lipid nanoparticles (mDLNPs) increases delivery potency of FAH mRNA, resulting in functional FAH protein and sustained normalization of body weight and liver function in FAH −/− knockout mice. Optimization using luciferase mRNA produces DLNP carriers that are efficacious at mRNA doses as low as 0.05 mg kg −1 in vivo. mDLNPs transfect &gt; 44% of all hepatocytes in the liver, yield high FAH protein levels (0.5 mg kg −1 mRNA), and are well tolerated in a knockout mouse model with compromised liver function. Genetically engineered FAH −/− mice treated with FAH mRNA mDLNPs have statistically equivalent levels of TBIL, ALT, and AST compared to wild type C57BL/6 mice and maintain normal weight throughout the month-long course of treatment. This study provides a framework for the rational optimization of LNPs to improve delivery of mRNA broadly and introduces a specific and viable DLNP carrier with translational potential to treat genetic diseases of the liver. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: Angiogenesis is important in physiological and pathological conditions, as blood vessels provide nutrients and oxygen needed for tissue growth and survival. Therefore, targeting angiogenesis is a prominent strategy in both tissue engineering and cancer treatment. However, not all of the approaches to promote or inhibit angiogenesis lead to successful outcomes. Angiogenesis-based therapies primarily target pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in isolation. However, pre-clinical and clinical evidence shows these therapies often have limited effects. To improve therapeutic strategies, including targeting FGF and VEGF in combination, we need a quantitative understanding of the how the promoters combine to stimulate angiogenesis. Results: In this study, we trained and validated a detailed mathematical model to quantitatively characterize the crosstalk of FGF and VEGF intracellular signaling. This signaling is initiated by FGF binding to the FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) or VEGF binding to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) to promote downstream signaling. The model focuses on FGF- and VEGF-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), which promotes cell proliferation. We apply the model to predict the dynamics of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) in response to the stimulation by FGF and VEGF individually and in combination. The model predicts that FGF and VEGF have differential effects on pERK. Additionally, since VEGFR2 upregulation has been observed in pathological conditions, we apply the model to investigate the effects of VEGFR2 density and trafficking parameters. The model predictions show that these parameters significantly influence the response to VEGF stimulation. Conclusions: The model agrees with experimental data and is a framework to synthesize and quantitatively explain experimental studies. Ultimately, the model provides mechanistic insight into FGF and VEGF interactions needed to identify potential targets for pro- or anti-angiogenic therapies. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Ibrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) since 2016 but has not been compared with chemoimmunotherapy. We conducted a phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib, either alone or in combination with rituximab, relative to chemoimmunotherapy. METHODS Patients 65 years of age or older who had untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive bendamustine plus rituximab, ibrutinib, or ibrutinib plus rituximab. The primary end point was progression-free survival. The Alliance Data and Safety Monitoring Board made the decision to release the data after the protocol-specified efficacy threshold had been met. RESULTS A total of 183 patients were assigned to receive bendamustine plus rituximab, 182 to receive ibrutinib, and 182 to receive ibrutinib plus rituximab. Median progressionfree survival was reached only with bendamustine plus rituximab. The estimated percentage of patients with progression-free survival at 2 years was 74% with bendamustine plus rituximab and was higher with ibrutinib alone (87%; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.58; P<0.001) and with ibrutinib plus rituximab (88%; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.59; P>0.001). There was no significant difference between the ibrutinib-plusrituximab group and the ibrutinib group with regard to progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.62; P = 0.49). With a median follow-up of 38 months, there was no significant difference among the three treatment groups with regard to overall survival. The rate of grade 3, 4, or 5 hematologic adverse events was higher with bendamustine plus rituximab (61%) than with ibrutinib or ibrutinib plus rituximab (41% and 39%, respectively), whereas the rate of grade 3, 4, or 5 nonhematologic adverse events was lower with bendamustine plus rituximab (63%) than with the ibrutinib-containing regimens (74% with each regimen). CONCLUSIONS Among older patients with untreated CLL, treatment with ibrutinib was superior to treatment with bendamustine plus rituximab with regard to progression-free survival. There was no significant difference between ibrutinib and ibrutinib plus rituximab with regard to progression-free survival.

    "Abstract": "Background: Novel anti-schistosomal multi-stage drugs are needed because only a single drug, praziquantel, is available for the treatment of schistosomiasis and is poorly effective on larval and juvenile stages of the parasite. Schistosomes have a complex life-cycle and multiple developmental stages in the intermediate and definitive hosts. Acetylation and deacetylation of histones play pivotal roles in chromatin structure and in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors modulate acetylation of several other proteins localized both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and therefore impact on many signaling networks and biological processes. Histone post-translational modifications may provide parasites with the ability to readily adapt to changes in gene expression required for their development and adaptation to the host environment. The aim of the present study was to screen a HDAC class I inhibitor library in order to identify and characterize novel multi-stage hit compounds. Methods: We used a high-throughput assay based on the quantitation of ATP in the Schistosoma mansoni larval stage (schistosomula) and screened a library of 1500 class I HDAC inhibitors. Subsequently, a few hits were selected and further characterized by viability assays and phenotypic analyses on adult parasites by carmine red and confocal microscopy. Results: Three compounds (SmI-124, SmI-148 and SmI-558) that had an effect on the viability of both the schistosomula larval stage and the adult worm were identified. Treatment with sub-lethal doses of SmI-148 and SmI-558 also decreased egg production. Moreover, treatment of adult parasites with SmI-148, and to a lesser extent Sm-124, was associated with histone hyperacetylation. Finally, SmI-148 and SmI-558 treatments of worm pairs caused a phenotype characterized by defects in the parasite reproductive system, with peculiar features in the ovary. In addition, SmI-558 induced oocyte- and vitelline cell-engulfment and signs of degeneration in the uterus and/or oviduct. Conclusions: We report the screening of a small HDAC inhibitor library and the identification of three novel compounds which impair viability of the S. mansoni larval stage and adult pairs. These compounds are useful tools for studying deacetylase activity during parasite development and for interfering with egg production. Characterization of their specificity for selected S. mansoni versus human HDAC could provide insights that can be used in optimization and compound design. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tornillo et al. show that in aggressive breast cancers, LYN activity is deregulated by a change in patterns of splice isoform expression. In BRCA1-dysfunctional breast cancers, LYN activity is upregulated by a prolyl isomerase (PIN1) that is normally repressed by BRCA1. © 2018 The Author(s)The SRC-family kinase LYN is highly expressed in triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer (TNBC) and in the cell of origin of these tumors, c-KIT-positive luminal progenitors. Here, we demonstrate LYN is a downstream effector of c-KIT in normal mammary cells and protective of apoptosis upon genotoxic stress. LYN activity is modulated by PIN1, a prolyl isomerase, and in BRCA1 mutant TNBC PIN1 upregulation activates LYN independently of c-KIT. Furthermore, the full-length LYN splice isoform (as opposed to the Δaa25–45 variant) drives migration and invasion of aggressive TNBC cells, while the ratio of splice variants is informative for breast cancer-specific survival across all breast cancers. Thus, dual mechanisms—uncoupling from upstream signals and splice isoform ratios—drive the activity of LYN in aggressive breast cancers. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "A major challenge in cancer research is the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, which includes the host immunological setting. Inspired by the emerging technology of organ-on-chip, we achieved 3D co-cultures in microfluidic devices (integrating four cell populations: cancer, immune, endothelial, and fibroblasts) to reconstitute ex vivo a human tumor ecosystem (HER2 + breast cancer). We visualized and quantified the complex dynamics of this tumor-on-chip, in the absence or in the presence of the drug trastuzumab (Herceptin), a targeted antibody therapy directed against the HER2 receptor. We uncovered the capacity of the drug trastuzumab to specifically promote long cancer-immune interactions (&gt;50 min), recapitulating an anti-tumoral ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) immune response. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) antagonized the effects of trastuzumab. These observations constitute a proof of concept that tumors-on-chip are powerful platforms to study ex vivo immunocompetent tumor microenvironments, to characterize ecosystem-level drug responses, and to dissect the roles of stromal components. © 2018 The AuthorsInspired by the emerging technology of tumor-on-chip, Nguyen et al. reconstituted ex vivo a human tumor microenvironment (HER2 + breast cancer), characterized the ecosystem-level responses to the drug trastuzumab (Herceptin), and dissected the roles of stromal components (immune cells and fibroblasts), demonstrating the power of immunocompetent tumors-on-chip for preclinical drug studies. © 2018 The Authors",
