    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: The adrenal gland is a frequent site for metastasis, and a solitary adrenal mass is often observed during staging workup or imaging follow-up in patients with extra-adrenal malignancy. To create an appropriate management plan, it is essential to distinguish between benign adrenal lesions and metastasis in patients with extra-adrenal cancer having solitary adrenal masses. Therefore, here we evaluated the predictive factors for adrenal metastasis in patients with extra-adrenal malignancy having solitary adrenal mass. Materials and Methods: From September 2003 to June 2016, we retrospectively reviewed patients with extra-adrenal malignancy having solitary adrenal mass on a cancer staging workup or follow-up study who subsequently underwent adrenalectomy at our institution. All patients underwent preoperative functional studies; those with positive results were excluded from this study. Characteristics of oncology patients with adrenal mass including age, sex, body mass index, smoking, mass location, mass size, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, precontrast Hounsfield unit (HU), and synchronous or metachronous adrenal mass based on the time of the extra-adrenal cancer diagnosis were analyzed. Results: Of the total 68 patients with extra-adrenal cancer having solitary adrenal mass, 22 had pathologically confirmed adrenal metastasis. Primary cancers consisted of hepatocellular cell carcinoma (n = 7), renal cell carcinoma (n = 7), lung cancer (n = 4), colon cancer (n = 3), and breast cancer (n = 1). On multivariate analysis, a higher precontrast HU (P = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 1.105, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.042-1.172), male sex (P = 0.019, OR = 9.782, 95% CI = 1.462-65.461), and metachronous adrenal mass (P = 0.007, OR = 11.090, 95% CI = 1.937-63.490) were observed as predictive factors for adrenal metastasis in patients with extra-adrenal cancer having solitary adrenal mass. The cut-off value of precontrast HU to distinguish between metastasis and benign lesions was 36.2 (sensitivity = 81.8%; specificity = 91.3%). Conclusion: High precontrast HU (> 36), male sex, and metachronous adrenal mass are predictive factors for adrenal metastasis in patients with extra-adrenal malignancy having solitary adrenal mass. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "About 10–20% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are candidates for metastasis directed therapies such as surgical resection, ablation and stereotactic radiotherapy. We examined the temporal changes in use of metastasis directed therapies and established prognostic factors for survival in a nationwide cohort study. The Danish nationwide medical registries were used to retrieve data on treatment for liver and/or lung metastasis in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in the period 2000–2013. Overall survival through 2014 was calculated from the time of treatment of metastases by Kaplan–Meier method and mortality between groups was assessed using Cox regression. We report 2,912 patients undergoing a total of 3,602 procedures with an increased use of all modalities during 14 calendar years. Median survival was 3.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 2.0–9.7 years). In the multivariate analysis, the nodal stage of the primary tumor had the most pronounced association with survival with a hazard ratio for mortality of 1.56 (95% CI: 1.33–1.83) for N2 stage with reference to N0. Furthermore, female gender, age, comorbidity, surgical treatment, administration of chemotherapy, and left-sided primary tumors were associated with improved prognosis in the multivariate analysis. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Effective immunotherapy of stromal-rich tumors requires simultaneous targeting of cancer cells and immunosuppressive elements of the microenvironment. Here, we modified the oncolytic group B adenovirus enadenotucirev to express a stroma-targeted bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). This BiTE bound fibroblast activation protein on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and CD3e on T cells, leading to potent T-cell activation and fibroblast death. Treatment of fresh clinical biopsies, including malignant ascites and solid prostate cancer tissue, with FAP-BiTE–encoding virus induced activation of tumor-infiltrating PD1þ T cells to kill CAFs. In ascites, this led to depletion of CAF-associated immunosuppressive factors, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased gene expression of markers of antigen presentation, T-cell function, and trafficking. M2-like ascites macrophages exhibited a proinflammatory repolarization, indicating spectrum-wide alteration of the tumor microenvironment. With this approach, we have actively killed both cancer cells and tumor fibroblasts, reversing CAF-mediated immunosuppression and yielding a potent single-agent therapeutic that is ready for clinical assessment. Significance: An engineered oncolytic adenovirus that encodes a bispecific antibody combines direct virolysis with endogenous T-cell activation to attack stromal fibroblasts, providing a multimodal treatment strategy within a single therapeutic agent. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Although cancer stem cells (CSC) are thought to be responsible for tumor recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy, CSC-related research and drug development have been hampered by the limited supply of diverse, patient-derived CSC. Here, we present a functional polymer thin film (PTF) platform that promotes conversion of cancer cells to highly tumorigenic three-dimensional (3D) spheroids without the use of biochemical or genetic manipulations. Culturing various human cancer cells on the specific PTF, poly(2,4,6,8tetravinyl-2,4,6,8-tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane) (pV4D4), gave rise to numerous multicellular tumor spheroids within 24 hours with high efficiency and reproducibility. Cancer cells in the resulting spheroids showed a significant increase in the expression of CSC-associated genes and acquired increased drug resistance compared with two-dimensional monolayer-cultured controls. These spheroids also exhibited enhanced xenograft tumor-forming ability and metastatic capacity in nude mice. By enabling the generation of tumorigenic spheroids from diverse cancer cells, the surface platform described here harbors the potential to contribute to CSC-related basic research and drug development. Significance: A new cell culture technology enables highly tumorigenic 3D spheroids to be easily generated from various cancer cell sources in the common laboratory. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Primary staging of prostate cancer relies on modalities, which are limited. We evaluate simultaneous [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET (PSMA-PET)/MRI as a new diagnostic method for primary tumor–node–metastasis staging compared with histology and its impact on therapeutic decisions. Experimental Design: We investigated 122 patients with PSMA-PET/MRI prior to planned radical prostatectomy (RP). Primary endpoint was the accuracy of PSMA-PET/MRI in tumor staging as compared with staging-relevant histology. In addition, a multidisciplinary team reassessed the initial therapeutic approach to evaluate its impact on the therapeutic management. Results: PSMA-PET/MRI correctly identified prostate cancer in 119 of 122 patients (97.5%). Eighty-one patients were treated with RP and pelvic lymphadenectomy. The accuracy for T staging was 82.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 73–90; P &lt; 0.001], for T2 stage was 85% (95% CI, 71–94; P &lt; 0.001), for T3a stage was 79% (95% CI, 43–85; P &lt; 0.001), for T3b stage was 94% (95% CI, 73–100; P &lt; 0.001), and for N1 stage was 93% (95% CI, 84–98; P &lt; 0.001). PSMA-PET/MRI changed the therapeutic strategy in 28.7% of the patients with either the onset of systemic therapy/radiotherapy (n ¼ 16) or active surveillance (n ¼ 19). Conclusions: PSMA-PET/MRI can provide an accurate staging of newly diagnosed prostate cancer. In addition, treatment strategies were changed in almost a third of the patients due to the information of this hybrid imaging technique. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Eastern Africa. Diagnostic delays in low-resource countries result in advanced disease presentation. We describe perioperative management of gastric cancer in Rwanda. Methods: A retrospective review of records at three hospitals was performed to identify gastric adenocarcinoma cases from January 2012 to June 2016. Multiple perioperative and tumor-related variables were collected. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed. Results: The final analysis included 229 patients with gastric cancer. Median age was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR] 49-65) and 49.6% were female (n = 114). Patients reported symptoms (ie, weight loss, epigastric pain) for a median time of 12 months (IQR 7.5-24). On presentation, 18.8% (n = 43) had gastric outlet obstruction; 13.5% (n = 31) had a palpable mass. Fifty-one percent (n = 117) underwent an operation; of these, 74% (n = 86) received gastrojejunostomy or were inoperable; and 29% (n = 34) underwent curative resection. Palliative care referrals were made for 9% (n = 20). Pathology reports were available for 190 patients (83.0%). Only 11.3% (n = 26) had Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) testing of which 65.4% tested positive (n = 17). Conclusions: A majority of patients presented with advanced disease. Very few patients had a curative resection. Significant advances in diagnosis and treatment are needed to improve the care of gastric cancer patients in Rwanda. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Chromosome 4q12 and 17q12 have been identified as two regions associated with susceptibility to cervical cancer in a genome-wide association study. To identify potential causal variants within these two regions, we conducted a case-control study including 1486 patients with cervical cancer and 1536 age-matched (±5 years) healthy controls. Based on RegulomeDB database, 12 potentially functional variants were selected and then genotyped by using Sequenom MassARRAY. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations. We found that the G allele of rs8076131 and the A allele of rs12150079 in 17q12 region were significantly associated with increased risk of cervical cancer (adjusted OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02–1.30, P = 0.02 for rs8076131; adjusted OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.03–1.36, P = 0.02 for rs12150079). Individuals with 3–4 risk alleles of these two variants had 24% higher odds of cervical cancer than those without the risk alleles (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.07–1.44, P < 0.01). The stratified analysis showed that the associations of rs8076131 and rs12150079 with cervical cancer risk were statistically significant in subgroups of older menarche age (>16 years), more parities (≥2), nonsmokers, and having no family cancer history, but the test results for subgroup heterogeneity were not significant. The current study provides the evidence that rs8076131 and rs12150079 in 17q12 region may contribute to cervical cancer susceptibility in the Han Chinese population. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Metastasis is the major cause of mortality in prostate cancer patients. Factors such as genetic makeup and race play critical role in the outcome of therapies. This study was conducted to investigate the relevance of BMI1 in metastatic prostate cancer disease in Caucasian and African-Americans. Experimental Design: We employed race-specific prostate cancer models, clinical specimens, clinical data mining, gene-microarray, transcription-reporter assay, chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), IHC, transgenic-(tgfl/fl) zebrafish, and mouse metastasis models. Results: BMI1 expression was observed to be elevated in metastatic tumors (lymph nodes, lungs, bones, liver) of Caucasian and African-American prostate cancer patients. The comparative analysis of stage III/IV tumors showed an increased BMI1 expression in African-Americans than Caucasians. TCGA and NIH/GEO clinical data corroborated to our findings. We show that BMI1 expression (i) positively correlates to metastatic (MYC, VEGF, cyclin D1) and (ii) negative correlates to tumor suppressor (INKF4A/p16, PTEN) levels in tumors. The correlation was prominent in African-American tumors. We show that BMI1 regulates the transcriptional activation of MYC, VEGF, INKF4A/p16, and PTEN. We show the effect of pharmacological inhibition of BMI1 on the metastatic genome and invasiveness of tumor cells. Next, we show the anti-metastatic efficacy of BMI1-inhibitor in transgenic zebrafish and mouse metastasis models. Docetaxel as monotherapy has poor outcome on the growth of metastatic tumors. BMI1 inhibitor as an adjuvant improved the taxane therapy in race-based in vitro and in vivo models. Conclusions: BMI1, a major driver of metastasis, represents a promising therapeutic target for treating advanced prostate cancer in patients (including those belonging to high-risk group). © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Identification of alternative open reading frame-encoded peptides (AEPs) for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer at the proteome level is largely unexplored because of a lack of comprehensive proteomics data. Here, we performed a comprehensive integrative analysis of mass spectral data published by Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium and characterized 93 high-confident AEPs encoded within 75 genes. There are four cancer-related genes appeared to have AEPs identified frequently in >20 out of 95 colorectal cancer samples, including ABCF2, AR, RBM10 and NRG1. Further network analysis of the identified AEPs found the enrichment of novel AEPs within hormone androgen receptor and a highly-modularised network with 42 genes associated with patient survival. Our results not only suggested a mechanistic view of how AEPs work in cancer progression, but also shed light on somatic amino acid mutations in AEPs, which might be overlooked previously because of their low frequencies.

    "Abstract": "The present effort deals with the discovery of highly potent pyrazole bearing quinoline a novel lead for breast cancer chemotherapy. The target molecules were synthesized by 8-hydroxyquinoline and allyl chloride as precursors under basic medium followed by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction with benzaldehyde phenyl hydrazone under ethanol solvent medium. This reaction route cultivates many advantages such as easy work-up and environment friendly solvent system. At the same time they structurally characterized by1H-NMR,13C-NMR, IR spectral data and elemental analysis. In addition to that, the newly obtained compounds were screened for anti-breast cancer activity. Although the cytotoxicity of the obtained analogs was determined using human breast tumor cell lines MCF7, compounds 4b, 4c showed very good effect on MCF7 cancer cells and further, they may helpf to develop a perfect lead for breast cancer MCF7 cell line. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Dietary garlic has been suggested to possess anticancer properties, and several attempts have been made to isolate the anticancer compounds. In this study, we efficiently synthesized N-benzyl-N-methyl-dodecan-1-amine (BMDA) by the reductive amination method. We evaluated the potential anticancer activities of BMDA against A549 lung cancer cells with cancer stem cell-like phenotypes due to the overexpression of cancer upregulated gene (CUG)2. N-Benzyl-N-methyl-dodecan-1-amine treatment sensitized A549 cells overexpressing CUG2 (A549-CUG2) to apoptosis and autophagy compared with those of the control cells. The treatment with BMDA also reduced tumor development in xenografted nude mice. Furthermore, BMDA inhibited cell migration, invasion, and sphere formation in A549-CUG2 cells, in which TGF-β signaling is involved. Further analysis showed that BMDA hindered TGF-β promoter activity, protein synthesis, and phosphorylation of Smad2, thus decreasing the expression of TGF-β-targeted proteins, including Snail and Twist. N-Benzyl-N-methyl-dodecan-1-amine also decreased Twist expression in vivo. In addition, BMDA inhibited Akt-ERK activities, β-catenin expression, and its transcriptional activity. These results suggest that BMDA can be a promising anticancer agent against cancer cells overexpressing CUG2. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer (PaC) has been well-established, while radiation plays ambiguous roles. This international large-scale population-based study aimed to investigate the real-world application of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for resected and unresected PaC in Europe and USA. Population-based data from multiple European national cancer registries and the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-18 database during 2003–2014 were analyzed. Temporal trends and geographical variations in the application rates of chemotherapy and radiotherapy were quantified using age standardization. Associations of treatment with demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 141,533 PaC patients were analyzed. From 2003–2005 to 2012–2014, chemotherapy administration rates increased in most countries and more strongly among resected patients, while radiation rates were generally low with a slight decline or no obvious trend. In 2012–2014, 12.5% (Estonia) to 61.7% (Belgium) of resected and 17.1% (Slovenia) to 56.9% (Belgium) of unresected patients received chemotherapy. Radiation was administered in 2.6% (Netherlands) to 32.6% (USA) of resected and 1.0% (USA) to 6.0% (Belgium) of unresected patients. Strong temporal and geographical variations were observed. Patterns and strengths of associations of treatment administration with various demographic and clinical factors differed substantially between resected and unresected cancers and varied greatly across countries. Conclusively, administration of chemotherapy but not radiotherapy for PaC increased during the last decade in Europe and USA. Treatment rates were low and the uptake strongly varied across countries, highlighting the need for standardization in PaC treatment to improve patient care. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is used to allow more limited breast surgery without compromising local control. We sought to evaluate nationwide surgical trends in patients with operable breast cancer treated with NAC and factors associated with surgical type. We used the National Cancer Database to identify 235,339 women with unilateral T1-3 N0-3 M0 breast cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 and treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Of these, 59,568 patients (25.3%) were treated with NAC. Rates of pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC increased from 33.3% at the start of the study period in 2010 to 46.3% at the end of the period in 2014 (p = 0.02). Rates of breast-conserving surgery (BSC) changed little, from 37.0 to 40.8% (p = 0.22). Although rates of unilateral mastectomy decreased from 43.3 to 34.7% (p = 0.02) and rates of bilateral mastectomy without immediate reconstruction remained similar (11.7–11.5%; p = 0.82), rates of bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction rose from 8.0 to 13.1% (p = 0.02). Patients who were younger, with private/managed care insurance, and diagnosed in more recent years were more likely to achieve pCR; however, these same characteristics were associated with receipt of bilateral mastectomy (vs. BCS). In addition, non-Hispanic white ethnic and higher area education attainment were both associated with bilateral mastectomy. These findings did not differ by age or molecular subtype. Further study of nonclinical factors that influence selection of more extensive surgery despite excellent response to NAC is warranted. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are among the most common causes of mortality worldwide, preceded only by ischemic heart disease (IHD). Thrombocytopenia was shown to be associated with poor outcomes in IHD and CVD in the general population. This study aimed to assess the relationship of thrombocytopenia with poor outcomes in cancer patients with CVD. Materials and methods: Data on patients with concomitant CVD and cancer who were initially treated at a cancer referral center between January 2010 and December 2017 were included. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count &lt; 150,000/mm3 during the first 24 h of CVD symptom onset. The IRB (CI/837/17) approved the review of clinical records. Results: Among 268 cancer patients with CVD included in the study, 210 met the inclusion criteria. Median overall survival of the entire cohort was 7.2 months, which was significantly shorter in males (p = 0.029) and patients with hematologic tumors (p = 0.009), hemorrhagic CVD (p &lt; 0.001), altered mental status (p &lt; 0.001), and thrombocytopenia (p &lt; 0.001). Multiple regression logistic analysis revealed that thrombocytopenia (risk ratio [RR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–2.4) and altered mental status (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.9–4.0) remained statistically significant risk factors for mortality. Conclusion: In cancer patients with CVD, thrombocytopenia at the time of CVD diagnosis and altered mental status during initial clinical evaluation were associated with higher mortality, which should be confirmed in future studies. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor hypoxia is a major mechanism of resistance to radiation therapy (RT), which is associated with poor prognosis in affected cancer patients. Various approaches to treat hypoxic and radioresistant cancers, including pancreatic cancer, have shown limited success. Fucoidan, a polysaccharide from brown seaweed, has antitumor and antiangiogenesis activities. Here, we discuss the development of fucoidan-coated manganese dioxide nanoparticles (Fuco-MnO 2 -NPs) and testing of the therapeutic potential with RT using pancreatic cancer models. In vitro data showed that Fuco-MnO 2 -NPs generated oxygen efficiently in the presence of H 2 O 2 and substantially suppressed HIF-1 expression under a hypoxic condition in human pancreatic cancer cells. Fuco-MnO 2 -NPs reversed hypoxia-induced radioresistance by decreasing clonogenic survival and increasing DNA damage and apoptotic cell death in response to RT. In a BxPC3 xenograft mouse model, the combination treatment with Fuco-MnO 2 -NPs and RT resulted in a greater tumor growth delay than RT alone. Fucoidan-coated NPs, but not naked ones, further suppressed tumor angiogenesis, as judged by immunohistochemistry data with diminished expression of phosphorylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and CD31. These data suggest that Fuco-MnO 2 -NPs may potentiate the effects of RT via dual targeting of tumor hypoxia and angiogenesis, and they are of great clinical potential in the treatment of hypoxic, radioresistant pancreatic cancer. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Expression of cytochrome P450-1A1 (CYP1A1) is suppressed under physiologic conditions but is induced (a) by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which can be metabolized by CYP1A1 to carcinogens, and (b) in majority of breast cancers. Hence, phytochemicals or dietary flavonoids, if identified as CYP1A1 inhibitors, may help in preventing PAH-mediated carcinogenesis and breast cancer. Herein, we have investigated the cancer chemopreventive potential of a flavonoid-rich Indian medicinal plant, Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre. Methanolic extract of its seeds inhibits CYP1A1 in CYP1A1-overexpressing normal human HEK293 cells, with IC50 of 0.6 µg/mL. Its secondary metabolites, the furanoflavonoids pongapin/lanceolatin B, inhibit CYP1A1 with IC50 of 20 nM. Although the furanochalcone pongamol inhibits CYP1A1 with IC50 of only 4.4 µM, a semisynthetic pyrazole-derivative P5b, has ∼10-fold improved potency (IC50, 0.49 μM). Pongapin/lanceolatin B and the methanolic extract of P. pinnata seeds protect CYP1A1-overexpressing HEK293 cells from B[a]P-mediated toxicity. Remarkably, they also block the cell cycle of CYP1A1-overexpressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells, at the G0-G1 phase, repress cyclin D1 levels and induce cellular-senescence. Molecular modeling studies demonstrate the interaction pattern of pongapin/lanceolatin B with CYP1A1. The results strongly indicate the potential of methanolic seed-extract and pongapin/lanceolatin B for further development as cancer chemopreventive agents. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Although anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy has shown light in treatment of gastric cancer, only a limited number of patients respond to the treatment. In addition to its immunosuppressive effect, PD-L1 is involved in other functions of tumor cells. Previously study showed that PD-L1 promoted EMT in lung cancer cells. However, the other effect and role of PD-L1 in gastric cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we first demonstrated that PD-L1 promoted the proliferation and migration in gastric cancer cell lines. We found that another STAT family member, STAT5a, is involved in regulating the expression of PD-L1 in gastric cancer. Additionally, Cbl-b interacted and ubiquitated STAT5a, down-regulated the expression of STAT5a and PD-L1. Moreover, bioinformatics predictions and experimental data showed that Cbl-b is a target gene of the microRNA miR-940. We further found that miR-940 promoted the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-940/Cbl-b/STAT5a axis regulated the expression of PD-L1, which promotes the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This study reports the synthesis and application of new saponin (SAP)-loaded montmorillonite-human serum albumin (Mt-HSA) nanocomposites (NCs) as an anticancer drug delivery agent. When the biodegradable and biofriendly HSA was combined with Mt., which possesses excellent mucoadhesive properties, the resulting NCs could pass through the gastrointestinal barrier easily. SAP-Mt-HSA NCs were prepared by a modified desolvation technique in which ethanol and glutaraldehyde (GA) were used as precipitating and crosslinking agents, respectively. The efficacy of these NCs was assessed in a colorectal cancer cell line (DLD-1) as an in-vitro gastrointestinal model and L929 fibroblast cells as a healthy cell model. The release profile of SAP and the cytotoxic effect and cellular uptake of NCs were evaluated. The results clearly demonstrated that SAP-Mt-HSA NCs can induce dose-dependent cancer cell death with little or no toxicity toward healthy cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Bone is a common site of metastasis for breast, prostate, lung, kidney and other cancers. Bone metastases are incurable, and substantially reduce patient quality of life. To date, there exists no small-molecule therapeutic agent that can reduce tumor burden in bone. This is partly attributed to the lack of suitable in vitro assays that are good models of tumor growth in bone. Here, we take advantage of a novel ex vivo model of bone colonization to report a series of pyrrolopyrazolone small molecules that inhibit cancer cell invasion and ex vivo tumor growth in bone at single-digit micromolar concentration. We find that the compounds modulated the expression levels of genes associated with bone-forming osteoblasts, bone-destroying osteoclasts, cancer cell viability and metastasis. Our compounds provide chemical tools to uncover novel targets and pathways associated with bone metastasis, as well as for the development of compounds to prevent and reverse bone tumor growth in vivo. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Tumor cells exist in close proximity with non-malignant cells. Extensive and multilayered crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells tailors the tumor microenvironment (TME) to support survival, growth, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are one of the largest populations of non-malignant host cells that can be found within the TME of breast, pancreatic, and prostate tumors. Substantial scientific evidence has shown that these cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are not only associated with tumors by proximity but are also actively recruited to developing tumors where they can influence other cells of the TME as well as influencing tumor cell survival and metastasis. This review discusses the impact of CAFs on breast cancer biology and highlights their heterogeneity, origin and their role in tumor progression, ECM remodeling, therapy resistance, metastasis, and the challenges ahead of targeting CAFs to improve therapy response. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chromatin modification at mitosis is closely related to transcriptional reactivation in the subsequent cell cycle. We reasoned this process is deregulated by oncogenic signals, which would contribute to mitotic stress resistance in pancreatic cancer. Here, we show DMAP1/Bub3 complex mediates mitotic stress-induced cellular apoptosis, while this effect is counteracted by c-Src in pancreatic cancer cells. Our study aims to uncover an unidentified mechanism underlying the distinct response to mitotic stress between normal cells and pancreatic cancer cells. Methods: The interaction between Bub3 and DMAP1 upon mitotic stress signaling was determined through molecular and cell biological methods. The inhibitory effect of c-Src on DMAP1/Bub3-mediated DNA methylation and gene transcription profile was investigated. The association between c-Src-mediated DMAP1 phosphorylation and paclitaxel activity in vivo and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. Results: Mitotic arrest induced p38-dependent phosphorylation of Bub3 at Ser211, which promotes DMAP1/Bub3 interaction. DMAP1/Bub3 complex is recruited by TAp73 to the promoter of anti-apoptotic gene BCL2L1, thus mediates the DNA methylation and represses gene transcription linked to cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, DMAP1 was highly phosphorylated at Tyr 246 by c-Src in pancreatic cancer cells, which impedes DMAP1/Bub3 interaction and the relevant cellular activites. Blocking DMAP1 pTyr-246 potentiates paclitaxel-inhibited tumor growth. Clinically, DMAP1 Tyr 246 phosphorylation correlates with c-Src activity in human pancreatic cancer specimens and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a regulatory role of Bub3 in DMAP1-mediated DNA methylation upon mitotic stress and provide the relevance of DMAP1 pTyr-246 to mitotic stress resistance during pancreatic cancer treatment. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The study of the cancer secretome suggests that a fraction of the intracellular proteome could play unanticipated roles in the extracellular space during tumorigenesis. A project aimed at investigating the invasive secretome led us to study the alternative extracellular function of the nuclear protein high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) in breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Experimental Design: Antibodies against HMGA1 were tested in signaling, adhesion, migration, invasion, and metastasis assays using breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models. Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the subcellular localization of HMGA1 in cell lines, xenograft, and patient-derived xenograft models. A cohort of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients was used to study the correlation between subcellular localization of HMGA1 and the incidence of metastasis. Results: Our data show that treatment of invasive cells with HMGA1-blocking antibodies in the extracellular space impairs their migration and invasion abilities. We also prove that extracellular HMGA1 (eHMGA1) becomes a ligand for the Advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (RAGE), inducing pERK signaling and increasing migration and invasion. Using the cytoplasmic localization of HMGA1 as a surrogate marker of secretion, we showed that eHMGA1 correlates with the incidence of metastasis in a cohort of TNBC patients. Furthermore, we show that HMGA1 is enriched in the cytoplasm of tumor cells at the invasive front of primary tumors and in metastatic lesions in xenograft models. Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that eHMGA1 could become a novel drug target in metastatic TNBC and a biomarker predicting the onset of distant metastasis. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy is one of the leading treatments for clinical cancer therapy. External beam radiotherapy has been proposed as an adjuvant treatment for patients bearing differentiated thyroid cancer refractory to conventional therapy. Our purpose was to study the combined effect of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) and ionizing irradiation in thyroid cancer cell lines (Nthy-ori 3-1, WRO, TPC-1 and 8505c). HDACi radiosensitized thyroid cancer cells as evidenced by the reduction of survival fraction, whereas they had no effect in the normal cells. HDACi enhanced radiation-induced cell death in WRO cells. Gamma-H2AX foci number increased and persisted long after ionizing exposure in the HDACi-treated cells (WRO and TPC-1). Moreover, the expression of the repair-related gene Ku80 was differentially modulated only in the cancer cells, by the compounds at the protein and/or mRNA levels. We present in vitro evidence that HDACi can enhance the radiosensitivity of human thyroid cancer cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: We compared the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic and open spleen-preserving splenic hilar lymphadenectomy (LSPL and OSPL) for gastric cancer. Methods: We performed a single-center, randomized, controlled trial to compare the short-term surgical outcomes between LSPL and OSPL. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02980861). Results: A total of 222 patients were enrolled (114 in the LSPL group and 108 in the OSPL group). There were no significant differences between the two groups in operative time (P = 0.152), a number of harvested lymph nodes (P = 0.669) including no. 10 lymph nodes (2.1 ± 1.4 vs 2.3 ± 1.2, P = 0.713). The time taken for no. 10 lymph node dissection was similar in both groups (13.9 ± 10.4 vs 15.2 ± 9.4 minutes, P = 0.217); however, the LSPL group experienced less total blood loss (P < 0.001) and less blood loss during no. 10 lymph node dissection compared with the OSPL group (15.3 ± 37.8 vs 29.5 ± 36.4 mL, P < 0.001). The postoperative complication rates of LSPL and OSPL were 18.3% and 16.1%, respectively (P = 0.331). Conclusion: LSPL is a safe and feasible surgical procedure in no. 10 LN dissection for patients with advanced proximal gastric cancer. Thus, this prospective trial is continuing. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA-98(miR-98) has been shown to be critical for tumorigenesis, however its involvement in bladder cancer are unclear. The present study aims to investigate the expression, biological roles and potential mechanisms of miR-98 in human bladder cancer. We found that miR-98 was upregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. In addition, miR-98 expression was higher in bladder cancer cell lines than in uroepithelial cell line SV-HUC-1. Functional studies revealed that miR-98 mimic promoted proliferation of T24 cells while miR-98 inhibitor inhibited proliferation of BIU-87 cells. Moreover, miR-98 mimic increased cisplatin/doxorubicin resistance and inhibited apoptosis in T24 cells, while miR-98 inhibitor decreased chemoresistance and facilitated apoptosis in BIU-87 cells. Further experiments using MitoTracker and JC-1 staining showed that miR-98 could regulate mitochondrial fission/fusion balance and mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blot showed that miR-98 upregulated cyclin D1, p-Drp1 and Drp1. Using luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that LASS2 acted as a direct target of miR-98. LASS2 overexpression induced mitochondrial fusion and downregulated mitochondrial potential, with decreased p-Drp1 status. Additionally, LASS2 siRNA abrogated the effects of miR-98 mimic on Drp1phosphorylation and chemoresistance. We also found a negative correlation between LASS2 and miR-98 in bladder cancer tissues. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-98 targets LASS2 and regulates bladder cancer chemoresistance through modulation of mitochondrial function. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Osimertinib was initially approved for T790M-positive non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, more recently, for first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. However, resistance mechanisms to osimertinib have been incompletely described. Experimental Design: Using cohorts from The University of Texas MD Anderson Lung Cancer Moonshot GEMINI and Moffitt Cancer Center lung cancer databases, we collected clinical data for patients treated with osimertinib. Molecular profiling analysis was performed at the time of progression in a subset of the patients. Results: In the 118 patients treated with osimertinib, 42 had molecular profiling at progression. T790M was preserved in 21 (50%) patients and lost in 21 (50%). EGFR C797 and L792 (26%) mutations were the most common resistance mechanism and were observed exclusively in T790M-preserved cases. MET amplification was the second most common alteration (14%). Recurrent alterations were observed in 22 genes/ pathways, including PIK3CA, FGFR, and RET. Preclinical studies confirmed MET, PIK3CA, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as potential resistance drivers. Alterations of cell-cycle genes were associated with shorter median progression-free survival (PFS, 4.4 vs. 8.8 months, P ¼ 0.01). In 76 patients with progression, osimertinib was continued in 47 cases with a median second PFS (PFS2) of 12.6 months; 21 patients received local consolidation radiation with a median PFS of 15.5 months. Continuation of osimertinib beyond progression was associated with a longer overall survival compared with discontinuation (11.2 vs. 6.1 months, P ¼ 0.02). Conclusions: Osimertinib resistance is associated with diverse, predominantly EGFR-independent genomic alterations. Continuation of osimertinib after progression, alone or in conjunction with radiotherapy, may provide prolonged clinical benefit in selected patients. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Our study aimed to explore the relationship between CD36 methylation and the development of lung cancer and investigate the effect of combine treatment of Decitabine and Chidamide in lung cancer. Methods: The differentially expression genes in tumor samples and normal samples were determined by microarray analysis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to analyze gene expression data of lung cancer and the hub genes were screened in the modules. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was conducted to detect the methylation level of CD36 in lung cancer cells. QRT-PCR analysis and western blotting were performed to explore the relative mRNA expression and protein level. MTT assays, wound healing assay, Transwell assays and flow cytometry were conducted to clarify the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle of lung carcinoma cell lines in vitro respectively. By xenograft and immunohistochemistry, the effect of co-treatment of Decitabine and Chidamide was further verified in vivo. Results: The heatmap displayed that the top 20 differential mRNA-expression gene in lung cancer tissues and normal tissues in which CD36 was low expressed in the tumor samples and high expressed in the normal samples. By WGCNA, CD36 was selected to be the hub gene in the brown module. And then CD36 was confirmed to be differential expressed and hypermethylated in lung cancer through qRT-PCR and western blotting. CD36 inhibited the lung cancer cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, blocked cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, and inhibited cell migration. What's more, we found that Decitabine (DCTB) and Chidamide (CDM) co-treatment induced de-methylation and re-expression of silenced CD36 by conducting the vivo experiments. DCTB + CDM co-treatment synergistically suppressed tumor growth. Conclusion: Our results showed that the high methylation of CD36 in lung cancer played an important role in the procession of lung cancer and Decitabine joint Chidamide had obvious effect of inhibiting the growth of lung tumor. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Identification of novel strategies to expand the use of PARP inhibitors beyond BRCA deficiency is of great interest in personalized medicine. Here, we investigated the unannotated role of Kub5-Hera RPRD1B (K-H) in homologous recombination (HR) repair and its potential clinical significance in targeted cancer therapy. Experimental Design: Functional characterization of K-H alterations on HR repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) were assessed by targeted gene silencing, plasmid reporter assays, immunofluorescence, and Western blots. Cell survival with PARP inhibitors was evaluated through colony-forming assays and statistically analyzed for correlation with K-H expression in various BRCA1/2 nonmutated breast cancers. Gene expression microarray/qPCR analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments were used to investigate molecular mechanisms of action. Results: K-H expression loss correlates with rucaparib LD 50 values in a panel of BRCA1/2 nonmutated breast cancers. Mechanistically, K-H depletion promotes BRCAness, where extensive upregulation of PARP1 activity was required for the survival of breast cancer cells. PARP inhibition in these cells led to synthetic lethality that was rescued by wild-type K-H reexpression, but not by a mutant K-H (p.R106A) that weakly binds RNAPII. K-H mediates HR by facilitating recruitment of RNAPII to the promoter region of a critical DNA damage response and repair effector, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Conclusions: Cancer cells with low K-H expression may have exploitable BRCAness properties that greatly expand the use of PARP inhibitors beyond BRCA mutations. Our results suggest that aberrant K-H alterations may have vital translational implications in cellular responses/survival to DNA damage, carcinogenesis, and personalized medicine. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "The role of Hedgehog (HH)/ glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancer entities, and the targeted pathway inhibition mediated by GLI1 is of therapeutic relevance. However, its oncogenicity and cross-talks with other cancer pathways including PI3K/Akt/NFκB, which modulates the HH/GLI1 signal strength, have rarely been explored in colorectal adenocarcinoma. We assessed the expression of GLI1 and its relationship with other cancer stemness genes, cell cycle markers, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling pathway genes, and HIF1α in 100 paraffin-embedded colorectal adenocarcinoma tissue samples using immunohistochemistry. We further addressed the effect of GLI1 on EMT, cell cycle, and its putative interaction with the PI3K/Akt/NFκB cascade in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. The expression of GLI1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues was found to correlate with the clinical stages, and distant metastasis. Moreover, GLI1 was found to be an independent predictor of poor overall survival and disease-free survival in colorectal adenocarcinoma. GLI1-expressing cancer cells also expressed their representative cancer stem-like cell (CSC) markers (SOX9 and CD133), as well as HIF1α. GLI1 expression was also strongly linked to EMT-related and PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling genes. Downregulation of GLI1 by inhibitor treatment in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines resulted in reduced expression of CSC markers, cell clonogenicity, S-phase subpopulations, as well as the migration and invasion ability. Importantly, Akt inhibitor Perifosine significantly inhibited the expression of pAkt and GLI1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Combination of GLI1 inhibitor GANT61 and NFκB p65 inhibitor QZN exhibited much higher inhibition compared to using any of them individually on colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. We suggested that GLI1 may be a novel stem cell marker, and cancer stemness was activated via PI3K/Akt/NFκB pathway. In addition, co-targeting GLI1 and PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling simultaneously might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for colorectal adenocarcinoma patients. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Chemoradiation therapy is the mainstay for treatment of locally advanced, borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Pharmacologic ascorbate (P-AscH, i.e., intravenous infusions of ascorbic acid, vitamin C), but not oral ascorbate, produces high plasma concentrations capable of selective cytotoxicity to tumor cells. In doses achievable in humans, P-AscH decreases the viability and proliferative capacity of pancreatic cancer via a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that P-AscH radiosensitizes pancreatic cancer cells but inhibits radiation-induced damage to normal cells. Specifically, radiation-induced decreases in clonogenic survival and double-stranded DNA breaks in tumor cells, but not in normal cells, were enhanced by P-AscH, while radiation-induced intestinal damage, collagen deposition, and oxidative stress were also reduced with P-AscH in normal tissue. We also report on our first-in-human phase I trial that infused P-AscH during the radiotherapy \"beam on.\" Specifically, treatment with P-AscH increased median overall survival compared with our institutional average (21.7 vs. 12.7 months, P ¼ 0.08) and the E4201 trial (21.7 vs. 11.1 months). Progression-free survival in P-AscH–treated subjects was also greater than our institutional average (13.7 vs. 4.6 months, P &lt; 0.05) and the E4201 trial (6.0 months). Results indicated that P-AscH in combination with gemcitabine and radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma is safe and well tolerated with suggestions of efficacy. Because of the potential effect size and minimal toxicity, our findings suggest that investigation of P-AscH efficacy is warranted in a phase II clinical trial. Significance: These findings demonstrate that pharmacologic ascorbate enhances pancreatic tumor cell radiation cytotoxicity in addition to offering potential protection from radiation damage in normal surrounding tissue, making it an optimal agent for improving treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a deadly disease with high incidence worldwide in recent years. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to play imperative roles in many biological processes, such as cancer development and progression. Specifically, TP73-AS1, a novel cancer-related lncRNA, was documented to be up-regulated in several malignancies, but the clinical significance and functional role of TP73-AS1 in GC is still unknown. RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate TP73-AS1 transcription in GC tissue specimens and cell lines. In addition, the correlation between TP73-AS1 transcription and clinicopathologic features was further evaluated. Moreover, the effects of TP73-AS1 on GC cell were measured in vitro and in vivo. The data documented that TP73-AS1 was enhanced in GC tissues and cells, and TP73-AS1 transcription level was tightly associated with tumor size, TNM stage, and overall survival in 76 GC patients. What's more, decreased TP73-AS1 could restrain cell growth and colony-forming capacity and promoted apoptosis partly by regulating Bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway. Importantly, TP73-AS1 could promote xenograft growth in vivo. Silencing of TP73-AS1 inhibited GC cell migratory and invasive properties partly by reversing snail-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Collectively, this study may help to develop the treatment strategy for GC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Testosterone suppression in prostate cancer is limited by serious side effects and resistance via restoration of androgen receptor (AR) functionality. ELK1 is required for AR-dependent growth in various hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer models. The amino-terminal domain of AR docks at two sites on ELK1 to coactivate essential growth genes. This study explores the ability of small molecules to disrupt the ELK1–AR interaction in the spectrum of prostate cancer, inhibiting AR activity in a manner that would predict functional tumor selectivity. Experimental Design: Small-molecule drug discovery and extensive biological characterization of a lead compound. Results: We have discovered a lead molecule (KCI807) that selectively disrupts ELK1-dependent promoter activation by wild-type and variant ARs without interfering with ELK1 activation by ERK. KCI807 has an obligatory flavone scaffold and functional hydroxyl groups on C5 and C3'. KCI807 binds to AR, blocking ELK1 binding, and selectively blocks recruitment of AR to chromatin by ELK1. KCI807 primarily affects a subset of AR target growth genes selectively suppressing AR-dependent growth of prostate cancer cell lines with a better inhibitory profile than enzalutamide. KCI807 also inhibits in vivo growth of castration/enzalutamide-resistant cell line–derived and patient-derived tumor xenografts. In the rodent model, KCI807 has a plasma half-life of 6 hours, and maintenance of its antitumor effect is limited by self-induced metabolism at its 3 0 -hydroxyl. Conclusions: The results offer a mechanism-based therapeutic paradigm for disrupting the AR growth-promoting axis in the spectrum of prostate tumors while reducing global suppression of testosterone actions. KCI807 offers a good lead molecule for drug development. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The immune system plays an important role in cancer survival and disease progression, but the role of the immune system in lower grade glioma (LGG) is largely unknown Methods: To investigate the relationship between lymphocyte infiltration into the LGG microenvironment and LGG survival, we used a genomics approach to recover productive V(D)J recombination sequences from primary tumor, whole exome sequence files available via the cancer genome atlas Results: Increased T-cell receptor V(D)J read recovery, indicating increased T-lymphocyte infiltration into the primary tumor site, strongly correlated with decreased overall and disease-free survival; and with a more advanced cancer grade. In addition, this result was more significant than related results obtainable using RNASeq-based, T-cell biomarkers, similar to a recently reported case for pancreatic cancer, where the recovery of BCR recombination reads from WXS files clearly associated with reduced survival, despite the fact that no such association was demonstrable with B-cell based, RNASeq biomarkers Conclusions: Overall, the results presented here support V(D)J recombination read recovery, from whole exome files, as a uniquely useful biomarker for distinct LGG survival rates. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy is under investigation for cancer treatment. Experimental Design: We studied the rationale of such a combination for treating mesothelioma, a disease with limited treatment options. Results: The combination of gemcitabine and immune checkpoint inhibitors outperformed immunotherapy alone with regard to tumor control and survival in a preclinical mesothelioma model; however, the addition of dexamethasone to gemcitabine and immune checkpoint inhibitors nullified the synergistic clinical response. Furthermore, treatment with gemcitabine plus anti-PD-1 resulted in an objective clinical response in two patients with mesothelioma, who were resistant to gemcitabine or anti-PD-1 as monotherapy. Conclusions: Thus, treatment of mesothelioma with a combination of gemcitabine with immune checkpoint inhibitors is feasible and results in synergistic clinical response compared with single treatment in the absence of steroids. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for only a fraction of the proteins that are encoded within the nucleus, and therefore has typically been regarded as a lesser player in cancer biology and metastasis. Accumulating evidence, however, supports an increased role for mtDNA impacting tumor progression and metastatic susceptibility. Unfortunately, due to this delay, there is a dearth of data defining the relative contributions of specific mtDNA polymorphisms (SNP), which leads to an inability to effectively use these polymorphisms to guide and enhance therapeutic strategies and diagnosis. In addition, evidence also suggests that differences in mtDNA impact not only the cancer cells but also the cells within the surrounding tumor microenvironment, suggesting a broad encompassing role for mtDNA polymorphisms in regulating the disease progression. mtDNA may have profound implications in the regulation of cancer biology and metastasis. However, there are still great lengths to go to understand fully its contributions. Thus, herein, we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of mtDNA in cancer and metastasis, providing a framework for future functional validation and discovery. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: We examined prostate cancer patients’ perceived engagement in treatment decision-making and associated factors by race/ethnicity in a multiethnic sample. Method: We identified patients through the California Cancer Registry. Patients completed a cross-sectional telephone interview in English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. Multivariable logistic regression models, stratified by race/ethnicity, estimated the associations of patient demographic and health status characteristics on (1) doctor asked patient to help decide treatment plan and (2) patient and doctor worked out a treatment plan together. Results: We included 855 prostate cancer patients: African American (19%), Asian American (15%), Latino (24%), and White (42%). Asian American patients were less likely than White patients to report that their doctors asked them to help decide a treatment plan (OR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.18–0.53) and that they worked out a treatment plan with their doctors (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.33–0.90). Language of interview was a significant contributing factor in stratified analysis for both outcomes. Conclusion: Asian American prostate cancer patients reported less engagement in treatment decision-making, with Chinese language being a significant contributing factor. Future research should identify patient-centered strategies that effectively engage underserved patients and support healthcare providers in shared decision-making with multiethnic and multilingual patients. © 2018, W.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and over 60% express wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR); however, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have limited effect in most patients with wtEGFR tumors. We previously identified MERTK tyrosine kinase as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC and developed MRX-2843, a novel MERTK-selective inhibitor with favorable properties for clinical translation. The goal of this study was to determine whether MERTK and EGFR inhibitor combination therapy could provide antitumor efficacy against wtEGFR NSCLC. Experimental Design: An unbiased screen of 378 kinase inhibitors was conducted to identify synergistic interactions with MRX-2843 and biochemical and therapeutic effects were determined in vitro and in vivo. Results: Numerous irreversible EGFR TKIs, including CO-1686 and osimertinib, synergized with MRX-2843 to inhibit wtEGFR NSCLC cell expansion, irrespective of driver oncogene status. CO-1686 and MRX-2843 combination therapy inhibited MERTK, wtEGFR, and ERBB2/ ERBB3 and decreased downstream PI3K-AKT, MAPK-ERK, and AURORA kinase (AURK) signaling more effectively than single agents. Inhibition of PI3K, AKT or AURK, but not MEK, synergized with CO-1686 to inhibit tumor cell expansion, suggesting their roles as key redundant resistance pathways. Treatment with MRX-2843 and CO-1686 or osimertinib prevented xenograft growth while single agents had limited effect. Tumor growth inhibition was durable even after treatment with combination therapy was stopped. Conclusions: Our data support the application of MRX-2843 in combination with an irreversible EGFR TKI as a novel strategy for treatment of patients with wtEGFR NSCLC. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer with lack of predictive biomarkers. We conducted a study to assess DNA damage repair (DDR) gene mutations as a predictive biomarker in PDAC patients treated with FOLFIRINOX. Experimental Design: Indiana University Simon Cancer Center pancreatic cancer database was used to identify patients with metastatic PDAC, treated with FOLFIRINOX and had tissue available for DNA sequencing. Baseline demographic, clinical, and pathologic information was gathered. DNA isolation and targeted sequencing was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq protocol. Overall survival (OS) analysis was conducted using Kaplan–Meier, logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard methods. Multivariate models were adjusted for age, gender, margin status, CA 19-9, adjuvant chemotherapy, tumor and nodal stage. Results: Overall, 36 patients were sequenced. DDR gene mutations were found in 12 patients. Mutations were seen in BRCA1 (N ¼ 7), BRCA2 (N ¼ 5), PALB2 (N ¼ 3), MSH2 (N ¼ 1), and FANCF (N ¼ 1) of all the DDR genes sequenced. Median age was 65.5 years, 58% were male, 97.2% were Caucasian and 51.4% had any family history of cancer. The median OS was near significantly superior in those with DDR gene mutations present vs. absent [14 vs. 5 months; HR, 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.29–1.14; log-rank P ¼ 0.08]. Multivariate logistic (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04–2.06; P ¼ 0.04) and Cox regression (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15–0.94; P ¼ 0.04) showed presence of DDR gene mutations was associated with improved OS. Conclusions: In a single institution, retrospective study, we found that the presence of DDR gene mutations are associated with improved OS in PDAC patients treated with FOLFIRINOX. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Despite surgery, many patients experience locoregional recurrence (LR), the optimum treatment of which is still debated. Methods: All 297 consecutive patients operated for a nonmetastatic primary retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RPS) between 1994 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed to report our experience in treating LR. Results: After a median follow-up of 97 months, 55 patients (19%) developed LR. The first site of recurrence was locoregional in 100% with associated peritoneal metastases in 45% and distant metastases in 5%. After LR treatment, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 71%, 46%, and 33%. Low tumor grade, disease-free interval above 24 months, exclusive LR, and well-differentiated liposarcoma were predictive of better OS. The treatment strategy (best supportive care, chemotherapy radiotherapy, and/or surgery) was not statistically significant. Fourteen patients underwent initial surveillance (strategic delay) for low-grade LR and eventually required treatment in 86% after a median delay of 20 months during which no patient developed distant metastases. Conclusions: The management of LR in RPS is complex. An initial surveillance may not alter survival in asymptomatic low-grade and slow-growing LR. An LR decision scheme is proposed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Breast Cancer Screening Program was introduced and rolled out in Morocco in 2010. Women between 40 and 69 years are screened at the primary health centers (PHC) with clinical breast examination (CBE). A comprehensive evaluation of the program was conducted in 2016–2017 for quality assurance and mid-term course correction. The evaluation process involved: in-depth interviews of program managers; focus group discussions with service-providers of screening, diagnosis and treatment; supportive supervisory visits to randomly selected PHCs and diagnostic centers; desk review of the national guidelines and other published documents; and analysis of the performance data compiled by the program-in-charge. We found that the program has strong political support, a well-organized management structure and documented national policy and protocol. In absence of a mechanism to identify and invite the eligible women individually, the program is opportunistic in nature. Every PHC is provided with an annual target to be screened. A highly visible annual campaign to educate and motivate women has a major impact on participation. Record keeping and data collection are paper-based. In the years 2015 and 2016, 1.1 and 1.5 million women were screened, respectively. In the year 2015, 62.8% of the annual target population was covered, CBE positivity was 3.2%, a further assessment rate of screen-positive women was 34.1% and the breast cancer detection rate was 1.0/1000 women. Systematic paper-based data collection enabled the assessment of some of the process and outcome indicators. The screening coverage was moderate and the cancer detection rate was low. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, and adjuvant targeted therapy has shown great benefits for the NSCLC patients with specific genomic mutations. Alectinib, a selective anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, has been clinically used for the NSCLC patients with ALK-rearrangement, however, irreversible therapeutic resistance for the patients receiving alectinib treatment frequently occurs. Here we show that neuromedin U (NMU) may confer the alectinib resistance in NSCLC via multiple mechanisms based on the integrative bioinformatics analyses. Through employing the bioinformatics analyses of three microarray datasets, NMU, overexpressed in both NSCLC tissues and alectinib-resistant NSCLC cells, was initially identified as potential candidate for causing alectinib resistance in NSCLC. The resistance function of NMU in NSCLC was validated by performing protein/gene interactions and biological process annotation analyses, and further validated by analyzing the transcription factors targeting NMU mRNA. Collectively, these results indicated that NMU may confer alectinib resistance in NSCLC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "African-American men are more likely than any other racial group to die from prostate cancer. The contribution of acquired genomic variation to this racial disparity is largely unknown, as genomic from Africa is lacking. Here, we performed the first tumor-normal paired deep whole-genome sequencing for Africa. A direct study-matched comparison between African- and European-derived, treatment-naïve, high-risk prostate tumors for 15 cases allowed for further comparative analyses of existing data. Excluding a single hypermutated tumor with 55 mutations per megabase, we observed a 1.8-fold increase in small somatic variants in African- versus European-derived tumors (P ¼ 1.02e–04), rising to 4-fold when compared with published tumor-matched data. Furthermore, we observed an increase in oncogenic driver mutations in African tumors (P ¼ 2.92e–03); roughly 30% of impacted genes were novel to prostate cancer, and 79% of recurrent driver mutations appeared early in tumorigenesis. Although complex genomic rearrangements were less frequent in African tumors, we describe a uniquely hyperduplicated tumor affecting 149 transposable elements. Comparable with African Americans, ERG fusions and PIK3CA mutations were absent and PTEN loss less frequent. CCND1 and MYC were frequently gained, with somatic copy-number changes more likely to occur late in tumorigenesis. In addition to traditional prostate cancer gene pathways, genes regulating calcium ion-ATPase signal transduction were disrupted in African tumors. Although preliminary, our results suggest that further validation and investigation into the potential implications for elevated tumor mutational burden and tumor-initiating mutations in clinically unfavorable prostate cancer can improve patient outcomes in Africa. Significance: The first whole-genome sequencing study for high-risk prostate cancer in African men allows a simultaneous comparison of ethnic differences relative to European populations and of the influences of the environment relative to African-American men.

    "Abstract": "The efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein BCRP/ABCG2 is well-known for its contribution to multi-drug resistance in cancer. Its relevance in cancer biology independent from drug efflux remains largely elusive. Our study aimed at elucidating the biological relevance and regulatory mechanisms of BCRP/ABCG2 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and disease progression. Two independent ccRCC-cohorts [Cohort 1 (KIRC/TCGA): n = 453, Cohort 2: n = 64] were investigated to elucidate BCRP/ABCG2 mRNA and protein expression and their association with survival. The impact of BCRP/ABCG2 on response to sunitinib treatment was investigated in two independent sunitinib-treated ccRCC-cohorts based on mRNA levels. Moreover, underlying regulatory mechanisms for interindividual variability of BCRP/ABCG2 expression were systematically assessed. Owing to redundant functional properties, mRNA and protein expression of the multidrug resistance protein MDR1/ABCB1 were additionally evaluated in these cohorts. In independent ccRCC-cohorts, low BCRP/ABCG2 and MDR1/ABCB1 mRNA and protein expression were associated with severity (e.g., tumor stage) of ccRCC and poor cancer-specific survival. BCRP/ABCG2 and MDR1/ABCB1 mRNA expression were linked to decreased progression-free survival after sunitinib treatment. Germline and somatic variants influenced interindividual variability of BCRP/ABCG2 expression only moderately. miR-212-3p and miR-132-3p were identified to regulate BCRP/ABCG2 posttranscriptionally by interaction with the ABCG2 3′UTR as confirmed through reporter gene assays in RCC cell lines. In summary, BCRP/ABCG2 expression in ccRCC underlies considerable interindividual variability with impact on patient survival and response to sunitinib treatment. While germline or somatic genetic variants and DNA methylation cannot explain aberrant BCRP/ABCG2 expression, miR-212-3p and miR-132-3p were identified to contribute to posttranscriptional regulation of BCRP/ABCG2. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Glutaminolysis has been suggested as a therapeutic target for cancer. Costunolide is a natural sesquiterpene lactone showing potent antitumor activity. Our studies were aimed at evaluating how costunolide affected glutaminolysis leading to proliferation inhibition in human colorectal cancer cells. Costunolide suppressed viability and proliferation of HCT116 cells concentration-dependently, but did not apparently affect human intestinal epithelial cells. Costunolide at 20 μM reduced viability and proliferation of HCT116 cells time-dependently. Costunolide also repressed phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream kinases p70S6K and 4E-BP1. Examinations of glutaminolysis metabolites showed that costunolide increased intracellular glutamine levels, but decreased intracellular levels of glutamate, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and ATP in HCT116 cells, suggesting costunolide blockade of glutaminolysis. Furthermore, costunolide inhibited promoter activity of glutaminase 1 (GLS1), the first rate-limiting enzyme in glutaminolysis, and reduced mRNA and protein expression of GLS1 in HCT116 cells, The GLS1 inhibitor BPTES, similar to costunolide, significantly reduced intracellular levels of α-KG and ATP and inhibited proliferation in HCT116 cells. Finally, costunolide increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p53 in HCT116 cells. Both p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α and p53 siRNA significantly rescued costunolide suppression of GLS1 promoter activity and expression in HCT116 cells. These data in aggregate suggested that activation of p53 was required for costunolide inhibition of GLS1 resulting in blockade of glutaminolysis and inhibition of proliferation in colorectal cancer cells, which was a novel mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of costunolide against colorectal cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The predictive role of biomarkers in colon cancer is still being defined. The aim of this study is to determine the interaction between BRAF mutation and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in determining survival benefit after adjuvant 5-FU based chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study including all curatively resected stage III colon cancer cases over a 33-year period. A clinicopathological database was collated (adjuvant chemotherapy, age, gender, obstruction, perforation, tumor location, grade, mucin, nodal stage, extramural vascular, and perineural invasion). BRAF (V600E) mutation testing was performed and MSI status established by immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins and molecular testing for National Cancer Institute panel markers. Patients were categorized into four groups for comparison: MSS and BRAF−ve (termed “ traditional”), MSI and BRAF−ve (termed “ presumed Lynch”), MSI and BRAF+ve (termed “ sporadic MSI”), and MSS and BRAF+ve (termed “ other BRAF”). The primary endpoint was cancer specific survival. Interaction testing was conducted to determine whether there were different responses to chemotherapy between groups. Results: A total of 686 unselected cases met inclusion criteria and had tissue available, of which 15.7% had BRAF mutation (BRAF+ve) and 13.8% had MSI. Thirty-nine percent received chemotherapy. Overall, adjuvant chemotherapy produced a cancer specific survival benefit (HR 0.66, 95% CI, 0.49-0.88, P < 0.01). On adjusted analysis, neither BRAF nor MSI status were individually predictive of survival benefit. On adjusted analysis specifically of the chemotherapy effect in each subgroup, only patients in the presumed Lynch (HR 0.260, 95% CI, 0.09-0.80, P < 0.01) and other BRAF groups (HR 0.45, 95% CI, 0.23-0.87, P < 0.01) had a significant survival benefit from chemotherapy. On interaction testing of subgroups, adjusting for all the clinicopathological parameters, only patients in the presumed Lynch group (HR 0.277, 95% CI, 0.10-0.75, P < 0.01) gained a differentially greater benefit from chemotherapy than other groups. Conclusions: In this historical cohort, MSI testing is predictive of response to adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer, but only when results are interpreted in combination with BRAF. This supports the role of routine testing for these biomarkers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Genetic alterations and epigenetic modifications are two main factors involved in gastric carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis. Several miRNAs such as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326 may play important role in gastric cancer by targeting the 3′UTR of the caudal type homeobox (CDX) 1 and 2 mRNA respectively. The use of herbal medicines has been widely considered in the treatment of cancers such as gastric cancer. Sulforaphane extracted from broccoli may indirectly prevent cancer through affecting different signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of sulforaphane extracted from broccoli sprout (SEBS) on viability, death pattern, and expression alterations of CDX1/2 as well as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326 in normal (HF2FF) and gastric cancer cell lines. Methods: Two gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and MKN45) and HF2FF normal cell line were cultured and treated with different concentrations (31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 μg/ml) of the purified sulforaphane. Expression levels of CDX1 and CDX2 as well as miRNA-9 and miRNA-326, and mechanisms leading to cell death were assessed by Taqman real time PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: Significant dose-dependent and anti-proliferative effects of the SEBS were observed on AGS and MKN45 cells after 48 h with an IC50 value of about 112 and 125 μg/ml, respectively (P < 0.001). Apoptotic cells were observed in AGS and MKN45 cells but not HF2FF after 48 h of treatment with SEBS. Furthermore, significant changes in expression of CDX1, CDX2, miR-9 and miR-326 in the gastric cancer lines (AGS and MKN45), were observed under different concentrations of SEBS. Conclusion: Our present study suggests that the SEBS may influence gastric cancer cell lines at specific doses and change their proliferation rate by altering the expression of CDX1, CDX2, miR-9, and miR-326. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Epidemiologic research on the role of fibers and other elongate mineral particles (EMP) and human diseases including cancers has generated a large body of literature over the last decades: nevertheless, there remain some questions for which the scientific community appears unable to reach consensus. Reasons for genuine differences in opinion include (i) ways in which exposures have been classified; (ii) methodological limitations of the available studies, (iii) criteria for the interpretation of study results, including potential underlying biological mechanisms, and (iv) methodology for integrating the evidence. Various approaches have been proposed in recent years to address these issues, which will be illustrated using examples from asbestos, talc, taconite, synthetic mineral fibers and silicon carbide, with emphasis on potential carcinogenic effects. Potential solutions include improved exposure and outcome assessment – including use of biomarkers and other molecular approaches, consideration of potential confounding and other sources of bias, implementation of guidelines for study quality assessment and evidence evaluation and integration. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of noncoding RNAs, have recently drawn lots of attention in the pathogenesis of human cancers. However, the role of circRNAs in cancer cells epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify novel circRNAs that regulate urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) cells' EMT and explored their regulatory mechanisms and clinical significance in UCBs. Experimental Design: We first screened circRNA expression profiles using a circRNA microarray in paired UCB and normal tissues, and then studied the clinical significance of an upregulated circRNA, circPRMT5, in a large cohort of patients with UCB. We further investigated the functions and underlying mechanisms of circPRMT5 in UCB cells' EMT. Moreover, we evaluated the regulation effect of circPRMT5 on miR-30c, and its target genes, SNAIL1 and E-cadherin, in two independent cohorts from our institute and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results: We demonstrated that upregulated expression of circPRMT5 was positively associated with advanced clinical stage and worse survival in patients with UCB. We further revealed that circPRMT5 promoted UCB cell's EMT via sponging miR-30c. Clinical analysis from two independent UCB cohorts showed that the circPRMT5/miR-30c/SNAIL1/E-cad-herin pathway was essential in supporting UCB progression. Importantly, we identified that circPRMT5 was upregulated in serum and urine exosomes from patients with UCB, and significantly correlated with tumor metastasis. Conclusions: CircPRMT5 exerts critical roles in promoting UCB cells' EMT and/or aggressiveness and is a prognostic biomarker of the disease, suggesting that circPRMT5 may serve as an exploitable therapeutic target for patients with UCB. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Previous studies on metabolic factors and bladder cancer (BC) risk have shown inconsistent results and have commonly not investigated associations separately by sex, smoking, and tumor invasiveness. Among 811,633 participants in six European cohorts, we investigated sex-specific associations between body mass index (BMI), mid-blood pressure (BP, [systolic + diastolic]/2), plasma glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol and risk of BC overall, non-muscle invasive BC (NMIBC) and muscle invasive BC (MIBC). Among men, we additionally assessed additive interactions between metabolic factors and smoking on BC risk. During follow-up, 2,983 men and 754 women were diagnosed with BC. Among men, triglycerides and BP were positively associated with BC risk overall (hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation [SD]: 1.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.27] and 1.09 [1.02–1.17], respectively), and among women, BMI was inversely associated with risk (HR: 0.90 [0.82–0.99]). The associations for BMI and BP differed between men and women (pinteraction ≤ 0.005). Among men, BMI, cholesterol and triglycerides were positively associated with risk for NMIBC (HRs: 1.09 [95% CI 1.01–1.18], 1.14 [1.02–1.25], and 1.30 [1.12–1.48] respectively), and BP was positively associated with MIBC (HR: 1.23 [1.02–1.49]). Among women, glucose was positively associated with MIBC (HR: 1.99 [1.04–3.81]). Apart from cholesterol, HRs for metabolic factors did not significantly differ between MIBC and NMIBC, and there were no interactions between smoking and metabolic factors on BC. Our study supports an involvement of metabolic aberrations in BC risk. Whilst some associations were significant only in certain sub-groups, there were generally no significant differences in associations by smoking or tumor invasiveness. © 2018 UICC",

Historically, in vitro models of ‘mutagenesis’ and immortalized cell lines were first used to test the theory that EMPs were mutagenic to cells, and ‘genotoxicity’, as defined as damage to DNA often culminating in cell death, was observed in a dose-dependent fashion as responses of many cell types to a number of EMPs. As two-stage and multi-step models of cancer development emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, differentiated 3D organ cultures and monolayers of lung epithelial and mesothelial cells were used to probe the mechanisms of cancer development. These studies demonstrated a spectrum of pre-neoplastic changes, including hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, in response to long (>5 μm in length) needlelike EMPs whereas long, curly chrysotile fibers caused acute cytotoxicity. Shorter fibers of many types were taken up by cells and encompassed in phagolysosomes. Comparative studies using chemical carcinogens showed that chemical agents interacted directly with DNA whereas long EMPs appeared to be promoters of cancers via a number of mechanisms such as inflammation, generation of oxidants, and instigation of cell division. The multitude of these signaling cascades and epigenetic mechanisms of both lung cancers and mesotheliomas have been most recently studied in normal or telomerase immortalized human cells. Importantly, many of these pathways are elicited by long, straight amphibole asbestos fibers or carbon nanotubes in rodents and not by short (<5 μm) EMPs, fragments, or nonfibrous particles. However, the chemistry and surface properties of long fibers are also critical in cell responses to minerals. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Crotoxin (CTX), a heterodimeric phospholipase present in venom of snakes of the genus Crotalus, has demonstrated a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as antimicrobial, hemostatic, and antitumoral. However, the precise mechanism of its cytotoxicity and antitumoral properties remains to be determined. Therefore, in the present study, we isolated crotoxin (F1 CTX) through two steps DEAE-Sepharose and Heparin-Sepharose FF chromatography. The C-terminal sequence of the A- and B-chain protein fragment was determined by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry, which showed 100% identity to crotoxin structure. In order to investigate its cytotoxic effects, we demonstrated that the F1 CTX fraction at 0–30 μg/mL concentrations for 72 h presented a heterogeneous response profile on nine human cancer-derived cell lines from four tumor types (pancreatic, esophagus, cervical cancer, and glioma). The glioma (GAMG and HCB151) and pancreatic (PSN-1 and PANC-1) cancer cells showed a higher sensitivity with IC50 of &lt;0.5, 4.1, 0.7 and &lt; 0.5 μg/mL, respectively. Conversely, F1 CTX does not reduce the viability of normal cells. On the other hand, cervical (SiHa) and esophagus (KYSE270) cancer cell lines presented higher resistance, with IC50 higher than 30.2 and 8.7 μg/mL, respectively. Moreover, F1 CTX did not affect cell cycle distribution under the conditions evaluated and seems to be more cytotoxic than cytostatic. The pro-apoptotic effect of F1 CTX treatment was demonstrated in glioma (HCB151) cell line. In addition, crotoxin revealed a potential to initiate cell responses such as DNA damage in glioma (HCB151) and pancreatic cancer by H2AX activity induction. Conversely, F1 CTX does not reduce the viability of normal cells. Importantly, the comparison of F1 CTX effect with standard chemotherapeutic agents demonstrated a greater cytotoxic potential in the majority of tumor types (glioma, pancreatic, and cervical cancer). On the other hand, F1 CTX was less cytotoxic in esophageal cell lines compared to the gemcitabine agent used in clinical practice. Therefore, this work showed that F1 CTX has a cytotoxic activity and pro-apoptotic potential, contributing to the knowledge about the F1 crotoxin properties as well as its possible use in cancer research, particularly in glioma and pancreatic cancer cell lines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: This randomized phase 2 trial compared the efficacy and safety of second-line nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) with or without the addition of CC-486 (an oral formulation of 5-azacytidine) in patients with advanced-stage, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: Patients were randomized to receive either nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2 on days 8 and 15 plus CC-486 200 mg daily on days 1 to 14 or single-agent nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8, with both regimens administered every 21 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints included the overall response rate, the disease control rate, and overall survival. Results: Between January 2015 and August 2016, 161 patients were randomized (81 to the combination arm and 80 to the single-agent nab-paclitaxel arm). There was no benefit from the addition of CC-486 to nab-paclitaxel. The median progression-free survival was 3.2 months for the combination and 4.2 months for single-agent nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-1.9). The median overall survival was 8.1 months in the combination arm and 17 months in the single-agent nab-paclitaxel arms (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.57). Grade 3 or greater treatment-related, emergent adverse events were reported by 40.5% of patients in the combination arm and by 31.6% of those in the single-agent nab-paclitaxel arm. Conclusions: Single-agent nab-paclitaxel was associated with promising outcomes and a tolerable safety profile as second-line treatment for patients with advanced-stage, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

    "Abstract": "Background: The identification of new therapeutic targets to improve health behaviors among cancer survivors (CS) is likely to improve cancer treatment outcomes. Delay discounting (DD) rate is the degree to which one devalues rewards as a function of time to receipt. Lower DD rates (ie, prioritizing long-term over immediate rewards) are associated with healthier behaviors. CS often experience distress and thoughts of early mortality that can potentially shift priorities to the present and negatively impact DD rates, especially when newly diagnosed. Understanding relations between DD and health behaviors among CS will contribute to the examination of DD as a therapeutic target for improving health behaviors for CS. Method: CS (n = 1001) were recruited from a web panel and administered a web-based questionnaire. Multivariate models examined relations among DD rate, years since diagnosis, and 10 health behavior indicators. We hypothesized that 1) higher DD rates would be associated with fewer years since diagnosis, and 2) lower DD rates would be associated with healthier behaviors, moderated by years since diagnosis. Results: In general, higher DD rates were associated with fewer years since diagnosis. Higher DD rates were associated with more alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, other tobacco use, tanning booth use, and conversely, greater adherence to annual primary care visits. A significant interaction between DD rate and years since diagnosis was not found. Conclusion: Lower DD rates are associated with several important healthy lifestyle behaviors. DD rate is a promising therapeutic target for new interventions to improve multiple health behaviors among CS. © 2018 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. Prevailing evidences suggest that drug resistance and recurrence of ovarian HGSC are caused by the presence of cancer stem cells. Therefore, targeting cancer stems is appealing, however, all attempts to date, have failed. To circumvent this limit, we analyzed differential transcriptomes at early differentiation of ovarian HGSC stem cells and identified the developmental transcription factor GATA3 as highly expressed in stem, compared to progenitor cells. GATA3 expression associates with poor prognosis of ovarian HGSC patients, and was found to recruit the histone H3, lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, UTX, activate stemness markers, and promote stem-like phenotypes in ovarian HGSC cell lines. Targeting UTX by its inhibitor, GSKJ4, impeded GATA3-driven stemness phenotypes, and enhanced apoptosis of GATA3-expressing cancer cells. Combinations of gemcitabine or paclitaxel with GSKJ4, resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect. Our findings provide evidence for a new role for GATA3 in ovarian HGSC stemness, and demonstrate that GATA3 may serve as a biomarker for precision epigenetic therapy in the future. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "The concept of stability is one of the commonly used physical phenomena. Current paper builds on the hypothesis that the optimal number of clusters present in the dataset corresponds to that partitioning which is most stable over some small changes in the dataset. In order to quantify the degree of stability, a new measure is also proposed in the paper. Thereafter an expert clustering approach is developed in the current paper which utilizes the properties of stability for automatically detecting the number of clusters from a given dataset. Initially, several different variants of the dataset are generated by introducing small perturbations. A multi-objective based expert clustering framework is developed to automatically partition different variants of the data. A new objective function, capturing stability property of clustering solution namely ‘Agreement-index’ along with two well-known objective functions are optimized simultaneously using a multi-objective simulated annealing based process, namely AMOSA for the purpose of clustering. Finally, the problem of cancer classification is addressed as the application domain of the proposed expert framework. Results of our newly developed stability based clustering namely Stab-clustering with respect to existing approaches are shown for twelve microarray cancer datasets in terms of different cluster quality measures. The obtained results confirm the robustness of our proposed technique over state-of-the-art. A thorough biological and statistical significance tests are also conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Targeted therapy changed the standard of care in ALK-dependent tumors. However, resistance remains a major challenge. Lorlatinib is a third-generation ALK inhibitor that inhibits most ALK mutants resistant to current ALK inhibitors. In this study, we utilize lorlatinib-resistant anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo to investigate the acquisition of resistance and its underlying mechanisms. ALCL cells acquired compound ALK mutations G1202R/G1269A and C1156F/L1198F in vitro at high drug concentrations. ALCL xenografts selected in vivo showed recurrent N1178H (5/10 mice) and G1269A (4/10 mice) mutations. Interestingly, intracellular localization of NPM/ALKN1178H skewed toward the cytoplasm in human cells, possibly mimicking overexpression. RNA sequencing of resistant cells showed significant alteration of PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways. Functional validation by small-molecule inhibitors confirmed the involvement of these pathways in resistance to lorlatinib. NSCLC cells exposed in vitro to lorlatinib acquired hyperactivation of EGFR, which was blocked by erlotinib to restore sensitivity to lorlatinib. In neuroblastoma, whole-exome sequencing and proteomic profiling of lorlatinib-resistant cells revealed a truncating NF1 mutation and hyperactivation of EGFR and ErbB4. These data provide an extensive characterization of resistance mechanisms that may arise in different ALK-positive cancers following lorlatinib treatment. Significance: High-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling reveals various mechanisms by which multiple tumor types acquire resistance to the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Immunotherapy has transformed the treatment of many solid tumors, with some patients deriving long-term benefit, but how to identify such patients remains unclear. Somatic mutations detected in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma can be an indicator of disease progression, response to therapy, and clonality of primary and metastatic lesions. Hence, ctDNA analysis can provide a valuable noninvasive and tumor-specific marker for longitudinal monitoring of tumor burden. We explored the use of ctDNA to predict survival on durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 therapy. Experimental Design: Variant allele frequencies (VAF) of somatic mutations in 73 genes were assessed in ctDNA using targeted sequencing in a discovery cohort consisting of 28 patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and two validation NSCLC and urothelial cancer (UC) cohorts of 72 and 29 patients, respectively, to correlate ctDNA changes with clinical outcomes. Results: Somatic variants were detected in 96% of patients. Changes in VAF preceded radiographic responses, and patients with reduction in VAF at 6 weeks had significantly greater reduction in tumor volume, with longer progression-free and overall survival. Conclusions: ctDNA VAF changes are strongly correlated with duration of treatment, antitumor activity, and clinical outcomes in NSCLC and UC. Early on-treatment reduction in ctDNA VAF may be a useful predictor of long-term benefit from immunotherapy. Prospective studies should validate these findings and the value of utilizing early changes in ctDNA for therapeutic decision making by identifying nonresponders to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapies and guiding combination therapies. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of change in policy of computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax in staging and follow-up of colorectal cancer (CRC). Another objective was to review the outcomes following pulmonary metastasectomies (Pmets) and to determine the prognostic factors affecting outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis from a prospective cohort database of patients, who underwent Pmet for CRC origin from August 2004 to February 2016. The outcome measures were number of Pmets per year, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and prognostic factors affecting survival. Results: Of 71 patients, 38% (n = 27) underwent Pmet before 2013 and 62% (n = 44) had surgery after 2013. The 2-year DFS after Pmet was 49.3% and estimated 5-year OS was 51.4% at a median follow-up of 28 months. There was a significant increase in number of Pmets/year (P = 0.0015), increased detection of synchronous pulmonary metastasis (PM) (P = 0.005), increased diagnosis of extra-pulmonary metastases (EPM) (P = 0.005), and improved OS (P = 0.026) after introduction of CT scan as staging tool. Site of primary tumor (colon) (P = 0.045), primary nodal stage (P = 0.009), and the presence of EPM (P = 0.01) were independent important prognostic factors affecting survival. Conclusion: The CT scan of thorax as a baseline tool for staging and follow-up in CRC increases referral for pulmonary metastasectomy. Surgery achieves excellent prognosis and long-term survival outcomes in CRC with isolated PM and carefully selected patients with solitary liver metastasis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Although the introduction of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-directed therapy including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancers (mBCs) favorably changed the natural history of this disease, most cases of HER2-positive mBC will eventually progress. Poziotinib is an oral pan-HER kinase inhibitor showing potent activity through irreversible inhibition of these kinases. This open-label, multicenter phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of poziotinib monotherapy in patients with HER2-positive mBC who had progressed from more than two HER2-directed therapies. Patients received 12 mg poziotinib once daily on a 14-day on/7-day off schedule. Progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint, the objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety were evaluated. From April 2015 to February 2016, 106 patients were enrolled in the trial from seven institutes in South Korea. They had a median age of 51 years (range 30–76) and had received a median of four prior therapies including two HER2-directed therapies for advanced or metastatic cancers. The median follow-up duration was 12 months. The median PFS was 4.04 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.94–4.40 months), and median overall survival has not been reached. The most common treatment-related adverse events were (total/grade ≥3) diarrhea (96.23%/14.15%), stomatitis (92.45%/12.26%) and rashes (63.21%/3.77%). Poziotinib showed meaningful activity in these heavily treated HER2-positive mBCs. Diarrhea and stomatitis were the major toxicities. Biomarker studies analyzed are warranted to support further evaluation of this treatment in such cases. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "2-Aryl 5-hydroxy benzo[d]oxazoles were designed as potential anticancer agents. A one-pot synthesis of these compounds dispenses the need for ortho-disubstituted precursor, aminophenol and proceeds via C–N formation as a key step followed by C–O cyclization to form benzo[d]oxazoles. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study was used to confirm the molecular structure of a representative compound unambiguously. All of these compounds were evaluated for their anti-proliferative properties in vitro against five cancer cell lines as well as noncancerous cells. Most of these compounds showed selective growth inhibition of cancer cells and few of them were found to be promising with IC 50 values in the range of 0.8–2.8 μM, comparable to the known anticancer drug doxorubicin. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Aging affects the core processes of almost every organism, and the functional decline at the cellular and tissue levels influences disease development. Recently, it was shown that the methylation of certain CpG dinucleotides correlates with chronological age and that this epigenetic clock can be applied to study aging-related effects. We investigated these molecular age loci in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues from patients with adenocarcinomas (AC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SQC) as well as in matched tumor-free lung tissue. In both NSCLC subtypes, the calculated epigenetic age did not correlate with the chronological age. In particular, SQC exhibited rejuvenation compared to the corresponding normal lung tissue as well as with the chronological age of the donor. Moreover, the younger epigenetic pattern was associated with a trend toward stem cell-like gene expression patterns. These findings show deep phenotypic differences between the tumor entities AC and SQC, which might be useful for novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Tumors of germline BRCA1/2 mutated carriers show homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRD), resulting in impaired DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and high sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Although this therapy is expected to be effective beyond germline BRCA1/2 mutated carriers, a robust validated test to detect HRD tumors is lacking. In this study, we therefore evaluated a functional HR assay exploiting the formation of RAD51 foci in proliferating cells after ex vivo irradiation of fresh breast cancer tissue: the recombination REpair CAPacity (RECAP) test. Experimental Design: Fresh samples of 170 primary breast cancer were analyzed using the RECAP test. The molecular explanation for the HRD phenotype was investigated by exploring BRCA deficiencies, mutational signatures, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Results: RECAP was completed successfully in 148 of 170 samples (87%). Twenty-four tumors showed HRD (16%), whereas six tumors were HR intermediate (HRi; 4%). HRD was explained by BRCA deficiencies (mutations, promoter hypermethylation, deletions) in 16 cases, whereas seven HRD tumors were non-BRCA related. HRD tumors showed an increased incidence of high TIL counts (P ¼ 0.023) compared with HR proficient (HRP) tumors and MSI was more frequently observed in the HRD group (2/20, 10%) than expected in breast cancer (1%; P ¼ 0.017). Conclusions: RECAP is a robust functional HR assay detecting both BRCA1/2-deficient and BRCA1/2-proficient HRD tumors. Functional assessment of HR in a pseudo-diagnostic setting is achievable and produces robust and interpretable results. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Additional surgery should be done after non-curative endoscopic resection (ER) in early gastric cancer (EGC) due to the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM). However, the distribution pattern of LNM in these patients is complicated and unpredictable. The aim of this study is to identify any different distribution patterns of LNM in patients with EGC who underwent additional surgery after non-curative (ER) comparing to those without ER. Methods: Patients who underwent surgery for EGC between 2001 and 2016 were included. Enrolled patients were divided into two groups, those who underwent additional surgery after non-curative ER and those who underwent direct surgery without a history of ER. Demographics, tumor characteristics and LNM distribution pattern were analyzed. Results: Among 4295 patients with EGC, 404 patients had a history of preoperative ER, and 3891 patients did not. After the application of exclusion criteria, 23 (7.1%) of 322 patients undergoing additional surgery had LNM. The additional surgery group showed less LNM, fewer nodal stations and more restricted distribution pattern of LNM. Conclusions: The distribution pattern of LNM in EGC is complicated. However, more restricted locoregional LNM could be expected in cases of additional surgery after non-curative ER than after direct surgery. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a natural flavonoid that exhibits anticancer properties in various carcinoma cell types. However, the precise mechanism responsible for its anticancer activity has not been elucidated fully. In the present study, we examined ISL-mediated apoptotic mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. ISL induced apoptosis in human HCT-116 cells and caused marked induction of p62/SQSTM1 mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, ISL potently inhibited in vivo tumor growth and induced p62/SQSTM1 expression in xenograft tumor tissues. In a p62/SQSTM1 siRNA transfection study, ISL-induced p62/SQSTM1 expression attenuated ISL-mediated apoptosis by reducing caspase-8 activation. ISL potentiated the apoptotic effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on HCT-116 cells. However, ISL-induced p62/SQSTM1 expression also attenuated the potency of apoptosis induced by the combination of 5-FU and ISL. Our results demonstrate that ISL-induced p62/SQSTM1 upregulation affects ISL-mediated apoptotic potential through attenuation of caspase-8 activation in CRC cells. These findings broaden the understanding of the molecular basis of ISL-mediated apoptosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor–stroma ratio (TSR) has previously been found to be a strong prognostic parameter in primary breast cancer tumors. Since the presence of tumor cells in lymph nodes is important for clinical decision making, the influence of TSR in the primary breast tumor combined with the TSR in tumor-positive lymph nodes on prognosis was evaluated. Women with invasive breast cancer without distant metastasis who underwent an axillary lymph node dissection between 1985 and 1994 at the Leiden University Medical Center were retrospectively analyzed. TSR assessment was performed on hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue slides. In total, 87 (45.5%) primary tumors were scored as stroma-low and 104 (54.5%) as stroma-high. Patients with a high stromal percentage in the primary tumors had a statistically significant worse relapse free period (RFP) compared to stroma-low tumors (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.37–2.82, p < 0.001). A total number of 915 lymph nodes were assessed for TSR. In 101 (52.9%) patients, heterogeneity was observed between stroma percentage category in primary tumor and lymph nodes. The combination of TSR of the primary tumor combined with TSR of tumor-positive lymph nodes strengthened each other as independent prognostic parameter for RFP (p = 0.019). Patients with primary tumor stroma-low/lymph nodes stroma-low tumors showed strongly improved RFP rates compared to patients with primary tumor stroma-high/lymph node stroma-high tumors with 10-year percentages of 58 versus 8%, respectively. Assessing the TSR on tumor-positive lymph nodes can provide additional prognostic information. Stromal activation strongly differs between primary tumors and lymph node metastasis. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Recently, several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to play crucial roles in tumorigenesis and progression of many cancers. Nevertheless, more than 50,000 lncRNAs were identified in human cells and the roles of majority of these lncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are unknown. In this study, using public NSCLC microarray data we identified a novel lncRNA BRE antisense RNA 1 (BRE-AS1). BRE-AS1 is significantly down-regulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays showed that BRE-AS1 reduces NSCLC cell viability, represses NSCLC cell proliferation, and induces NSCLC cell apoptosis in vitro, and represses NSCLC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigation revealed that BRE-AS1 physically binds STAT3, reduces the binding of STAT3 to the promoter of NR4A3, relieves the repression of NR4A3 caused by STAT3, and up-regulates NR4A3 expression. Consistently, NR4A3 is significantly down-regulated in NSCLC tissues and the expression of NR4A3 is positively correlated with the expression of BRE-AS1 in NSCLC tissues. In addition, depletion of NR4A3 attenuates the tumor suppressive roles of BRE-AS1 in NSCLC. Collectively, our data demonstrate that BRE-AS1 represses NSCLC cell growth and survival via up-regulating NR4A3 and suggest that enhancing BRE-AS1 may be potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Antrodia cinnamomea is a polyporaceous medicinal and native fungus in Taiwan. In this study, we found that AC-SPS-F3, a sulfated glucan from A. cinnamomea, reduced lung cancer cell viability via inhibition of EGFR and mTOR activity. The co-administration of AC-SPS-F3 and cisplatin synergistically inhibited lung cancer cell viability. We identified AC-SPS-F3 was a sulfated β-(1→4)-D-glucan with two long 1,6-branches in each repeat unit. The FT-IR absorption at 1341 cm–1 and 887 cm–1 confirmed the existence of sulfates. The proposed repeat unit of AC-SPS-F3, including the types of main skeleton and side chains, as well as the position of the minor galactopyranosyl and mannopyranosyl residues, were proposed according to the 1D and 2D NMR spectra, shown as follows: The features for the proposed repeat unit of AC-SPS-F3 included two long β-(1→6)-Glcp branches, a very high ratio of sulfate substitution, and partial 2-O and 4-O substituents evenly distributed on the β-(1→6)-Glcp branches. The present study is first to characterize the highly branched sulfated polysaccharides and elucidates its anti-cancer functions. [Figure presented] © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Murine tumor models have played a fundamental role in the development of novel therapeutic interventions and are currently widely used in translational research. Specifically, strategies that aim at reducing inter-animal variability of tumor size in transplantable mouse tumor models are of particular importance. In our approach, we used magnetic nanoparticles to label and manipulate colon cancer cells for the improvement of the standard syngeneic subcutaneous mouse tumor model. Following subcutaneous injection on the scruff of the neck, magnetically-tagged implanted cancer cells were manipulated by applying an external magnetic field towards localized tumor formation. Our data provide evidence that this approach can facilitate the formation of localized tumors of similar shape, reducing thereby the tumor size’s variability. For validating the proof-of-principle, a low-dose of 5-FU was administered in small animal groups as a representative anticancer therapy. Under these experimental conditions, the 5-FU-induced tumor growth inhibition was statistically significant only after the implementation of the proposed method. The presented approach is a promising strategy for studying accurately therapeutic interventions in subcutaneous experimental solid tumor models allowing for the detection of statistically significant differences between smaller experimental groups. © 2018, Biomedical Engineering Society.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Chemotherapeutic resistance eventually develops in all patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Gene silencing through promoter demethylation is one potential reversible mechanism of resistance with administration of hypomethylating agents. We evaluated the safety and tolerability of guadecitabine and irinotecan in patients with mCRC previously treated with irinotecan. Patients and Methods: In this 3þ3 dose-escalation study, patients with mCRC previously exposed to irinotecan received guadecitabine days 1 to 5 of a 28-day cycle and irinotecan 125 mg/m 2 days 8 and 15 [dose level (DL) 1, guadecitabine 45 mg/m 2 ; DL 1: guadecitabine 30 mg/m 2 ; DL 1G: guadecitabine 30 mg/m 2 with growth factor support (GFS); DL 1G: guadecitabine 45 mg/m 2 with GFS]. Results: Twenty-two patients were treated across four DLs. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenic fever (DL 1 and 1G), biliary drain infection (DL 1), colonic obstruction (DL 1), and severe dehydration (DL 1G). Most common toxicities were neutropenia (82% any grade, 77% Grade 3/4), neutropenic fever (23%), leukopenia (73% any grade, 50% Grade 3/4), and injection site reactions (64% total, 0% Grade 3/4). Patients received a median of 4.5 cycles of treatment; 12/17 evaluable patients had stable disease as best response, with one having initial disease progression but subsequently durable partial response. Circulating tumor DNA showed decrease in global demethylation by LINE-1 after treatment. Conclusions: We report the first study of chemo-priming with epigenetic therapy in gastrointestinal cancers. Guadecitabine 45 mg/m 2 and irinotecan 125 mg/m 2 with GFS was safe and tolerable in patients with mCRC, with early indication of benefit. These data have provided the basis for an ongoing phase II randomized, multicenter trial. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Elevation of L-2-hydroxylgutarate (L-2-HG) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is due in part to reduced expression of L-2-HG dehydrogenase (L2HGDH). However, the contribution of L-2-HG to renal carcinogenesis and insight into the biochemistry and targets of this small molecule remains to be elucidated. Experimental Design: Genetic and pharmacologic approaches to modulate L-2-HG levels were assessed for effects on in vitro and in vivo phenotypes. Metabolomics was used to dissect the biochemical mechanisms that promote L-2-HG accumulation in RCC cells. Transcriptomic analysis was utilized to identify relevant targets of L-2-HG. Finally, bioinformatic and metabolomic analyses were used to assess the L-2-HG/L2HGDH axis as a function of patient outcome and cancer progression. Results: L2HGDH suppresses both in vitro cell migration and in vivo tumor growth and these effects are mediated by L2HGDH's catalytic activity. Biochemical studies indicate that glutamine is the predominant carbon source for L-2-HG via the activity of malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2). Inhibition of the glutamine-MDH2 axis suppresses in vitro phenotypes in an L-2-HG–dependent manner. Moreover, in vivo growth of RCC cells with basal elevation of L-2-HG is suppressed by glutaminase inhibition. Transcriptomic and functional analyses demonstrate that the histone demethylase KDM6A is a target of L-2-HG in RCC. Finally, increased L-2-HG levels, L2HGDH copy loss, and lower L2HGDH expression are associated with tumor progression and/or worsened prognosis in patients with RCC. Conclusions: Collectively, our studies provide biochemical and mechanistic insight into the biology of this small molecule and provide new opportunities for treating L-2-HG–driven kidney cancers. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Almost all patients with EGFR-driven lung cancer who are treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) develop resistance to treatment. A single base (c.2369C>T) transition mutation, EGFR T790M, is the most frequent resistance event after first-generation exposure to EGFR TKIs. Whether T790M mutation is acquired or is selected from a preexisting clone has been a matter of significant debate. In this study, we show that treatment with EGFR TKIs leads to activation of the NFkB pathway, which in turn induces expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA). In turn, AICDA causes deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine at position c.2369 to generate the T790M mutation. Pharmacologic inhibition of the NFkB pathway or knockout of AICDA decreased the frequency or prevented the development of T790M mutation, respectively. In addition, patients treated with first-line EGFR TKI displayed increased expression of AICDA and detection of the T790M mutation upon progression. These results identify the mechanism of T790M acquisition and present an opportunity to target the process to delay or prevent it. Significance: These findings identify the mechanism behind acquisition of a common resistance mutation to TKI treatment in lung cancer. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA (miR) is important regulators of gene expression, and aberrant miR expression has been linked to oncogenesis; however, little is understood about their contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we determined that miR-23a is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer cell lines and tissues compared with that of normal cells. The stable over-expression of miR-23a in CRC cells was sufficient to promote cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Further studies showed that miR-23a can directly bind to the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) of PDK4 mRNA and subsequently repress both the mRNA and protein expressions of PDK4. PDK4 negatively regulate CRC proliferation via suppressing PDH activity. Ectopic expression of PDK4 by transiently transfected with PDK4 vector encoding the entire coding sequence could reverse the effects of miR-23a on CRC proliferation. By this way, miR-23a promotes PDH activation and oxidative phosphorylation to generate sufficient ATP for cell proliferation. Our results illustrated that the up-regulation of miR-23a played an important role in CRC cell proliferation through direct repressing PDK4, suggesting a potential application of miR-23a in prognosis prediction and therapeutic application in CRC. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Osimertinib has been approved as a first-line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumor carries EGFR activation and / or resistant mutations. To mitigate Osimertinib's toxicity caused by AZ5104, the N-demethylation metabolite of Osimertinib, we designed and synthesized a series of Osimertinib analogs with different headpieces. In vitro and in vivo analysis rendered a potential clinical candidate C-005 which had pyrrolo-pyridine headpiece. Biochemically, C-005 and its main human hepatocyte metabolite showed over 30 fold selectivity of L858R/T790M mutant EGFR over WT EGFR. Such selectivity profile was retained at cellular level. In general, C-005 is 2-14 fold more selective than Osimertinib in a panel of WT EGFR cancer cell lines. Furthermore, C-005 demonstrated robust antitumor efficacy and good tolerability in NCI-H1975, PC-9 and HCC827 xenograft mouse models, making it a potential candidate for human test in clinical. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate the trajectory of hospitalization costs, and to assess the determinants related to the membership of the identified trajectories, with the view of recommending future research directions. A retrospective study was performed in urban Yichang, China, where a total of 134 end-stage lung cancer patients were selected. The latent class analysis (LCA) model was used to investigate the heterogeneity in the trajectory of hospitalization cost amongst the different groups that were identified. A multi-nominal logit model was applied to explore the attributes of different classes. Three classes were defined as follows: Class 1 represented the trajectory with minimal cost, which had increased over the last two months. Classes 2 and 3 consisted of patients that incurred high costs, which had declined with the impending death of the patient. Patients in class 3 had a higher average cost than those in Class 2. The level of education, hospitalization, and place of death, were the attributes of membership to the different classes. LCA was useful in quantifying heterogeneity amongst the patients. The results showed the attributes were embedded in hospitalization cost trajectories. These findings are applicable to early identification and intervention in palliative care. Future studies should focus on the validation of the proposed model in clinical settings, as well as to identify the determinants of early discharge or aggressive care. © 2018 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "TRIM29 (tripartite motif-containing protein 29) is a TRIM family protein that has been implicated in breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. However, its role in stratified squamous epithelial cells and tumors has not been elucidated. Here, we investigate the expression of TRIM29 in cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and its functions in the tumorigenesis of such cancers. TRIM29 expression was lower in malignant SCC lesions than in adjacent normal epithelial tissue or benign tumors. Lower expression of TRIM29 was associated with higher SCC invasiveness. Primary tumors of cutaneous SCC showed aberrant hypermethylation of TRIM29. Depletion of TRIM29 increased cancer cell migration and invasion; conversely, overexpression of TRIM29 suppressed these. Comprehensive proteomics and immunoprecipitation analyses identified keratins and keratin-interacting protein FAM83H as TRIM29 interactors. Knockdown of TRIM29 led to ectopic keratin localization of keratinocytes. In primary tumors, lower TRIM29 expression correlated with the altered expression of keratins. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for TRIM29 in regulating the distribution of keratins, as well as in the migration and invasion of SCC. They also suggest that the TRIM29–keratin axis could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in stratified epithelial tumors and may provide a target for SCC therapeutics. Significance: These findings identify TRIM29 as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker in stratified epithelial tissues. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: EGFR exon 20 insertions account for up to 10% of all EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinomas, representing the third most common cluster of mutations. The management of advanced cancers with these mutations remains elusive, without an approved inhibitor. Experimental Design: Preclinical models of a representative set of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations to evaluate the efficacy of different inhibitors and description of the clinical outcome of an advanced lung cancer. Results: We show that select first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR inhibitors are unable to deter common EGFR exon 20 insertion mutants in concentrations that spare the wild-type kinase. Nonetheless, EGFR exon 20 insertion mutants associate with the Hsp90 chaperone system. We exploit this vulnerability to show that the nongeldanamycin Hsp90 inhibitor luminespib (formerly AUY922) degrades EGFR exon 20 mutations, downstream targets, and induces apoptosis. In addition, a patient whose EGFR inhibitor–insensitive lung adenocarcinoma harbored an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation had a confirmed radiographic response to luminespib. Conclusions: The report confirms that EGFR exon 20 mutations are dependent on Hsp90 and are readily inhibited by the Hsp90 inhibitor luminespib; a treatment strategy that has been pursued in a confirmatory clinical trial (NCT01854034) for this group of lung adenocarcinomas that currently represent an unmet clinical need in precision oncology. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: We investigated the operative outcomes of thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TE) in the prone position, using the concept of total meso-esophageal excision for esophageal cancer. Methods: The medical records of 140 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who underwent radical esophagectomy by TE were reviewed retrospectively, and operative outcomes were compared between patients treated before (non-meso-esophagus; non-ME group) and after (ME group) the introduction of total meso-esophageal excision (ME). Results: There were no significant differences between the groups in postoperative morbidity (non-ME group vs. ME group, 28.3% vs. 41.4%, p = 0.119), 30-day mortality (non-ME group vs. ME group, 0% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.433), and in-hospital mortality (non-ME group vs. ME group, 1.9% vs. 0%, p = 0.199). Although overall survival and relapse-free survival did not differ significantly between the groups, the overall recurrence rate was significantly lower in the ME group than the non-ME group (non-ME group vs. ME group, 43.4% vs. 23%, p = 0.011). In particular, the rate of regional lymph node recurrence in the mediastinum was lower in the ME group (non-ME group vs. ME group, 11.3% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.026). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the ME procedure might be one of the procedures that reduce regional lymph node recurrence in the mediastinum without any deterioration in short-term outcomes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Chinese Americans are one of the fastest-growing and largest Asian-American subgroups. Approximately 70% of Chinese Americans are immigrants with 46% being of limited English proficiency. Despite colorectal cancer (CRC) being the second leading cause of cancer death in Chinese Americans, Chinese Americans have lower CRC screening rates than other Asian subgroups, and only 40% of CRC cases among Chinese Americans are diagnosed early. Furthermore, CRC is the second most common cancer among Chinese American women. Race/ethnicity concordant providers may process culturally specific knowledge, skills, and experience that may facilitate better communication. Although using an interpreter can help to overcome language barriers between providers and patients, it may not achieve the same level of communication as a language concordant provider. The purpose of this study was to test a community education intervention, taking into account the racial/ethnic and language concordance of the presenter, to increase CRC screening uptake among foreign-born Chinese American women. This study used a quasi-experimental design and a convenience sample of 198 foreign-born Chinese-American women. Logistic regression was used to examine the effect of racial/ethnic and language concordance of the presenter on the return of completed FOBT kits for testing. The Chinese/English-speaking presenter had the highest return rate (73%), followed by the White/English-speaking presenter (61%), and the Chinese/Chinese-speaking presenter (48%), and the differences were statistically significant. Post-education intention to screen was also a significant predictor for returning the FOBT kit for testing. The use of an interpreter did not decrease the effectiveness of the educational intervention. © 2018, W. Montague Cobb-NMA Health Institute.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Diet and healthy weight are established means of reducing cancer incidence and mortality. However, the impact of diet modifications on the tumor microenvironment and antitumor immunity is not well defined. Immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are associated with poor clinical outcomes and are potentially modifiable through dietary interventions. We tested the hypothesis that dietary protein restriction modifies macrophage function toward antitumor phenotypes. Experimental Design: Macrophage functional status under different tissue culture conditions and in vivo was assessed by Western blot, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and cytokine array analyses. Tumor growth in the context of protein or amino acid (AA) restriction and immunotherapy, namely, a survivin peptide–based vaccine or a PD-1 inhibitor, was examined in animal models of prostate (RP-B6Myc) and renal (RENCA) cell carcinoma. All tests were two-sided. Results: Protein or AA-restricted macrophages exhibited enhanced tumoricidal, proinflammatory phenotypes, and in two syngeneic tumor models, protein or AA-restricted diets elicited reduced TAM infiltration, tumor growth, and increased response to immunotherapies. Further, we identified a distinct molecular mechanism by which AA-restriction reprograms macrophage function via a ROS/mTOR-centric cascade. Conclusions: Dietary protein restriction alters TAM activity and enhances the tumoricidal capacity of this critical innate immune cell type, providing the rationale for clinical testing of this supportive tool in patients receiving cancer immunotherapies. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Lauren diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinomas (DGAs) are generally genomically stable. We identified lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) as a frequently mutated gene and examined its role in DGA progression. Experimental Design: We performed whole exome sequencing on tumor samples of 27 patients with DGA who underwent gastrectomy. Lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) was analyzed in DGA cell lines and in patient tumors. Results: KMT2C was the most frequently mutated gene (11 of 27 tumors [41%]). KMT2C expression by immunohistochemistry in tumors from 135 patients with DGA undergoing gastrectomy inversely correlated with more advanced tumor stage (P ¼ 0.023) and worse overall survival (P ¼ 0.017). KMT2C shRNA knockdown in nontransformed HFE-145 gastric epithelial cells promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as demonstrated by increased expression of EMT-related proteins N-cadherin and Slug. Migration and invasion in gastric epithelial cells following KMT2C knockdown increased by 47- to 88-fold. In the DGA cell lines MKN-45 and SNU-668, which have lost KMT2C expression, KMT2C re-expression decreased expression of EMT-related proteins, reduced cell migration by 52% to 60%, and reduced cell invasion by 50% to 74%. Flank xenografts derived from KMT2C-expressing DGA organoids, compared with wild-type organoids, grew more slowly and lost their infiltrative leading edge. EMT can lead to the acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotypes. KMT2C re-expression in DGA cell lines reduced spheroid formation by 77% to 78% and reversed CSC resistance to chemotherapy via promotion of DNA damage and apoptosis. Conclusions: KMT2C is frequently mutated in certain populations with DGA. KMT2C loss in DGA promotes EMT and is associated with worse overall survival. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

Here, we sought to identify HGSOC-specific alterations in DNA methylation and assess their potential to provide sensitive and specific detection of HGSOC at its earliest stages. Experimental Design: MethylationEPIC genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on a discovery cohort comprising 23 HGSOC, 37 non-HGSOC malignant, and 36 histologically unremarkable gynecologic tissue samples. The resulting data were processed using selective bioinformatic criteria to identify regions of high-confidence HGSOC-specific differential methylation. Quantitative methylation-specific real-time PCR (qMSP) assays were then developed for 8 of the top-performing regions and analytically validated in a cohort of 90 tissue samples. Lastly, qMSP assays were used to assess and compare methylation in 30 laser-capture microdissected (LCM) fallopian tube epithelia samples obtained from cancer-free and serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) positive women. Results: Bioinformatic selection identified 91 regions of robust, HGSOC-specific hypermethylation, 23 of which exhibited an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) value 0.9 in the discovery cohort. Seven of 8 top-performing regions demonstrated AUC values between 0.838 and 0.968 when analytically validated by qMSP in a 90-patient cohort. A panel of the 3 top-performing genes (c17orf64, IRX2, and TUBB6) was able to perfectly discriminate HGSOC (AUC 1.0). Hypermethylation within these loci was found exclusively in LCM fallopian tube epithelia from women with STIC lesions, but not in cancer-free fallopian tubes. Conclusions: A panel of methylation biomarkers can be used to accurately identify HGSOC, even at precursor stages of the disease. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC), which is one of the most lethal of malignancies and a major health burden, is associated with a dismal prognosis despite current therapeutic advances. Numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have shown to be essential for PC tumorigenesis and progression. Nevertheless, the exact expression pattern of lnc-PCTST and its clinical significance still remain unclear. This study investigates the expression pattern of lnc-PCTST and its associated mRNA in three paired PC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues by Microarray-coarray approach. Briefly, our data demonstrated that lnc-PCTST expression is down-regulated in PC tissues. Also, lnc-PCTST has shown to be negatively correlated with transforming acidic coiled-coil 3 (TACC-3) expression. This expression pattern was further confirmed following qRT-PCR validation of 34 out of 48 paired cancer tissues. Furthermore, lnc-PCTST overexpression in PC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and tumorigenesis in vivo (using nude mice as animal model), but did not altered cell migration. Moreover, lnc-PCTST overexpression increased E-cadherin and repressed vimentin expression in vitro. Additionally, TACC-3 knockdown simulated the inhibiting effect of lnc-PCTST overexpression on PC cell lines, and the impaired proliferation, invasion effect and E-cadherin, vimentin expression on lnc-PCTST over-expressed cell lines can be rescued by overexpressed TACC-3. Significantly, the expression of lnc-PCTST was closely associated with its genomic neighboring gene TACC-3 and inhibited its promoter activity. In conclusion, lnc-PCTST is a potential tumor suppressor in PC, which inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, tumorigenesis and EMT by modulating TACC-3. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Background: The incidence of occult metastatic disease (OMD) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and associated risk factors are largely unknown. Methods: We identified all patients with PDAC, who had an aborted oncologic operation due to OMD within a 10-year period. The cases were matched to a cohort of resected PDAC patients on a 1:3 ratio, based on age and sex, for comparison of preoperative clinical characteristics and potential risk factors for OMD. Results: In the studied period, 117 patients with OMD were identified in 1423 pancreatectomies performed for PDAC (8%). Liver metastases were the most common finding (79%) followed by peritoneal implants (16%). When compared with non-OMD cases, patients with OMD presented more often with abdominal pain (P < 0.001), and higher preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) values (P = 0.007). Additionally, indeterminate liver lesions on preoperative computed tomography (CT) were identified in 40% of OMD versus 17% of non-OMD patients (P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis distinguished four independent predictors for OMD: indeterminate lesions on preoperative CT, tumor size > 30 mm, abdominal pain, and preoperative CA 19-9 > 192 U/mL. Conclusions: Occurrence of OMD in PDAC accounts for 8% of cases. Preoperative CA 19-9 > 192 U/mL, primary tumor size > 30 mm, and identification of indeterminate lesions in preoperative CT may indicate the need for diagnostic laparoscopy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In North America and Europe, return-to-work (RTW) rates vary among breast cancer (BC) survivors, from 24% to 66% and from 53% to 82% at 6 and 36 months after diagnosis, respectively. To date, there is a lack of data on RTW rates after BC diagnosis in Latin America. Therefore, the primary objectives of this study were to define RTW rates at 12 and 24 months after BC diagnosis and to identify the factors associated with RTW in this population. Methods: In total, 125 employed women from a single institution with newly diagnosed BC were interviewed by telephone at 6, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis. Those who had inoperable or metastatic disease were excluded. Results: Overall, RTW rates were 30.3% and 60.4% at 12 and 24 months after BC diagnosis, respectively. Most women reported that they received support from their employer, but only 29.1% reported having been offered work adjustments. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with positive RTW outcomes included higher household income (odds ratio [OR], 17.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.33-94.75; P =.001), breast-conserving surgery (OR, 9.77; 95% CI, 2.03-47.05; P =.004), and work adjustments (OR, 37.62; 95% CI, 2.03-47.05; P =.004). The factors associated with negative RTW outcomes included adjuvant endocrine therapy (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.74; P =.023), and depression diagnosed after BC (OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.63; P =.017). Conclusions: RTW rates in the current study were lower than those observed in developed countries but similar to the rates among low-income Americans. Workplace adjustments, higher income, breast-conserving surgery, endocrine therapy, and depression after BC played an important role in the RTW decision. © 2018 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "The tumor–stroma ratio (TSR) reflected on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histological images is a potential prognostic factor for survival. Automatic image processing techniques that allow for high-throughput and precise discrimination of tumor epithelium and stroma are required to elevate the prognostic significance of the TSR. As a variant of deep learning techniques, transfer learning leverages nature-images features learned by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to relieve the requirement of deep CNNs for immense sample size when handling biomedical classification problems. Herein we studied different transfer learning strategies for accurately distinguishing epithelial and stromal regions of H&E-stained histological images acquired from either breast or ovarian cancer tissue. We compared the performance of important deep CNNs as either a feature extractor or as an architecture for fine-tuning with target images. Moreover, we addressed the current contradictory issue about whether the higher-level features would generalize worse than lower-level ones because they are more specific to the source-image domain. Under our experimental setting, the transfer learning approach achieved an accuracy of 90.2 (vs. 91.1 for fine tuning) with GoogLeNet, suggesting the feasibility of using it in assisting pathology-based binary classification problems. Our results also show that the superiority of the lower-level or the higher-level features over the other ones was determined by the architecture of deep CNNs. © 2018, Biomedical Engineering Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus is strongly related to the risk of pancreatic cancer in pregnant women, but gestational diabetes can precede a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer by many years. Women with a history of gestational diabetes showed a relative risk of pancreatic cancer of 7.1. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most common malignancies associated with thromboembolic events. A clinical study showed that thromboembolic events were detected in 36% of patients diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer. Studies showed that gestational diabetes mellitus could be one of the important risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Case presentation: Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risk of breast and pancreatic cancer. This case report describes a 29-year-old Chinese woman who presented with: gestational diabetes mellitus; International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria suggested disseminated intravascular coagulation with a score of 5; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count syndrome; and pulmonary hypertension. After an intravenous injection of fibrinogen, she gave birth to a normal baby and following delivery, her blood pressure reached 180/110 mmHg. Laboratory analysis results showed elevated lactic dehydrogenase, decreased platelets and fibrinogen, and urine protein was positive. She was transfused with fresh frozen plasma, blood coagulation factor, and fibrinogen. Subsequently, she was transferred to a maternity intensive care unit, where magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis was continued for 24 hours to keep her magnesium level at a low therapeutic range. However, continuous oxygen therapy was needed to maintain her oxygenation. Further laboratory investigations revealed elevated carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and carbohydrate antigen 72-4. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed malignant carcinoma in the head of her pancreas with lymph node involvement along with bone, peritoneal, and left adrenal metastasis, as well as double lung lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Conclusion: A differential diagnosis of digestive system neoplasm should be considered when a pregnant patient presents with gestational diabetes mellitus and disseminated intravascular coagulation, where the disseminated intravascular coagulation has no specific cause and cannot be readily resolved. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is due to an aggressive phenotype and lack of biomarker-driven targeted therapies. Overexpression of cyclin E and phosphorylated-CDK2 are correlated with poor survival in patients with TNBC, and the absence of CDK2 desensitizes cells to inhibition of Wee1 kinase, a key cell-cycle regulator. We hypothesize that cyclin E expression can predict response to therapies, which include the Wee1 kinase inhibitor, AZD1775. Experimental Design: Mono- and combination therapies with AZD1775 were evaluated in TNBC cell lines and multiple patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with different cyclin E expression profiles. The mechanism(s) of cyclin E–mediated replicative stress were investigated following cyclin E induction or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout by a number of assays in multiple cell lines. Results: Cyclin E overexpression (i) is enriched in TNBCs with high recurrence rates, (ii) sensitizes TNBC cell lines and PDX models to AZD1775, (iii) leads to CDK2-dependent activation of DNA replication stress pathways, and (iv) increases Wee1 kinase activity. Moreover, treatment of cells with either CDK2 inhibitors or carboplatin leads to transient transcriptional induction of cyclin E (in cyclin E–low tumors) and result in DNA replicative stress. Such drug-mediated cyclin E induction in TNBC cells and PDX models sensitizes them to AZD1775 in a sequential treatment combination strategy. Conclusions: Cyclin E is a potential biomarker of response (i) for AZD1775 as monotherapy in cyclin E–high TNBC tumors and (ii) for sequential combination therapy with CDK2 inhibitor or carboplatin followed by AZD1775 in cyclin E–low TNBC tumors. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that activates oncogenic transformation in several solid tumors, including lung and breast cancers. Ganetespib, a most promising candidate among several HSP90 inhibitors under clinical trials, has entered Phase III clinical trials for cancer therapy. Despite numerous evidences validating HSP90 as a target of anticancer, there are few studies on PET agents targeting oncogenic HSP90. In this study, we synthesized and biologically evaluated a novel 18F-labeled 5-resorcinolic triazolone derivative (1, [18F]PTP-Ganetespib) based on ganetespib. [18F]PTP-Ganetespib was labeled by click chemistry of Ganetespib-PEG-Alkyne (10) and [18F]PEG-N3 (11) with 37.3 ± 5.11% of radiochemical yield and 99.7 ± 0.09% of radiochemical purity. [18F]PTP-Ganetespib showed proper LogP (0.96 ± 0.06) and good stability in human serum over 97% for 2 h. [18F]PTP-Ganetespib showed high uptakes in breast cancer cells containing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 and Her2-negative MCF-7 cells, which are target breast cancer cell lines of HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib, as an anticancer. Blocking of HSP90 by the pretreatment of ganetespib exhibited significantly decreased accumulation of [18F]PTP-Ganetespib in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, indicating the specific binding of [18F]PTP-Ganetespib to MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with high HSP90 expression. In the biodistribution and microPET imaging studies, the initial uptake into tumor was weaker than in other thoracic and abdominal organs, but [18F]PTP-Ganetespib was retained relatively longer in the tumor than other organs. The uptake of [18F]PTP-Ganetespib in tumors was not sufficient for further development as a tumor-specific PET imaging agent by itself, but this preliminary PET imaging study of [18F]PTP-Ganetespib can be basis for developing new PET imaging agents based on HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Novel approaches toward understanding the evolution of disease can lead to the discovery of biomarkers that will enable better management of disease progression and improve prognostic evaluation. Raman spectroscopy is a promising investigative and diagnostic tool that can assist in uncovering the molecular basis of disease and provide objective, quantifiable molecular information for diagnosis and treatment evaluation. This technique probes molecular vibrations/rotations associated with chemical bonds in a sample to obtain information on molecular structure, composition, and intermolecular interactions. Raman scattering occurs when light interacts with a molecular vibration/rotation and a change in polarizability takes place during molecular motion. This results in light being scattered at an optical frequency shifted (up or down) from the incident light. By monitoring the intensity profile of the inelastically scattered light as a function of frequency, the unique spectroscopic fingerprint of a tissue sample is obtained. Since each sample has a unique composition, the spectroscopic profile arising from Raman-active functional groups of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates allows for the evaluation, characterization, and discrimination of tissue type. This review provides an overview of the theory of Raman spectroscopy, instrumentation used for measurement, and variation of Raman spectroscopic techniques for clinical applications in cancer, including detection of brain, ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers and circulating tumor cells. © 2018, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Although PTHrP is implicated in several cancers, its role in chemoresistance is not fully elucidated. We found that in CRC cells, PTHrP exerts proliferative and protective effects and induces cell migration. The aim of this work was to further study the effects of PTHrP in CRC cells. Herein we evidenced, for the first time, that PTHrP induces resistance to CPT-11 in Caco-2 and HCT116 cells; although both cell lines responded to the drug through different molecular mechanisms, the chemoresistance by PTHrP in these models is mediated through ERK, which in turn is activated by PCK, Src and Akt. Moreover, continue administration of PTHrP in nude mice xenografts increased the protein levels of this MAPK and of other markers related to tumorigenic events. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to ERK 1/2 activation and the study of ERK targets may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for CRC treatment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Gliomas, a genetically heterogeneous group of primary central nervous system tumors, continue to pose a significant clinical challenge. Discovery of chromosomal rearrangements involving kinase genes has enabled precision therapy, and improved outcomes in several malignancies. Experimental Design: Positing that similar benefit could be accomplished for patients with brain cancer, we evaluated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma dataset. Functional validation of the oncogenic potential and inhibitory sensitivity of discovered ROS1 fusions was performed using three independent cell-based model systems, and an in vivo murine xenograft study. Results: In silico analysis revealed previously unreported intrachromosomal 6q22 microdeletions that generate ROS1-fusions from TCGA glioblastoma dataset. ROS1 fusions in primary glioma and ependymoma were independently corroborated from MSK-IMPACT and Foundation Medicine clinical datasets. GOPC–ROS1 is a recurrent ROS1 fusion in primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. CEP85L–ROS1 and GOPC–ROS1 are transforming oncogenes in cells of astrocytic lineage, and amenable to phar-macologic inhibition with several ROS1 inhibitors even when occurring concurrently with other cancer hotspot aberrations frequently associated with glioblastoma. Oral monotherapy with a brain-permeable ROS1 inhibitor, lorlatinib, significantly prolonged survival in an intracranially xenografted tumor model generated from a ROS1 fusion-positive glioblastoma cell line. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that CNS tumors should be specifically interrogated for these rare intrachromosomal 6q22 microdeletion events that generate actionable ROS1 fusions. ROS1 fusions in primary brain cancer may be amenable for clinical intervention with kinase inhibitors, and this holds the potential of novel treatment paradigms in these treatment-refractory cancer types, particularly in glioblastoma. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Routine brain MRI surveillance frequently diagnoses small, asymptomatic brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that are effectively treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). A subset of patients, however, may die prior to the onset of symptoms. This study identifies clinical features that distinguish neurologically-asymptomatic NSCLC brain metastases patients that die prior to routine 3 month follow-up after SRS. Methods: Retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2017 identified 18 patients with neurologically-asymptomatic NSCLC brain metastases who died < 3 months after SRS. Twenty-eight additional patients meeting criteria and surviving > 6 months after SRS were identified. Clinical factors were examined to determine characteristics correlated with survival using cox proportional hazards and nominal logistic regression models. Logistic regression models using salient factors were trained with 10-fold cross-validation and compared to the graded prognostic assessment (GPA) and score index of radiosurgery (SIR) using the AUC from receiver operant characteristic curves. Results: The median survival following SRS was 1.4 and 9.2 months for the < 3 months and > 6 months groups, respectively. Age, number of brain metastases, and Karnofsky performance status were associated with overall survival while gender and interval between primary cancer and first brain metastasis diagnoses were associated with < 3 months and > 6 months survival, respectively. Models using GPA and SIR performed poorly compared to preliminary metrics generated in this study for prognosis of both < 3 months and > 6 months survival. Conclusion: Physicians require data to provide high-value, cost-conscious health care. Clinical metrics can screen patients with asymptomatic NSCLC brain metastases likely to die prior to the standard screening interval and observation could be considered. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Twinfilin-1 (TWF1) has been implicated in cell motility, invasion and migration. However, its exact role in lung cancer progression is still unclear. In the present study, we explored clinical and prognostic relevance of Twinfilin-1 (TWF1) levels for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Main methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was analyzed for possible association between TWF1 expressions in NSCLC tissues and patient prognosis. The meta-analysis data was validated in our clinical study through techniques of immunoblotting, expression analysis and immunohistochemistry. Key findings: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) as well as lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) showed significantly elevated expression of TWF1 compared to normal lung tissues. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed high expression of TWF1 to be independent prognostic indicator involved in overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.636; 95% CI: 1.223–2.189) and recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.551; 95% CI: 1.158–2.077) in LUAD, but not in LUSC. Similar trend was found in our clinical study. LUAD tissues reflected TWF1 overexpression to be positively correlated with grade of tumor, size and lymph node metastasis. Enhanced TWF1 expression was identified to be an independent predictor for the disadvantageous prognosis of LUAD through simultaneously both univariate as well as multivariate Cox regression analyses (both p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival graphs further corroborated that poor disease prediction in the patients with LUAD was indicated through high TWF1 expression (p = 0.028). Significance: Robustness and poor prognosis in LUAD correlated with TWF1 levels thus making it a suitable therapeutic target against LUAD. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Although renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most malignant urologic cancer, its pathogenesis remains unclear, and effective treatments for advanced RCC are still lacking. Here, we report that a novel E2F1–miR-520/372/373–SPOP axis controls RCC carcinogenesis. Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) was upregulated in over 90% of RCC tissues, whereas the miR-520/372/ 373 family was downregulated and correlated inversely with SPOP protein levels in RCC tissues. The miR-520/372/373 family targeted the SPOP 3 0 -UTR and suppressed SPOP protein expression, leading to elevation of PTEN and DUSP7 levels and, consequently, decreased proliferation, invasion/ migration, and metastasis of RCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Tail-vein delivery of therapeutic miR-520/372/373 family significantly decreased both tumor size and lung metastasis ratio in mice bearing orthotopic xenograft tumors. Decreased expression of miR-520/372/373 family was mediated by transcription factor E2F1. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the E2F1-miR-520/372/373–SPOP axis functions as a key signaling pathway in RCC progression and metastasis and represents a promising opportunity for targeted therapies. Significance: These findings show that the E2F1-miR-520/ 372/373 family–SPOP axis promotes RCC progression, thereby contributing to our understanding of RCC pathogenesis and unveiling new avenues for more effective targeted therapies. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a common cancer worldwide, is etiologically associated with tobacco use, high alcohol consumption, and high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV). The Notch signaling pathway, which is involved in cell differentiation decisions with differential downstream targets and effects depending on tissue type and developmental stage, has been implicated in human HNSCC. NOTCH1 is among the most frequently mutated genes in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC. These mutations are predicted to inactivate the function of Notch. Other studies have argued the opposite—Notch signaling is increased in HNSCC. Experimental Design: To assess the role of Notch signaling in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC, we utilized genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models for conventional keratinizing HNSCC, in which either HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins or a gain-of-function mutant p53 are expressed, and in which we inactivated canonical Notch signaling via expression of a dominant negative form of MAML1 (DNMAML1), a required transcriptional coactivator of Notch signaling. Results: Loss of canonical Notch signaling increased tumorigenesis in both contexts and also caused an increase in nuclear b-catenin, a marker for increased tumorigenic potential. When combined with loss of canonical Notch signaling, HPV oncogenes led to the highest frequency of cancers overall and the largest number of poorly differentiated (high-grade) cancers. Conclusions: These findings inform on the contribution of loss of canonical Notch signaling in head and neck carcinogenesis. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in the development and progression of multiple cancers by previous studies. Recently, a novel lncRNA, THOR (testis-associated highly conserved oncogenic long non-coding RNA), was characterized in human cancers and shown to exhibit an oncogenic role. However, the role of THOR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. In this study, we found that THOR was relatively highly expressed in human HCC tissues and cell lines. Notably, high THOR expression was associated with worse prognosis. THOR depletion resulted in significant inhibition of the growth and metastasis of HCC cells. Mechanistically, THOR drives HCC cell progression via the PTEN/AKT pathway. Moreover, the specific PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 abolished the discrepancy in the growth and metastatic capacity between THOR-silenced HCC cells and control cells, which further confirmed that AKT was required in THOR-driven HCC cell growth and metastasis. Taken together, our results suggest that THOR could promote HCC cell growth and metastasis by amplifying PTEN/AKT signaling and may be a new therapeutic target and predictive factor for HCC. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Concentrations of BTEX group (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) were measured in indoor and outdoor environments at four printing shops and two photocopy centers in Sakaka city, KSA. Fifty four BTEX samples were collected using passive diffusion monitors (SKC VOC 575) and analyzed by GC–MS. The results showed that toluene was the most prevailing compound within the BTEX group and its indoor levels were much higher than outdoor. The average indoor concentrations (μg/m3) ranged from 2.45 to 14.66, 81.59 to 955.65, 11.19 to 97.35, 35.66 to 291.88 and 3.90 to 28.39 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene and o-xylene, respectively. The indoor/outdoor ratios of concentrations of BTEX species were more than one in most cases, indicating the effect of indoor emission sources. Based on (Toluene/Benzene) ratios, all sites were affected by the traffic emissions. Ventilation efficiency, ink type and outdoor pollutant concentration are responsible for results disparity. Cancer and non-cancer risks were assessed in the indoor environments by calculating the lifetime cancer risk (LCR) and hazard ratio (HR), respectively. For benzene and ethylbenzene measured concentrations, LCR values were more than the acceptable USEPA risk level of 1 × 10−6. HR values for BTEX species were in general lower than the threshold limit of one. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The electrical properties of the cancer affected cell or malignant tumor cell are completely different from normal healthiest breast tissue. Specific absorption rate (SAR) is used as one of the best parameter to identify the malignant tissue in breast with the help of electrical properties of the human breast tissue, for example, permittivity and conductivity. The design of modified octagonal shaped ultra-wideband monopole microstrip antenna with size of 27 × 29 × 1.6 mm 3 , fabricated with FR-4 material, is found suitable for ultra-wideband applications and used to detect the cancer. The antenna impedance bandwidth of simulated and measured results are good (S 11 &lt; -10 dB) and its operating frequency ranges from 3 to 15 GHz with voltage standing wave ratio ≤ 2. A 3-D breast model is designed with 60 mm radius, and simulated SAR values are tabulated for skin, fatty tissue, glandular tissue, and tumor. As glandular tissue is one of the softest tissues in human female breast, it has the possibility of developing tumor in lobules and ducts. The tumors of different size are incorporated in glandular tissue. It is found that the SAR value varies based on the tumor size in glandular tissue. © 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Carbazole derivatives show anti-cancer activity and are of great interest for drug development. In this study, we synthesized and analyzed several new alkylamide derivatives of racemocin B, a natural indolo[3,2-a]carbazole molecule originally isolated from the green alga Caulerpa racemose. Several alkylamide derivatives were found to exhibit moderate to strong growth inhibition against human breast cancer cell lines. They induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Among these derivatives, compound 25 with the lowest IC 50 induced cell death by suppressing autophagy. This was accompanied by inhibition of autophagic flux and accumulation of autophagy protein 1 light chain 3, LC3II, and p62. The novel alkylamide derivative offers a potential new treatment for human breast cancer. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Several aromatase inhibitors have been prepared for treatment of breast cancer; nevertheless, their interaction with enzyme surface is not very clear. Therefore, the objective of this investigation was to synthesize and analyze the theoretical activity of five estrone derivatives (compounds 2-7) on aromatase (4kq8 protein) in a theoretical method using some aromatase antagonist (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) as controls. The data found showed that both anastrozole and compound 6 could interact with same aminoacid residues such as Ile133, Phe134, Phe221, Ala306, Asp309, Thr310, Val310, Val373, Met374, Leu477 and Ser478 that are involved in the 4kq8 protein surface. It is noteworthy that several of these aminoacid residues may be involved in the interaction between 4kq8 protein with compounds 2-5 and 7, these differences could induce significantly changes in the biological activity of aromatase through of interaction with 6 compared with the compounds 2-5 and 7. These results indicate that compound 6 could be a good candidate as an aromatase inhibitor which translates as a possible drug for breast cancer. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Several recent reports have highlighted the feasibility of the use of penfluridol, a well-known antipsychotic agent, as a chemotherapeutic agent. In vivo experiments have confirmed the cytotoxic activity of penfluridol in triple-negative breast cancer model, lung cancer model, and further studies have been proposed to assess its anticancer activity and viability for the treatment of glioblastomas. However, penfluridol anticancer activity was observed at a dosage significantly higher than that administered in antipsychotic therapy, thus raising the concern for the potential onset of CNS side effects in patients undergoing intensive pharmacological treatment. In this study, we evaluate the potential CNS toxicity of penfluridol side by side with a set of analogs. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis are tissue context-dependent processes. Cellular and non-cellular factors provide the selective microenvironment that determines the fate of the evolving tumor through mechanisms that include metabolic reprogramming. Genetic and epigenetic changes contribute to this reprogramming process, which is orchestrated through ongoing communication between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Metabolic flexibility, in particular the ability to rapidly adjust the balance between glycolytic and mitochondrial energy production, is a hallmark of aggressive, invasive, and metastatic cancers. Tumor cells sustain damage to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA during tumorigenesis and as a consequence of anticancer treatments. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mutations and polymorphisms are increasingly recognized as factors that influence metabolic reprogramming, tumorigenesis, and tumor progression. Severe mitochondrial DNA damage compromises mitochondrial respiration. When mitochondrial respiration drops below a cell-specific threshold, metabolic reprogramming and plasticity fail to compensate and tumor formation is compromised. In these scenarios, tumorigenesis can be restored by acquisition of respiring mitochondria from surrounding stromal cells. Thus, intercellular mitochondrial transfer has the potential to confer treatment resistance and to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding the constraints of metabolic, and in particular bioenergetic reprogramming, and the role of intercellular mitochondrial transfer in tumorigenesis provides new insights into addressing tumor progression and treatment resistance in highly aggressive cancers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Prolonged air leaks (PAL) are the most frequent complication after lobectomy for non–small cell lung cancer, even in case of minimally invasive approaches. We developed a novel score to identify high-risk patients for PAL during minimally invasive lobectomy. Methods: A dedicated database was created. We investigated preoperative candidate features and specific intraoperative variables. Univariate and subsequent logistic regression analysis with bootstrap resampling have been used. Model performance has been assessed by reckoning the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit. Results: PAL (>5 days) occurred in 72 (15.69%) patients. Five variables emerged from the model. Each one was assigned a score to provide a cumulative scoring system: forced expiratory volume in 1 second below 86% (P = 0.004, 1.5 points), body mass index <24 (P = 0.002, 1 point), active smoking (P = 0.001, 1.5 points), incomplete fissures (P = 0.004, 1.5 points), and adhesions (P = 0.0001, 1 point). The new score provided a stratification into four risk classes. Conclusions: The risk score incorporates either general or more specific variables, providing a risk stratification that could be readily applied intra- and postoperatively. Henceforth, specific technical and management measures could be properly allocated to curb PAL. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Melanoma is often characterized by a constitutively active RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. For targeted therapy, BRAF inhibitors are available that are powerful in the beginning but resistance occurs rather fast. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance is urgently needed to increase the success of the treatment. Here, we observed that SOX2 and CD24 are upregulated upon BRAF inhibitor treatment. A similar upregulation was seen in targeted therapy-resistant, melanoma-derived induced pluripotent cancer cells (iPCCs). SOX2 and CD24 are known to promote an undifferentiated and cancer stem cell-like phenotype associated with resistance. We, therefore, elucidated the role of SOX2 and CD24 in targeted therapy resistance in more detail. We found that the upregulation of SOX2 and CD24 required activation of STAT3 and that SOX2 induced the expression of CD24 by binding to its promoter. We find that the overexpression of SOX2 or CD24 significantly increases the resistance toward BRAF inhibitors, while SOX2 knock-down rendered cells more sensitivity toward treatment. The overexpression of CD24 or SOX2 induced Src and STAT3 activity. Importantly, by either CD24 knock-down or Src/STAT3 inhibition in resistant SOX2-overexpressing cells, the sensitivity toward BRAF inhibitors was re-established. Hence, we suggest a novel mechanism of adaptive resistance whereby BRAF inhibition is circumvented via the activation of STAT3, SOX2 and CD24. Thus, to prevent adaptive resistance, it might be beneficial to combine Src/STAT3 inhibitors together with MAPK pathway inhibitors. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "MMP-2/MMP-8 is established as one of the most important metalloenzymes for targeting cancer. A series of dihydropyrazothiazole derivatives (E1–E18) bearing a salicylaldehyde group linked to Pyrazole ring were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their pharmacological activity as MMP-2/MMP-8 inhibitors. Among them, compound E17 exhibited most potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 2.80 μM for MMP-2 and IC 50 = 5.6 μM for MMP-8), compared to the positive drug CMT-1 (IC 50 = 1.29 μM). Compounds (E1–E18) were scrutinized by CoMFA and CoMSIA techniques of Three-dimensional quant. structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR), as well as a docking simulation. Moreover, treatment with compound E4 could induce MCF-7 cell apoptosis. Overall, the biological profile of E1–E18 may provide a research basis for the development of new agents against cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Phycocyanin (PC), derived from cyanobacteria and Spirulina cells, is a type of natural antineoplastic marine protein. It has been reported that phycocyanin exerts an antitumor function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. In this research, a transcriptome study was performed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of phycocyanin on human NSCLC A549 cells. The survival rate and proliferation ability of A549 cells were markedly reduced by phycocyanin, along with abnormal morphologic changes. The transcriptome analysis showed that 2970 genes were differentially expressed after phycocyanin treatment in A549 cells, including 1431 down-regulated and 1539 up-regulated genes. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis suggested that some classical pathways, such as Wnt, NF-κB, and PI3K-AKT signaling, were significantly enriched. Strikingly, protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis showed that ubiquitin-C (UBC) occupied the highest degree (the highest number of interactions) in differential genes, indicating that it might play a key role in the phycocyanin-mediated regulatory process in A549 cells. Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed consistent expression trends of differential genes with transcriptome analysis. Consequently, this study has provided a theoretical basis for regulation of phycocyanin in A549 cells, which lays a foundation for the treatment of NSCLC. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "The intracellular effects and overall efficacies of anticancer therapies can vary significantly by tumor type. To identify patterns of drug-induced gene modulation that occur in different cancer cell types, we measured gene-expression changes across the NCI-60 cell line panel after exposure to 15 anticancer agents. The results were integrated into a combined database and set of interactive analysis tools, designated the NCI Transcriptional Pharmacodynamics Workbench (NCI TPW), that allows exploration of gene-expression modulation by molecular pathway, drug target, and association with drug sensitivity. We identified common transcriptional responses across agents and cell types and uncovered gene-expression changes associated with drug sensitivity. We also demonstrated the value of this tool for investigating clinically relevant molecular hypotheses and identifying candidate biomarkers of drug activity. The NCI TPW, publicly available at https://tpwb.nci.nih. gov, provides a comprehensive resource to facilitate understanding of tumor cell characteristics that define sensitivity to commonly used anticancer drugs. Significance: The NCI Transcriptional Pharmacodynamics Workbench represents the most extensive compilation to date of directly measured longitudinal transcriptional responses to anticancer agents across a thoroughly characterized ensemble of cancer cell lines. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "The function of acid ceramidase (ACDase), whose congenital deficiency leads to Farber disease, has been recognized to be vital to tumor cell biology, and inhibition of its activity may be beneficial in cancer therapy. Therefore, manipulation of the activity of this enzyme may have significant effect, especially on cancer cells. LCL521, Di-DMG-B13, is a lysosomotropic inhibitor of ACDase. Here we define complexities in the actions of LCL521 on ACDase. Systematic studies in MCF7 cells showed dose and time divergent action of LCL521 on ACDase protein expression and sphingolipid levels. Low dose of LCL521 (1 µM) effectively inhibited ACDase in cells, but the effects were transient. A higher dose of LCL521 (10 µM) caused a profound decrease of sphingosine and increase of ceramide, but additionally affected the processing and regeneration of the ACDase protein, with biphasic and reversible effects on the expression of ACDase, which paralleled the long term changes of cellular sphingosine and ceramide. Finally, the higher concentrations of LCL521 also inhibited Dihydroceramide desaturase (DES-1). In summary, LCL521 exhibits significant effects on ACDase in a dose and time dependent manner, but dose range and treatment time need to be paid attention to specify its future exploration on ACDase targeted cancer treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "In this work, ultrathin Ti3C2-MXene nanosheets were synthesized by minimally intensive layer delamination methods, and uniformly functionalized with aminosilane (f-Ti3C2-MXene) to provide a covalent binding for the immobilized bio-receptor (anti-CEA) for label free, ultrasensitive detection of cancer biomarker (carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA). The effect of different redox probes on the electrochemical behavior of f-Ti3C2-MXene was investigated and found that hexaammineruthenium ([Ru(NH3)6]3+) is the preferable redox probe for biosensing. The fabricated biofunctionalized Ti3C2-MXene exhibits a linear detection range of 0.0001–2000 ng mL−1 with sensitivity of 37.9 µA ng−1 mL cm−2 per decade. The wider linear detection range of our f-Ti3C2-MXene is not only higher than previously reported pristine 2D nanomaterials, but is even comparable to other hybrid 2D nanomaterials. We believe that this work opens a new window for development of MXene-based highly sensitive DNA, aptamer, enzyme, antibody, and cell based biosensors, and could be further used in drug delivery application. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Spontaneous rupture of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (srHCC) is a life-threatening emergency. We sought to identify the pre-operative predictors of early tumor recurrence/mortality including the role of inflammatory indices after partial hepatectomy for srHCC. Methods: Between 2000-2015, 79 patients with srHCC were identified to have undergone upfront partial hepatectomy following srHCC. Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively analyzed to identify pre-operative predictors of early (<1 year) recurrence and mortality. Results: Seventy-nine patients were identified to have undergone partial hepatectomy for srHCC. The 1-year mortality and 1-year recurrence rate in our series was 30.3% and 41.8% respectively. On multivariate analyses, free tumor rupture and a tumor size > 10 cm were identified to be independent predictors of early recurrence while an alpha fetoprotein (AFP) > 200 ng/mL was an independent predictor of early mortality. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio > 3 and prognostic nutritional index < 40 were predictors of early recurrence while PLR > 180 was a predictor of early mortality on univariate analyses but not multivariate analyses. Conclusions: Tumor size > 10 cm, free tumor rupture, and an AFP > 200 ng/mL were useful predictors in avoiding “futile surgery” in patients with srHCC undergoing a partial hepatectomy. Preoperative inflammatory markers appear to be less useful as predictors of early recurrence/mortality in this cohort of patients. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: We report the evolution of the largest, contemporary, single-institution experience with this complex procedure to highlight the value of a cross-discipline, team-based approach. Methods: Patients from a prospectively maintained database who underwent resection of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus from 2005 to 2016 at a single-institution were included for analysis. Results: Of 140 patients, 102 (73%) had tumor thrombus below the level of the hepatic vein confluence, and 96 (69%) were performed for curative-intent, while 43 (31%) were cytoreductive procedures for clinical trial consideration. Median overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 43.8 months (5-year OS:43%), and 73.6 months (5-year OS:59%) for those without metastatic disease. Fifty-one patients underwent resection from 2005 to 2010 and 89 from 2011 to 2016. All procedures since 2011 were performed by the same cross-discipline dedicated team of two surgeons, composed of a surgical and urological oncologist. When comparing the two time-periods, the team-approach after 2011 had shorter operative-times (5.3 vs 6.7 hours; P = 0.009), decreased ICU-utilization (25% vs 72%; P < 0.001), and decreased ICU length-of-stay (0.4 vs 2.2 days; P = 0.001). This group also trended towards less blood loss (1.2 vs 1.8 L), shorter average hospital length-of-stay (10 vs 11 days), and decreased 90-day mortality (6% vs 10%). Conclusion: Resection of RCC with IVC tumor thrombus yields long-term survival. A dedicated, cross-discipline, and team-based approach optimizes patient outcomes and may improve value of care by reducing utilization of expensive hospital resources. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: For several types of cancer, biological differences and outcome disparities have been documented in adolescents/young adults (AYAs, 15–39 years old) versus children. This study compared clinicopathological features and survival between younger AYAs and children with low-grade glioma (LGG), a common brain tumor among AYAs. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of Children’s Oncology Group legacy study CCG-9891/POG-9130, which enrolled participants 0–21 years of age with newly-diagnosed LGG treated with surgery alone. For analysis, participants were categorized as children (0–14 years old) or early AYAs (eAYAs, 15–21 years old) and compared on demographics, clinical presentation, tumor characteristics, surgical outcomes, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Among 468 children and 50 eAYAs, more eAYAs presented with seizures (34.0% vs. 19.2%; p = 0.015), without other significant differences in clinicopathological features. 5-year PFS rates for children and eAYA were 80.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 76.1–83.7) and 83.0% (95% CI 68.8–91.1), respectively; 5-year OS rates were 97.3% (95% CI 95.2–98.5) and 95.4% (95% CI 82.7–98.8), respectively. Multivariable analysis including all participants showed presence of residual tumor to be an independent predictor of PFS (&lt; 1.5 cm3, hazard ratio [HR] 5.93 [95% CI 3.45–10.18]) and (≥ 1.5 cm3, HR 8.38 [95% CI 4.75–14.79]) (p &lt; 0.001), while midline-chiasmatic location (HR 9.69 [95% CI 3.05–30.75], p &lt; 0.001) and non-pilocytic astrocytoma histology (HR 6.77 [95% CI 2.35–19.49], p &lt; 0.001) were independent predictors of OS. Conclusion: Unlike several other cancers, LGG has similar presenting features and survival for both eAYAs and children. This support continuing a unified treatment approach and enrollment of eAYAs in pediatric clinical trials for LGGs. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The use of ICT for health is known as e-health. Information System on the Acquisition and Classification of Cervical Cancer Image (ISAC) is one of e-health built on the basis of research in the field of cervical cancer image. Before applying ISAC, we need to analyze to see the readiness of user acceptance and adaptation so that it can be implemented optimally. This study aims to prove the main factors affecting the user intention to use SIPK on the basis of a combined model of the theory of planned behavior and the technology acceptance. The model testing in this research was done by using SPSS software. The result of this research obtained the factors influencing user acceptance in using ISAC as well as recommendation as an effort for improvement. These factors are perceived service availability which significantly influenced perceived ease of use, perceived ease of use which significantly influenced perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use that significantly influenced attitude toward using technology, perceived usefulness that significantly influenced attitude toward using technology, and attitude toward using technology significantly influencing behavioral intention to use. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.",

    "Abstract": "The adult well-male examination should provide evidence-based guidance toward the promotion of optimal health and well-being. The medical history should focus on tobacco and alcohol use, risk of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections, and diet and exercise habits. The physical examination should include blood pressure screening, and height and weight measurements to calculate body mass index. Lipid screening is performed in men 40 to 75 years of age; there is insufficient evidence for screening younger men. One-time screening ultrasonography for detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm is recommended in men 65 to 75 years of age who have ever smoked. Screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen testing in men 55 to 69 years of age should be individualized using shared decision making. Screening for colorectal cancer should begin at 50 years of age for average-risk men and continue until at least 75 years of age. Screening options include fecal immunochemical testing, colonoscopy, or computed tomography colonography. Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography is recommended in men 55 to 80 years of age who have at least a 30-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Immunizations should be updated according to guidelines from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. © 2018 American Academy of Family Physicians.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer may result in serious side effects, such as hyposalivation, impairing the patient's quality of life. Modern radiotherapy techniques attempt to reduce the dose to salivary glands, which, however, results in low-dose irradiation of the tissue stem cells. Here we assess the low-dose sensitivity of tissue stem cells and the consequences for tissue function. Experimental Design: Postirradiation rat salivary gland secretory function was determined after pilocarpine induction. Murine and patient-derived salivary gland and thyroid gland organoids were irradiated and clonogenic survival was assessed. The DNA damage response (DDR) was analyzed in organoids and modulated using different radiation modalities, chemical inhibition, and genetic modification. Results: Relative low-dose irradiation to the high-density stem cell region of rat salivary gland disproportionally impaired function. Hyper-radiosensitivity at doses <1 Gy, followed by relative radioresistance at doses 1 Gy, was observed in salivary gland and thyroid gland organoid cultures. DDR modulation resulted in diminished, or even abrogated, relative radioresistance. Furthermore, inhibition of the DDR protein ATM impaired DNA repair after 1 Gy, but not 0.25 Gy. Irradiation of patient-derived salivary gland organoid cells showed similar responses, whereas a single 1 Gy dose to salivary gland–derived stem cells resulted in greater survival than clinically relevant fractionated doses of 4 0.25 Gy. Conclusions: We show that murine and human glandular tissue stem cells exhibit a dose threshold in DDR activation, resulting in low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity, with clinical implications in radiotherapy treatment planning. Furthermore, our results from patient-derived organoids highlight the potential of organoids to study normal tissue responses to radiation. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Dual MAPK pathway inhibition (dMAPKi) with BRAF and MEK inhibitors improves survival in BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma, but the efficacy of dMAPKi in non-V600 BRAF mutant tumors is poorly understood. We sought to characterize the responsiveness of class II (enhanced kinase activity, dimerization dependent) BRAF mutant melanoma to dMAPKi. Experimental Design: Tumors from patients with BRAF wild-type (WT), V600E (class I), and L597S (class II) metastatic melanoma were used to generate patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We assembled a panel of melanoma cell lines with class IIa (activation segment) or IIb (p-loop) mutations and compared these with WT or V600E/K BRAF mutant cells. Cell lines and PDXs were treated with BRAFi (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib, and LY3009120), MEKi (cobimetinib, trametinib, and binimetinib), or the combination. We identified 2 patients with BRAF L597S metastatic melanoma who were treated with dMAPKi. Results: BRAFi impaired MAPK signaling and cell growth in class I and II BRAF mutant cells. dMAPKi was more effective than either single MAPKi at inhibiting cell growth in all class II BRAF mutant cells tested. dMAPKi caused tumor regression in two melanoma PDXs with class II BRAF mutations and prolonged survival of mice with class II BRAF mutant melanoma brain metastases. Two patients with BRAF L597S mutant melanoma clinically responded to dMAPKi. Conclusions: Class II BRAF mutant melanoma is growth inhibited by dMAPKi. Responses to dMAPKi have been observed in 2 patients with class II BRAF mutant melanoma. These data provide rationale for clinical investigation of dMAPKi in patients with class II BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Patients with recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) have limited effective options due to chemoresistance. A phase II study was designed to assess the activity of ENMD-2076, an oral multitarget kinase selective against Aurora A and VEGFR. Patients and Methods: This multicenter phase II study included patients with recurrent OCCC who received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Primary endpoints were objective response and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates. Correlative analyses include ARID1A and PTEN expression by IHC and gene sequencing with a targeted custom capture next-generation sequencing panel. Results: Forty patients were enrolled with a median age of 54, of which 38 patients were evaluable. ENMD-2076 was well tolerated with main related grade 3 toxicities being hypertension (28%), proteinuria (10%), and diarrhea (10%). Best response was partial response for 3 patients (1 unconfirmed) and stable disease for 26 patients. The overall 6-month PFS rate was 22% and differed according to ARID1A expression (ARIDIA vs. ARID1A þ ; 33% vs. 12%, P ¼ 0.023). PTEN-positive expression was observed in 20 of 36 patients, and there was no correlation with outcome. Median PFS in patients with PI3KCA wild-type versus PI3KCA-mutated group was 5 versus 3.7 months (P ¼ 0.049). Molecular profiling showed variants in PI3KCA (27%), ARID1A (26%), and TP53 (7%). The patient with the longest treatment duration (22 months) was PTEN wild-type, diploid PTEN with putative biallelic inactivation of ARID1A. Conclusions: Single-agent ENMD-2076 did not meet the preset bar for efficacy. Loss of ARID1A correlated with better PFS on ENMD-2076 and warrants further investigation as a potential predictive biomarker. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Bisphenol F (BPF), one of the alternatives to bisphenol A (BPA), can induce proliferation through the nuclear estrogen receptor ERα (estrogen receptor alpha) pathway in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. However, the roles of membrane estrogen receptor GPER1 (G-protein-coupled receptor 1)-mediated signaling pathways in MCF-7 cell proliferation caused by BPF are unclear. The influence of BPF on MCF-7 cells was evaluated in terms of cell proliferation, intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) fluctuations, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The molecular mechanisms of the cellular responses to low doses of BPF were studied through detecting the activations of ERα and GPER1-regulated PI3K/PKB or AKT (phosphatidylinotidol 3-kinase/protein kinase B) and ERK1/2 (extracellular-signa1-regulated kinase 1/2) signals. At 0.01–1 μM, BPF significantly promoted cell proliferation and elevated the levels of intracellular ROS and Ca 2+ . At these concentrations, BPF also significantly upregulated protein expressions of ERα, GPER1, c-myc, and cyclin D and phosphorylations of PKB and ERK1/2. Specific signal inhibitors decreased PKB and ERK1/2 phosphorylations and attenuated the effects of BPF. Silencing of GPER1 also significantly decreased BPF-induced cell proliferation. These results indicate that activating the GPER1-PI3K/PKB and ERK1/2 signals by low doses of BPF can regulate the response of MCF-7 cells and that ERα also influences the effects of exposure to BPF on the cells. The present study suggests a new mechanism by which BPF exerts relevant estrogenic action in cancer cells and also highlights the potential risks in using BPF as an alternative to BPA. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Chalcone (1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-one) derivatives exert anti-cancer activity by targeting key molecules that can lead to carcinogenesis. We synthesized the chalcone derivative 3-phenyl-1-(2,4,6-tris(methoxymethoxy)phenyl)prop-2-yn-1-one (KB-34) and previously reported its anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages. In this study, we examined the anti-metastatic activity of KB-34 against human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and elucidated its underlying molecular mechanisms. KB-34 treatment significantly inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced migration, as well as the invasion and proliferation of CRC cells (HT-29 and SW620). TPA-induced activation of NF-κB was also markedly suppressed by KB-34 in HT-29 cells. KB-34 suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) at both the mRNA and protein levels in TPA-stimulated CRC cells (HT-29 and SW620). We also demonstrated that induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in CRC cells (HT-29 and SW620) and HO-1 is required for KB-34-mediated suppression of the expression of MMP-7 in TPA-stimulated HT-29 cells. Additionally, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was significantly induced by treatment with KB-34 in CRC cells (HT-29 and SW620). Knockdown of HO-1 prevented the induction of p21 expression by KB-34 in HT-29 cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) together with KB-34 produced a significantly greater inhibition of growth and stimulation of apoptosis of HT-29 cells than did 5-FU alone. In conclusion, KB-34 inhibits the TPA-stimulated metastatic potential of HT-29 cells by induction of HO-1 and may be a promising anti-cancer agent in chemotherapeutic strategies for CRC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "[Figure not available: see fulltext.] A copper-catalyzed one-pot synthesis of fused benzothiazino[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-c]quinolinone derivatives from 1-iodoalkynes with different aryl azides via an in situ generated 5-iodotriazole intermediate in [BMIM]PF6 under microwave irradiation is reported. The reaction provided the desired fused 1,2,3-triazoles in good to excellent yields. Anticancer activity of the synthesized compounds has been screened in vitro against different cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HeLa, A-549, and IMR-32). Some of the derivatives showed remarkable anticancer activity against two cancer cell lines – MCF-7 and A-549. The remaining compounds have shown good to moderate activity against tested cell lines. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "A set of β-ketoesters was synthesized from 2,3-seco-18αH-oleanane and 2,3-secolupane bromomethyl ketones. Additionally, hydroxy derivatives with the A-seco- or five-membered A ring were obtained as a result of the reduction or of alkaline hydrolysis of acetic acid β-ketoesters 4, 9. Cytotoxic screening revealed the compound 4 with marked activity (IC50 3.07–3.61 µM) against the HCT 116, MS, RD TE32 cancer cells. The studies of the cytotoxic mechanism enabled elucidating the fact that treatment of the HCT 116 cells with compound 4 for 18 h leads to induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. This observation was confirmed by registration of chromatin condensation, by the fluorescence increased during Annexin V-FITC staining, and by appearance of a sub-G0 peak in the cell cycle analysis with DAPI. Compound 4 also inhibited migration of cancer cells in the wound healing assay. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "This study developed a portable and sensitive biosensor for the detection of telomerase activity extracted from HeLa cells by monitoring urease regulated pH change. In the presence of telomerase, the telomerase substrate (TS) primer was elongated by adding telomeric repeats (TTAGGG) n firstly. The TS primer was then immobilized onto streptavidin magnesphere paramagnetic particles (PMPs). The elongated repeat unit can hybridize with biotinylated complementary DNA (cDNA) to specifically capture biotinylated urease onto PMPs. After magnetic separation, the PMPs complex was mixed with urea solution. As urease can catalyze the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and induce pH increasing of the solution, the activity of telomerase can be detected by pH-sensitive dyes or by a portable pH meter easily. The changed pH has a linear relationship with the logarithm of the number of HeLa cells from 50 to 10,000 and with a detection limit of ~20 HeLa cells, which indicated the proposed method have potential application in telomerase-related cancer diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: In phase I testing, alisertib tablets with irinotecan and temozolomide showed significant antitumor activity in patients with neuroblastoma. This study sought to confirm activity of this regimen; evaluate an alisertib oral solution; and evaluate biomarkers of clinical outcomes. Patients and Methods: We conducted a two-stage phase II trial of alisertib tablets (60 mg/m2/dose 7 days), irinotecan (50 mg/m2/dose i.v. 5 days), and temozolomide (100 mg/ m2/dose orally 5 days) in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. The primary endpoint was best objective response. A separate cohort was treated with alisertib at 45 mg/m2 using oral solution instead of tablets. Exploratory analyses sought to identify predictors of toxicity, response, and progression-free survival (PFS) using pooled data from phase I, phase II, and oral solution cohorts. Results: Twenty and 12 eligible patients were treated in the phase II and oral solution cohorts, respectively. Hematologic toxicities were the most common adverse events. In phase II, partial responses were observed in 19 evaluable patients (21%). The estimated PFS at 1 year was 34%. In the oral solution cohort, 3 patients (25%) had first cycle dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Alisertib oral solution at 45 mg/m2 had significantly higher median Cmax and exposure compared with tablets at 60 mg/m2. Higher alisertib trough concentration was associated with first cycle DLT, whereas MYCN amplification was associated with inferior PFS. Conclusions: This combination shows antitumor activity, particularly in patients with MYCN nonamplified tumors. Data on an alisertib oral solution expand the population able to be treated with this agent. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Identification of early-stage pulmonary adenocarcinomas before surgery, especially in cases of subcentimeter cancers, would be clinically important and could provide guidance to clinical decision making. In this study, we developed a deep learning system based on 3D convolutional neural networks and multitask learning, which automatically predicts tumor invasiveness, together with 3D nodule segmentation masks. The system processes a 3D nodule-centered patch of preprocessed CT and learns a deep representation of a given nodule without the need for any additional information. A dataset of 651 nodules with manually segmented voxel-wise masks and pathological labels of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma (IA) was used in this study. We trained and validated our deep learning system on 523 nodules and tested its performance on 128 nodules. An observer study with 2 groups of radiologists, 2 senior and 2 junior, was also investigated. We merged AAH and AIS into one single category AAH-AIS, comprising a 3-category classification in our study. The proposed deep learning system achieved better classification performance than the radiologists; in terms of 3-class weighted average F1 score, the model achieved 63.3% while the radiologists achieved 55.6%, 56.6%, 54.3%, and 51.0%, respectively. These results suggest that deep learning methods improve the yield of discriminative results and hold promise in the CADx application domain, which could help doctors work efficiently and facilitate the application of precision medicine. Significance: Machine learning tools are beginning to be implemented for clinical applications. This study represents an important milestone for this emerging technology, which could improve therapy selection for patients with lung cancer. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Documentation of cellularity in Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is not performed on a regular basis in everyday clinical practice, but is recommended by the PSOGI (Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International). We investigated the impact of cellularity in PMP following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) on recurrence-free survival. Methods: Data from 25 patients with low-grade (American Joint Committee on Cancer grade G1) PMP were retrospectively evaluated. Cellularity was categorized as acellular mucin, scant (< 2% cellularity), moderate (2–19% cellularity), or high cellularity (> 20% cellularity). Impact of cellularity, PCI, CC-score, and HIPEC regimen on recurrence-free and overall survival was primarily assessed. Results: Assessment of cellularity showed acellular mucin in ten patients (40%), scant cellularity in 11 (44%) patients, moderate cellularity in one (4%) patient, and high cellularity in three (12%) patients. Median PCI was 15 (range, 1–39). A CC-0 score was achieved in 13 (52%) patients and a CC-1 score was achieved in 12 (48%) patients. After a median follow-up of 25 (range, 2–74) months, all patients were still alive. Overall, four (16%) patients suffered from recurrent disease after a median of 38 (range, 36–60) months. PCI above 17 (p = 0.03) and moderate and high cellularity (p = 0.007) were statistically significantly associated with recurrent disease. CC-score and HIPEC compound used did not impact on recurrence-free survival. Conclusions: Recurrent disease occurs more often in patients with PCI values above 17 and with moderate and high cellularity in low-grade PMP. Pathological assessment of cellularity is crucial for identification of patients at risk for recurrence. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the new treatment paradigm of staged stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of large brain metastases (BM) compared to the standard of surgical resection followed by SRS. Methods: We evaluated 78 patients with large BM treated 2012–2017 with surgical resection and postoperative SRS (surgery + SRS) or staged SRS separated by 1 month. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and compared across groups using the log-rank test. Cumulative incidence of neurologic death and local and distant brain failure (LF, DBF) were estimated using competing risk methodology. Results: Forty patients were treated with surgery + SRS and 38 patients were treated with staged SRS. Median follow-up was 23.2 months (95% CI 20.5–39.3). Median OS was 13.2 months for staged SRS compared to surgery + SRS 9.7 months (p = 0.53). Cumulative incidence of neurologic death at 1 year was 23% after surgery + SRS, 27% after staged SRS (p = 0.69); cumulative incidence of LF at 1 year was 6% and 8% (p = 0.65) and 1-year DBF was 59% and 21% (p ≤ 0.01). Overall rates of leptomeningeal failure and radiation necrosis were similar between the groups (p = 0.63 and p = 1.0). Conclusions: Though surgery and postoperative SRS is the standard, staged SRS represents an attractive treatment paradigm for treating large BM without sacrificing LC or survival, and potentially decreases DBF. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The microarrays permit experts to monitor the gene profiling for thousands of genes across an array of cellular responses, phenotype, and circumstances. Selecting a tiny subset of discriminate genes (biomarkers) from high dimensional data is one of the most significant tasks in bioinformatics. In this article, we develop a new hybrid framework by combining CMIM and AGA called CMIMAGA that can help to determine the significant biomarkers from the gene expression data. In the proposed approach, CMIM applied as a filter which is easy to understand and filter out most of the meaningless genes, and wrapper method as adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is employed to select the highly discriminating genes for distinguishing of instances from the reduced datasets. The AGA method uses the classifiers as a fitness function to select the relevant genes and to classify the tumour and cancer correctly. The performance of proposed approach is evaluated over six widely used microarray datasets using three classifiers, namely Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). The experimental results reveal that our approach with ELM achieves the goal of better classification accuracy with a minimum number of genes and outperform to other filter and wrapper approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib demonstrated single-agent clinical activity and preclinical synergy with vincristine/rituximab in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). This phase I study aimed to determine the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of alisertib in combination with rituximab vincristine in patients with relapsed/ refractory aggressive B-NHL. Patients and Methods: Patients with relapsed/refractory, diffuse, large, or other aggressive B-NHL received oral alisertib 50 mg b.i.d. days 1 to 7, plus i.v. rituximab 375 mg/m 2 on day 1, for up to eight 21-day cycles (MR). Patients in subsequent cohorts (3 þ 3 design) received increasing doses of alisertib (30 mg starting dose; 10 mg increments) b.i.d. days 1 to 7 plus rituximab and vincristine [1.4 mg/m 2 (maximum 2 mg) days 1, 8] for 8 cycles (MRV). Patients benefiting could continue single-agent alisertib beyond 8 cycles. Cell-of-origin and MYC/ BCL2 IHC was performed on available archival tissue. Results: Forty-five patients participated. The alisertib RP2D for MR was 50 mg b.i.d. For MRV (n ¼ 32), the RP2D was determined as 40 mg b.i.d. [1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at 40 mg; 2 DLTs at 50 mg]. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 89% of patients, the most common was neutropenia (47%). Seven patients had complete responses (CR), 7 had partial responses (PRs); 9 of 20 (45%) patients at the MRV RP2D responded (4 CRs, 5 PRs), all with non–germinal center B-cell (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Conclusions: The combination of alisertib 50 mg b.i.d. plus rituximab or alisertib 40 mg b.i.d. plus rituximab and vincristine was well tolerated and demonstrated activity in non-GCB DLBCL. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been effective for patients with CD19 þ B-cell malignancies. Most studies have investigated the second-generation CARs with either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains in the CAR receptor. Here, we describe the first clinical phase I/IIa trial using third-generation CAR T cells targeting CD19 to evaluate safety and efficacy. Patients and Methods: Fifteen patients with B-cell lymphoma or leukemia were treated with CAR T cells. The patients with lymphoma received chemotherapy during CAR manufacture and 11 of 15 were given low-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine conditioning prior to CAR infusion. Peripheral blood was sampled before and at multiple time points after CAR infusion to evaluate the persistence of CAR T cells and for immune profiling, using quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, and a proteomic array. Results: Treatment with third-generation CAR T cells was generally safe with 4 patients requiring hospitalization due to adverse reactions. Six of the 15 patients had initial complete responses [4/11 lymphoma and 2/4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)], and 3 of the patients with lymphoma were in remission at 3 months. Two patients are still alive. Best predictor of response was a good immune status prior to CAR infusion with high IL12, DC-Lamp, Fas ligand, and TRAIL. Responding patients had low monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs; CD14 þ CD33 þ HLADR) and low levels of IL6, IL8, NAP3, sPDL1, and sPDL2. Conclusions: Third-generation CARs may be efficient in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancy with only modest toxicity. Immune profiling pre- and posttreatment can be used to find response biomarkers. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Among different cancers, incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the highest. KRAS mutation is one of the underlying features in the pathogenesis of CRC with CRC tumors harboring mutant KRAS exhibiting a more aggressive behavior compared to CRC tumors with wild type KRAS. We had earlier shown that the microRNA-143 (miR-143) replenishment not only chemosensitizers CRC cell line with mutant KRAS instead of wild-type KRAS gene, to paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity, but also inhibits cell migration and invasion ability. Hence, the study aimed to determine how miR-143 replenishment is inhibiting pre-metastatic behavior in CRC cells with mutant KRAS. Top ten mRNA targets of miR-143 as predicted by TargetScan were evaluated by qRT-PCR in LoVo cells which were performed mock transfection or miR-143 mimic transfection. Evaluation of the changes in cognate mRNA target(s) was done in 30 paired CRC tissue and tumor adjacent normal tissue specimens and in LoVo cells by western blot. Effect of the mRNA target on pro-metastatic behavior was assayed by gain- and loss-of-function studies using a combination of western blotting and in vitro cell proliferation and transwell migration/invasion assay in LoVo cells and in the normal colonic epithelium cell line FHC. In vivo effect of the cognate mRNA target on CRC metastasis was assayed by xenograft assay. Of the 10 predicted mRNA targets, FOSL2 (P < 0.05) and IGFBP5 (P > 0.05) was down regulated in LoVo cells transfected with the miR-143 mimic. FOSL2 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated in CRC tissue specimens compared with adjacent normal tissue (P < 0.05). Immunoblot analysis showed that FOSL2, but not IGFBP5, protein expression is down regulated in LoVo cells after the miR-143 mimic transfection. FOSL2 overexpression in the normal colonic epithelial cell line FHC or siRNA-mediated silencing in LoVo cells induced and repressed, respectively, pro-mesenchymal cell features. Whereas manipulation of FOSL2 expression did not have any effect on cell proliferation rates, silencing its expression inhibited cell migration and invasion ability in vitro. In addition, silencing of FOSL2 expression in the LoVo cells can significantly inhibited invasion of hepatic, while no effect was found for tumorigenic potential. Our results suggest that FOSL2 is a critical regulator of CRC metastasis and might be an important marker for prognostic in CRC patients. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The response to cancer immune therapy is dependent on endogenous tumor-reactive T cells. To bypass this requirement, CD3-bispecific antibodies have been developed to induce a polyclonal T-cell response against the tumor. Anti-HER2/CD3 T-cell–dependent bispecific (TDB) antibody is highly efficacious in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing tumors in mice. Efficacy and immunologic effects of anti-HER2/CD3 TDB were investigated in mammary tumor model with very few T cells prior treatment. We further describe the mechanism for TDB-induced T-cell recruitment to tumors. Experimental Design: The immunologic effects and the mechanism of CD3-bispecific antibody-induced T-cell recruitment into spontaneous HER2-overexpressing mammary tumors was studied using human HER2 transgenic, immunocompetent mouse models. Results: Anti-HER2/CD3 TDB treatment induced an inflammatory response in tumors converting them from poorly infiltrated to an inflamed, T-cell abundant, phenotype. Multiple mechanisms accounted for the TDB-induced increase in T cells within tumors. TDB treatment induced CD8þ T-cell proliferation. T cells were also actively recruited post-TDB treatment by IFNg-dependent T-cell chemokines mediated via CXCR3. This active T-cell recruitment by TDB-induced chemokine signaling was the dominant mechanism and necessary for the therapeutic activity of anti-HER2/CD3 TDB. Conclusions: In summary, we demonstrate that the activity of anti-HER2/CD3 TDB was not dependent on high-level baseline T-cell infiltration. Our results suggest that anti-HER2/CD3 TDB may be efficacious in patients and indications that respond poorly to checkpoint inhibitors. An active T-cell recruitment mediated by TDB-induced chemokine signaling was the major mechanism for T-cell recruitment. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Radiomics is the extraction of multidimensional imaging features, which when correlated with genomics, is termed radiogenomics. However, radiogenomic biological validation is not sufficiently described in the literature. We seek to establish causality between differential gene expression status and MRI-extracted radiomic-features in glioblastoma. Experimental Design: Radiogenomic predictions and validation were done using the Cancer Genome Atlas and Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data glioblastoma patients (n ¼ 93) and orthotopic xenografts (OX; n ¼ 40). Tumor phenotypes were segmented, and radiomic-features extracted using the developed radiome-sequencing pipeline. Patients and animals were dichotomized on the basis of Periostin (POSTN) expression levels. RNA and protein levels confirmed RNAi-mediated POSTN knockdown in OX. Total RNA of tumor cells isolated from mouse brains (knockdown and control) was used for microarray-based expression profiling. Radiomic-features were utilized to predict POSTN expression status in patient, mouse, and interspecies. Results: Our robust pipeline consists of segmentation, radiomic-feature extraction, feature normalization/selection, and predictive modeling. The combination of skull stripping, brain-tissue focused normalization, and patient-specific normalization are unique to this study, providing comparable cross-platform, cross-institution radiomic features. POSTN expression status was not associated with qualitative or volumetric MRI parameters. Radiomic features significantly predicted POSTN expression status in patients (AUC: 76.56%; sensitivity/specificity: 73.91/78.26%) and OX (AUC: 92.26%; sensitivity/specificity: 92.86%/91.67%). Furthermore, radiomic features in OX were significantly associated with patients with similar POSTN expression levels (AUC: 93.36%; sensitivity/specificity: 82.61%/95.74%; P ¼ 02.021E15). Conclusions: We determined causality between radiomic texture features and POSTN expression levels in a preclinical model with clinical validation. Our biologically validated radiomic pipeline also showed the potential application for human–mouse matched coclinical trials. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a rare, aggressive brain tumor with no known cure. Reirradiation (reRT) at recurrence can prolong survival. The impact of irradiation may be heightened when combined with PD-1 inhibition. We describe our experience using reRT, with or without PD-1 inhibition, in a cohort of patients with recurrent DIPG. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of children who received reRT with or without concomitant PD-1 inhibition for recurrent DIPG at a single institution between 2005 and 2016. We compared progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between those who received reRT alone or in combination with PD-1 inhibition. We then compared reRT to a cohort of patients who did not receive reRT. Results: Thirty-one patients were included (8—reRT with nivolumab; 4—reRT alone; 19—no reRT). Patients who received reRT had prolonged OS compared to no reRT (22.9 months—reRT with nivolumab; 20.4 months—reRT alone; 8.3 months—no reRT; p < 0.0001). Patients who received reRT with nivolumab vs. reRT only had slightly prolonged OS from diagnosis and from reRT (22.9 vs. 20.4 months for time from diagnosis; 6.8 vs. 6.0 months for time from reRT). All patients receiving reRT with or without nivolumab tolerated the therapy without acute or late toxicity. Conclusions: Our experience demonstrates the tolerability of reRT with concurrent PD-1 inhibition for recurrent DIPG and suggests that combination therapy may offer survival benefit. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm the benefits of this combination therapy. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The Wuda coal fire area in Inner Mongolia, China, has existed for 50 years and been controlled by digging and backfilling for many years. However, few studies have focused on its impact on the local environmental and ecological systems due to emission of organic contaminants from the backfilled region. In the study, topsoil samples were collected at a 0–5 cm depth from the backfilled region of the Wuda coal fire area, which has existed for five years. The samples were analyzed for 16 priority control contaminants, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with a standard operation procedure and high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). The results showed that the total mass contentration of 16 PAHs (∑16PAHs) ranged from 279 to 8258 μg kg-1, with an average value of 2853 ± 2948 µg kg-1, which exceeded the stipulated limit for heavily contaminated soil (1000 μg kg-1). Among the 16 PAHs, 2- and 3-ring compounds accounted for more than half of ∑16PAHs. Furthermore, the results show that the main contaminants were the naphthalene (Nap), phenanthrene (Phe), pyrene (Pyr), chrysene (Chr), and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) in this area (24.8%, 51.1%, 3.9%, 4.5%, and 5.7% of ∑16PAHs, respectively). The diagnostic ratio of FLA/(FLA + PYR) exceeded 0.4 and IcdP/(IcdP + BghiP) was less than 0.5, indicating gentle smoldering or spontaneous combustion of coal fire, which differs from traditional coal burning. The environmental health risk or specifically the cancer risk (CR), calculated using the surface soil of the backfilled region, was 2.84 × 10-6 for adults and 1.01 × 10-6 for children, thus indicating potential cancer risks. Therefore, PAHs pollution in the surface soil of the backfilled region in the studied coal fire area is an issue that deserves urgent attention. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Polymethylmethacrylate core-shell fluorescent nanoparticles promote, in human lung A549 cancer cells, the internalization of a molecular beacon (MB) specific for survivin mRNA, an anti-apoptotic protein overexpressed in cancer cells. Aims: To design an effective drug delivery system, the knowledge of the uptake mechanism and of the nanoparticles (NPs) and MB fate is required. Materials and methods and key findings: Experiments with dextran as marker for endocytosis showed that in the presence of NPs the number of endocytic vesicles per cell doubled and their mean size significantly (p < 0.001) increased with respect to controls in absence of NPs, indicating an involvement of NPs in the endocytotic process. By using LysoTracker™ Deep Red, as marker of lysosomes, we found that nanoparticles co-localize with lysosomes. Moreover, a cellular release of nanoparticles detected in the culture medium, suggested a role of lysosomal exocytosis in nanoparticle elimination. The MB fluorescence in proximity of the labeled Endoplasmic Reticulum was indicative that the opening of the MB occurs in proximity of its target mRNA. Significance: The results show the involvement of endocytotic pathway in the uptake of NPs, which are an appropriate delivery system capable of being eliminated by cells. Furthermore the data confirm that the MB can be considered an effective tool for the intracellular sensing. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper was to assess the role of non-asbestiform amphibole EMPs in the etiology of mesotheliomas and other lung disease in taconite (iron ore) miners. Increased mesothelioma rates have been described in Minnesota taconite workers since the late 1990s. Currently, over 100 cases have been reported by the Minnesota Department of Health within the complete cohort of miners in Minnesota. Geologic sampling has indicated that only the eastern part of the iron range contains non-asbestiform amphibole elongate mineral particles (EMPs), in close proximity to the ore. This type of EMP has been less studied and also exists in talc and gold mining. A series of investigations into the state's taconite industry have been recently completed. Results from a cohort mortality study indicated an SMR of 2.77 (95% CI = 1.87–3.96) for mesothelioma. In a case-control study, the odds ratio for mesothelioma for high vs. low EMP exposure was 2.25 (5% CI = 1.13–4.5) but EMPs in this study were counted by phase contrast microscopy. Odds ratios were not elevated in mines located in the eastern part of the Mesabi iron range. The overall findings suggest that mesothelioma in taconite miners is related to EMP exposure. Because of the way EMPs were counted, results from these studies cannot allow a firm conclusion about the association between EMP exposure and the reported excess mesothelioma. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Great strides in gene discovery have been made using a multitude of methods to associate phenotypes with genetic variants, but there still remains a substantial gap between observed symptoms and identified genetic defects. Herein, we use the convergence of various genetic and genomic techniques to investigate the underpinnings of a constellation of phenotypes that include prostate cancer (PCa) and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in a human subject. Through interrogation of the subject's de novo, germline, balanced chromosomal translocation, we first identify a correlation between his disorders and a poorly annotated gene known as lipid droplet associated hydrolase (LDAH). Using data repositories of both germline and somatic variants, we identify convergent genomic evidence that substantiates a correlation between loss of LDAH and PCa. This correlation is validated through both in vitro and in vivo models that show loss of LDAH results in increased risk of PCa and, to a lesser extent, SNHL. By leveraging convergent evidence in emerging genomic data, we hypothesize that loss of LDAH is involved in PCa and other phenotypes observed in support of a genotype-phenotype association in an n-of-one human subject.",

    "Abstract": "Motivation: Given multi-platform genome data with prior knowledge of functional gene sets, how can we extract interpretable latent relationships between patients and genes? More specifically, how can we devise a tensor factorization method which produces an interpretable gene factor matrix based on functional gene set information while maintaining the decomposition quality and speed? Results: We propose GIFT, a Guided and Interpretable Factorization for Tensors. GIFT provides interpretable factor matrices by encoding prior knowledge as a regularization term in its objective function. We apply GIFT to the PanCan12 dataset (TCGA multi-platform genome data) and compare the performance with P-Tucker, our baseline method without prior knowledge constraint, and Silenced-TF, our naive interpretable method. Results show that GIFT produces interpretable factorizations with high scalability and accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how results of GIFT can be used to reveal significant relations between (cancer, gene sets, genes) and validate the findings based on literature evidence. Availability and implementation: The code and datasets used in the paper are available at https://github.com/leesael/GIFT. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "Abstract": "The latest molecular investigations leading to the discovery of the brand-new mechanisms associated to immortalized nature of cancer cells have questioned the efficacy of the conventional therapies and have increased the demand for more influential approaches, especially in the context of synergistic strategies. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treatment and to investigate the potential therapeutic value of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition synergism with chemotherapy, we designed experiments to evaluate the effect of Arsenic trioxide (ATO) in combination with BKM120 for the treatment of APL-derived NB4 cells. The results of the present study highlighted the favorable outcome of the PI3K inhibition using BKM120 in potentiating the anti-cancer effect of ATO, while reducing its cytotoxic concentration. Investigating the molecular mechanisms leading to this synergistic effect showed that probably down-regulation of the transcription factor SIRT1 coupled with suppression of c-Myc might halt the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 phase, resulting in the enhanced growth suppressive effect in ATO-plus-BKM120 combination. Moreover, we found that the positive regulatory role of the PI3K inhibition in augmenting the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species disturbed the balance between the death promoter and death repressor genes, which in turn amplified the caspase-3-dependent apoptotic activity of ATO in NB4. By and large, this study laid a therapeutic value on BKM120 in combination with ATO and suggested this combination as a novel therapeutic strategy that may be clinically accessible in the near future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Maximal surgical resection is associated with survival benefit in the majority of studies in adult diffuse glioma. This study aims to characterize the prognostic value of surgical resection in molecular subgroups of diffuse glioma. Methods: 1178 patients with diffuse glioma from our centers and 422 from TCGA dataset were collected. The Kaplan–Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression models were conducted to identify the prognostic value of surgical resection through different histological and molecular stratifications. Results: Firstly, we confirmed progression-free survival (PFS) benefit associated with gross total resection (GTR) over sub-total resection (STR) in lower-grade glioma (HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.17–1.90; P = 0.001). Intriguingly however, we were unable to detect a significant PFS or overall survival (OS) benefit in oligodendroglioma (N = 397; HR 1.36; 95% CI 0.86–2.14; P = 0.19 and HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.55–1.99; P = 0.89, respectively). Secondly, when analyzed in molecular subgroups, we were similarly unable to detect a significant PFS or OS benefit in IDH MT/codel subgroup (N = 269; HR 1.47; 95% CI 0.92–2.34; P = 0.11 and HR 1.54; 95% CI 0.78–3.05; P = 0.21, respectively), oligodendroglioma with IDH MT/codel subgroup (N = 233; HR 1.33; 95% CI 0.79–2.21; P = 0.28 and HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.53–2.54; P = 0.70, respectively) or other relevant subgroups. TCGA validation also showed a significant survival benefit in astrocytoma rather than oligodendroglioma. Exploratory RNAseq analysis displayed that fewer cell proliferation-related gene expression features were specific to oligodendroglioma. Conclusion: These results suggest that the benefit of maximal surgery may be attenuated in patients within oligodendroglioma relevant subgroups because of the chemosensitive and indolent nature. The aggressive surgery accompanying with risk of neurologic morbidity may be unnecessary for these patients given the lack of survival benefit with gross total resection. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The use of fractional differential operators (Riemann–Liouvillend Caputo) to model real world problems leads to a waiting time distribution governs by the power law. This operators obeys the so-called index law of the classical mechanic and also possess an artificial singularity around the initial or starting point of the process. There are failures or limitations attached to the power-law fractional differential operator: its capacity of obeying the index-law leads waiting time distribution with no crossover behavior which is a limitation for describing real world with statistical resetting and also spread or diffusion of some material in different scales, or some kind of anomalous spread like that of cancer. The second big problem is the singularity induced by the power law decay function, this singularity leads bad memory at the zero starting point. At this point, the prediction suggested by the model are not reliable as they can sometime misleading due to influence of the artificial singularity. The introduction of non-singular kernel is welcome in the field of fractional calculus as they brought news weapons in this field to accurately model real world problems, in particular diffusion or spread in different states. We welcome them in fractional calculus for two reasons: They do not lead to inclusion of artificial singularity into the mathematical models, in this case the history of the dynamical process. The second reason is their ability of describing the two different waiting times distribution, which is an ideal waiting time distribution as such is observed in many biological phenomena such as the spread of cancer. This crossover behavior of this new fractional differential operators is due to their capacity of not obeying the index law imposed in fractional calculus. The numerical simulations presented in this paper are in perfect agreement with the conclusion of the study done in Atangana (2018) where it was proved that, the index law is irrelevant in fractional calculus as the most important fact is the effect of the fractional differential operator to the associate evolution equation. We conclude in this paper that fractional differential operators not obeying index law are suitable mathematical tools to model real world problems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinoma (herein gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas) are associated with poor prognosis and limited systemic treatment options. To further understand the genomic landscape of gastroesophageal cancers and its clinical correlations, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients' plasma was evaluated using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Experimental Design: We analyzed genomic alterations of 55 patients (mostly advanced disease; 9, surgically resectable) with gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas using clinical-grade NGS performed on plasma-derived ctDNA (54–73 gene panel). The test detects single-nucleotide variants, as well as copy number amplifications, fusions, and indels in selected genes. Results: Seventy-six percent of patients (42/55) had 1 genomic alteration [including variants of unknown significance (VUS)] and 69.1% (38/55) had 1 characterized alteration (excluding VUSs). The median number of alterations per patient was 2 (range, 0–15). TP53 (50.9%, 28/55), PIK3CA (16.4%, 9/55), ERBB2 (14.5%, 8/55), and KRAS (14.5%, 8/55) genes were most frequently affected characterized alterations. Thirty-one patients also had tissue NGS. Concordance between tissue and ctDNA ranged from 61.3% (TP53 alterations) to 87.1% (KRAS alterations). ERBB2 alterations were significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR, 14.06; 95% confidence interval, 2.44–81.03; P ¼ 0.003 multivariate analysis). Among patients with 1 alteration, no 2 patients had identical molecular portfolios. All patients with 1 characterized alteration had theoretically targetable alterations by an FDA-approved agent (on- or off-label). Illustrative case treated with cognate agent is presented. Conclusions: Evaluation of ctDNA by NGS among patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is feasible. Patients harbored heterogeneous patterns of genomics, with most having alterations that are potentially pharmacologically tractable. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Initiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a complex process that includes both oncogene activation and tumor suppressor inhibition. The HBV X (HBx) protein has an important and complex role in processes leading to HCC. We previously identified the mammalian Zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) gene as an HCC-associated tumor suppressor gene. In the present study, we investigated whether the oncogenic properties of HBV and, more specifically, HBx, involved ZHX2 silencing. Our data indicates that ZHX2 expression is significantly decreased in tumor tissues from HBV-positive HCC patients and livers from HBV transgenic mice. In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that HBV-encoded proteins, particularly HBx, inhibits both the expression and tumor suppression properties of ZHX2. Further analyses identified miR-155, a well-known oncomiR in various cancers, as an important link between HBx and ZHX2 inhibition. Increased miR-155 levels were found in HBV-positive tumors, livers of HBV transgenic mice and HBx-overexpressing hepatoma cell lines. MiR-155 overexpression reduced ZHX2 levels via miR-155 seed sites in the ZHX2 3′UTR, whereas blocking miR-155 levels led to increased ZHX2 levels. Taken together, our data indicate that HCC-promoting properties of HBV may include ZHX2 silencing via a miR-155 dependent pathway and suggests a novel therapy for HBV-related HCC. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Targeted cancer therapeutics have demonstrated more limited clinical efficacy than anticipated, due to both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. Underlying mechanisms have been largely attributed to genetic changes, but a substantial proportion of resistance observations remain unexplained by genomic properties. Emerging evidence shows that receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) reprogramming is a major alternative process causing targeted drug resistance, separate from genetic alterations. Hence, the contributions of mechanisms leading to this process need to be more rigorously assessed. Methods: To parse contributions of multiple mechanisms to RTK reprogramming, we have developed a quantitative multi-receptor and multi-mechanistic experimental framework and kinetic model. Results: We find that RTK reprogramming mechanisms are disparate among RTKs and nodes of intervention in the MAPK pathway. Mek inhibition induces increased Axl and Her2 levels in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells while Met and EGFR levels remain unchanged, with Axl and Her2 sharing re-wiring through increased synthesis and differing secondary contributing mechanisms. While three Mek inhibitors exhibited mechanistic similarity, three Erk inhibitors elicited effects different from the Mek inhibitors and from each other, with MAPK pathway target-specific effects correlating with Erk subcellular localization. Furthermore, we find that Mek inhibitor-induced RTK reprogramming occurs through both BET bromodomain dependent and independent mechanisms, motivating combination treatment with BET and Axl inhibition to overcome RTK reprogramming. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that RTK reprogramming occurs through multiple mechanisms in a MAPK pathway target-specific manner, highlighting the need for comprehensive resistance mechanism profiling strategies during pharmacological development. © 2018, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In this research several series of novel dioxygenated ring fused 4-anilinoquinazolines (10a-d) and 4-anilinoquinazoline-substituted triazole hybrid compounds (11–14) have been designed and synthesized. Their biological significance was highlighted by evaluating in vitro for anticancer activities, wherein several compounds displayed excellent activity specifically against three human cancer cell lines (KB, epidermoid carcinoma; HepG2, hepatoma carcinoma; SK-Lu-1, non-small lung cancer). Especially, compound 13a exhibited up to 100-fold higher cytotoxicity in comparison with erlotinib. Docking the most cytotoxic compounds (11d, 13a, 13b, and 14c) into the ATP binding site of different EGFR tyrosine kinase domains was perfomed to predict the analogous binding mode of these compounds to the EGFR targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Many inbred strains of mice develop spontaneous tumors as they age. Recent awareness of the impacts of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) on cancer and aging has inspired developing a mitochondrial-nuclear exchange (MNX) mouse model in which nuclear DNA is paired with mitochondrial genomes from other strains of mouse. MNX mice exhibit mtDNA influences on tumorigenicity and metastasis upon mating with transgenic mice. However, we also wanted to investigate spontaneous tumor phenotypes as MNX mice age. Utilizing FVB/NJ, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeN, and BALB/cJ wild-type inbred strains, previously documented phenotypes were observed as expected in MNX mice with the same nuclear background. However, aging nuclear matched MNX mice exhibited decreased occurrence of mammary tumors in C3H/HeN mice containing C57BL/6J mitochondria compared to wild-type C3H/HeN mice. Although aging tumor phenotypes appear to be driven by nuclear genes, evidence suggesting that some differences are modified by the mitochondrial genome is presented. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "glycosylation was critical for maintaining the ligand dependence of the receptor. Mutation of the N610 site prevented membrane-proximal N-glycosylation of CSF3R, which then drove ligand-independent cellular expansion. Kinase inhibitors blocked growth of cells with an N610 mutation. This study expands the repertoire of oncogenic mutations in CSF3R that are therapeutically targetable and provides insight into the function of glycans in receptor regulation. Significance: This study reveals the critical importance of membrane-proximal N-linked glycosylation of CSF3R for the maintenance of ligand dependency in leukemiaMutations in the colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) have been identified in the vast majority of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia and are present in other kinds of leukemia, such as acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we studied the function of novel germline variants in CSF3R at amino acid N610. These N610 substitutions were potently oncogenic and activated the receptor independently of its ligand GCSF. These mutations activated the JAK–STAT signaling pathway and conferred sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. Mass spectrometry revealed that the N610 residue is part of a consensus N-linked glycosylation motif in the receptor, usually linked to complex glycans. N610 was also the primary site of sialylation of the receptor. Membrane-proximal N-linked © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) are a family of enzymes catalyzing the transformation of diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid, which have been recognized as key regulators in cell signaling pathways. The role of DGKγ in human malignancies has seldom been studied. In this study, we investigated the role of DGKγ in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that DGKγ was down-regulated in HCC tumor tissues and cell lines as compared to that in non-tumor tissues. The prognostic value of DGKγ expression was evaluated by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Lower DGKγ expression in tumor tissues was an independent prognostic factor for poor post-surgical overall survival. By using HDACs inhibitors treatment and ChIP-PCR, we discovered that histone H3 and H4 deacetylation mainly contributed to the downregulation of DGKγ expression. Functional studies revealed that ectopic expression of DGKγ inhibited cell proliferation and cell migration in HCC cells. Mechanism studies showed that DGKγ overexpression led to down regulation of GLUT1 protein level and AMPK activity, which result in glucose uptake suppression as well as lactate and ATP production declination. The decrease of GLUT1 level could be partially rescued by treatments with either DGK inhibitor and lysosome inhibitor, indicating DGKγ may down-regulate GLUT1 through its kinase activity and lysosome degradation process. Together, this study demonstrated that DGKγ plays a tumor suppressor role in HCC by negatively regulating GLUT1. DGKγ could be a novel prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for HCC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study evaluated the outcomes of radiotherapy (RT) for spinal ependymoma with adverse features, such as incomplete resection or disseminated disease. Methods: Twenty-five patients underwent RT for spinal cord ependymoma during 1991–2016. Twenty-four patients had gross disease on the pre-RT spinal magnetic resonance images. Six patients (24%) had disseminated disease. The World Health Organization grades were I (12 patients), II (12 patients), and III (1 patient). The RT fields were the tumor bed plus margin in 19 patients (76%), the entire craniospinal axis in 5 patients (20%), and the entire spinal canal with posterior cranial fossa in 1 patient (4%). The median RT dose was 50.4 Gy (range 44.0–59.4 Gy). Results: The median follow-up was 49 months (range 9–321 months), with 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates of 83.7% and 70.8%, respectively. Relative to patients with grade II/III ependymoma, patients with grade I ependymoma had higher 5-year rates of overall survival (100% vs. 69.4%, P =.088) and progression-free survival (100% vs. 42.3%, P =.02). Disease progression was observed in 4 patients who had grade II ependymoma, including 2 of 6 patients with disseminated disease and 2 of 19 patients with localized disease. Twelve patients (48%) exhibited improved neurological function. One patient who underwent craniospinal irradiation developed late hypopituitarism. No other RT-related late toxicities were observed. Conclusions: Favorable survival outcomes were achieved using RT for spinal ependymoma with adverse prognostic features. Thus, RT may be an effective treatment option when complete tumor removal cannot be achieved. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a widely used marker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and the increasing attention has been attracted on the development of rapid assay using biosensing technology. However, it remains challenging for the sensitive and selective detection of PSA in clinical samples. Here, we report a label-free microfluidic paper-based analytical device for highly sensitive electrochemical detection of PSA. The paper device was fabricated with wax printing to generate hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers for the construction of microfluidic channel, followed by screen-printing of three electrodes including working, counter and reference electrode. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/thionine (THI) nano composites were synthesized and characterized, which were coated onto working electrodes for the immobilization of DNA aptamer probe. THI servers as the electrochemical mediator to transduce the biological recognition between DNA aptamer and PSA, and the excellent conductivity of AuNPs and rGO also play a significant role of electron transfer, leading to a sensitive detection for PSA, able to detect PSA as low as 10 pg mL −1 , with a linear range from 0.05 to 200 ng mL −1 . We demonstrated that our electrochemical sensor for the detection of clinical serum samples, indicating that our sensor would provide a new platform for low cost, sensitive and point-of-care diagnosis of prostate cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A patient recently treated with surgery and radiation for oropharyngeal cancer presented with impending hypoxic respiratory and cardiac arrest in a difficult airway scenario. A CriCath cannula in combination with the Ventrain device and its active expiratory ventilation technology enabled oxygenation and ventilation for 60 minutes until a surgical airway was established. This case report is the first to describe the intended use of Ventrain technology in an emergent \"can't ventilate-can't intubate\" scenario.",

    "Abstract": "The effects of poly(lactic‑co‑glycolic acid) (PLGA) on structure, degradation, drug release and mechanical properties relationships of iron-based drug eluting scaffolds have been studied comprehensively. The porous structure of the iron has been incorporated with the curcumin-loaded PLGA (CP) particles through dipping method to produce CP-coated porous Fe (CP-Fe). The CP-Fe degradation has been escalated with the increase of PLGA composition due to the hydrolysis of PLGA. The degradation of iron substrate triggered the kinetics of curcumin release as there was a direct correlation between the curcumin release rate and the degradation rate of the CP-Fe scaffold. The stiffness of the CP particles and the interfacial interactions developed between the CP coating and iron surface have enhanced scaffolds' mechanical strengths. The curcumin released from the scaffold significantly arrested osteosarcoma cells growth. It is demonstrated that the PLGA played an important role to control the scaffold degradation and curcumin release as well as enhancing the mechanical properties of the drug device as an integrated system for favorable scaffold-based drug design. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: Human papillomavirus vaccination (HPVV) prevents several types of cancer. The American Cancer Society recently established a goal that by 2026, 80% of adolescents will be up to date (UTD) before their 13th birthday. However, the number in need of vaccination to reach this goal is unknown. This study estimated the number of additional adolescents (11-12 years old) who need HPVV for 80% prevalence to be reached by 2026. Methods: The study used de-identified and publicly available data and exempt from institutional review board approval and informed consent. The 2016 National Immunization Survey for Teens was used to estimate the baseline HPVV prevalence. Linear growth to 80% HPVV prevalence by 2026 was applied to set intermediate targets. US Census Bureau data were used for population projections. This study estimated the cumulative number of additional adolescents 11 to 12 years old who would need to become UTD (ie, receive 2 doses) by first subtracting the number who would need to be vaccinated to achieve an intermediate target prevalence from the estimated number currently compliant and then summing these numbers between 2018 and 2026. Results: Nationwide, an additional 7.62 million males (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.78 million to 8.40 million) and an additional 6.77 million females (95% CI, 5.95 million to 7.55 million), aged 11 to 12 years, would need to receive 2 doses of the vaccine between 2018 and 2026 for 80% prevalence to be achieved. Most adolescents not UTD (80%) also needed to initiate vaccination, and more than 90% recently visited a health care provider. Conclusions: It is estimated that at least 14.39 million additional adolescents aged 11 to 12 years in the United States will need to receive 2 doses of HPVV for a UTD HPVV prevalence of 80% to be achieved by 2026. To reach this goal, improvements in facilitators of HPVV initiation, including physician recommendations and parental acceptability, are needed. © 2018 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to thoroughly analyze the clinical characteristics of a large cohort of spinal meningioma (SM) from a single neurological center and identify risk factors associated with worse progression free survival and neurological function outcome. Methods: Clinical information was retrieved from 483 SM and 9806 cranial meningioma cases who were operated in our center between 2003 and 2013. 194 SM patients who were followed at the main branch were used for prognostic analyses that included both recurrence free survival and neurological functions based on Modified McCormick scale (MMS). Results: Females were predominant (P < 0.001). High grade tumors were not common (WHO grade II, 2.9%; grade III, 1.7%), while the clear cell subtype was frequent within grade II SMs (6/14, 42.9%). Macroscopic total resection was achieved in all SMs (Simpson grade I, 30.9%; grade II, 65.5%; grade III, 3.6%) with a low complications rate (4.6%) and provided neurological improvement in 80 patients (41.2%). Recurrence was seen in 9 cases (4.6%) and associated with high WHO grade, male, prior recurrence, and Simpson grade III. High WHO grade and high Ki-67 index were identified to be independent factors predictive of both neurological function deterioration and impaired post-operative neurological status. Conclusions: Our analysis of the largest SM cohort in scale from a single institution offers a comprehensive view of the clinical characteristics of surgically treated SM, revealing the distinct biology of SM in comparison to its cranial counterparts, and providing guidance to improve surgical management of SM. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment is rendered immunosuppressive by a variety of cellular and acellular factors that represent potential cancer therapeutic targets. Although exosomes isolated from ovarian tumor ascites fluids have been previously reported to induce a rapid and reversible T cell arrest, the factors present on or within exosomes that contribute to immunosuppression have not been fully defined. In this study, we establish that GD3, a ganglioside expressed on the surface of exosomes isolated from human ovarian tumor ascites fluids, is causally linked to the functional arrest of T cells activated through their TCR. This arrest is inhibited by Ab blockade of exosomal GD3 or by the removal of GD3 + exosomes. Empty liposomes expressing GD3 on the surface also inhibit the activation of T cells, establishing that GD3 contributes to the functional arrest of T cells independent of factors present in exosomes. Finally, we demonstrate that the GD3-mediated arrest of the TCR activation is dependent upon sialic acid groups, because their enzymatic removal from exosomes or liposomes results in a loss of inhibitory capacity. Collectively, these data define GD3 as a potential immunotherapeutic target. The Journ Al of Immunology, 2018, 201: 3750-3758. ©2018 by The American Association of Immunologists,Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A series of new coumarin tethered isoxazolines (7a-l) were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic potency against human melanoma cancer cell line (UACC 903) as well as fibroblast normal cell line (FF2441). Preliminary results revealed that some of these coumarin tethered isoxazolines 7b, 7c, 7f and 7j exhibited significant antiproliferative effect against human melanoma cancer (UACC 903) with IC50 values of 8.8, 10.5, 9.2 and 4.5 μM respectively. However, compound 7c was non-toxic to normal human cells at the tested concentration. Further, we have chosen compound 7c to check its efficacy in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma animal model in-vivo for its antitumor and antiangiogenic properties. Our lead compound significantly reduced the cell viability, body weight, ascites volume and downregulated the formation of neovasculature such as regression of tumor volume. The present study indicates the scope of developing into potent anticancer drug in near future. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: The dismal outcome in children with high-grade brainstem gliomas (BSG) accentuates the need for effective therapeutic strategies. We investigated the role of intensive, including marrow-ablative, chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of young children with newly-diagnosed high-grade BSG. Methods: Between 1991-and-2002, 15 eligible children less than 10 years of age with a diagnosis of high-grade BSG were treated on “Head-Start” I and II protocols (HSI and HSII). Treatment included Induction with 4–5 cycles of one of three intensive chemotherapy regimens followed by Consolidation with one cycle of marrow-ablative chemotherapy (thiotepa, carboplatin and etoposide) with autologous hematopoietic cell rescue (AHCR). Irradiation was required for children over 6 years of age or for those with residual tumor at the end of Consolidation. Results: We had two long-term survivors who were found retrospectively to harbor low-grade glial tumors and thus were not included in the survival analysis. Of the remaining 13 patients, the 1-year event-free (EFS) and overall (OS) survival for these children were 31% (95% CI 9–55%) and 38% (95% CI 14–63%), respectively. Median EFS and OS were 6.6 (95% CI 2.7, 12.7) and 8.7 months (95% CI 6.9, 20.9), respectively. Eight patients developed progressive disease during study treatment (seven during Induction and one at the end of Consolidation). Ten children received focal irradiation, five for residual tumor (three following Induction and two following Consolidation) and five due to disease progression.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the natural history of treated and untreated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-2 (CIN2) among HIV-positive women. METHODS: Participants were women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study between 1994 and 2013. One hundred four HIV-positive women diagnosed with CIN2 before age 46 were selected, contributing 2076 visits over a median of 10 years (interquartile range 5-16). The outcome of interest was biopsy-confirmed CIN2 progression, defined as CIN3 or invasive cervical cancer. CIN2 treatment was abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: Most women were African American (53%), current smokers (53%), and had a median age of 33 years at CIN2 diagnosis. Among the 104 HIV-positive women, 62 (59.6%) did not receive CIN2 treatment. Twelve HIV-positive women (11.5%) showed CIN2 progression to CIN3; none were diagnosed with cervical cancer. There was no difference in the median time to progression between CIN2-treated and CIN2-untreated HIV-positive women (2.9 vs. 2.7 years, P = 0.41). CIN2 treatment was not associated with CIN2 progression in multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 1.82; 95% confidence interval: 0.54 to 7.11), adjusting for combination antiretroviral therapy and CD4 T-cell count. In HIV-positive women, each increase of 100 CD4 T cells was associated with a 33% decrease in CIN2 progression (adjusted hazard ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval: 0.47 to 0.88), adjusting for CIN2 treatment and combination antiretroviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CIN2 progression is uncommon in this population, regardless of CIN2 treatment. Additional studies are needed to identify factors to differentiate women at highest risk of CIN2 progression.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objectives: The reasons behind the removal of the biopsy tract in osteosarcomas are not well known, and studies about tumor seeding in the biopsy tract have generated conflicting results. This study is designed to evaluate the presence and possible clinical significance of tumor cell seeding in the biopsy tract of osteosarcomas. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 55 cases of osteosarcomas for tumor cell seeding and other clinical and pathologic prognostic parameters. Results: Eleven cases (20%) involved microscopic tumor foci in the biopsy tract. The higher local recurrence rates (P = 0.005) and worse recurrence-free survivals (P = 0.009) were observed in patients with tumor cell foci in the biopsy tract. Mitotic rate, tumor cell pleomorphism, and matrix production in main tumor foci were higher in cases with tumor seeding (P = 0.047, P = 0.012, and P = 0.005, respectively). Conclusions: Tumor seeding in the biopsy tract is a fact in osteosarcomas. The higher local recurrence rates are more likely to occur in cases with tumor seeding. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Novel NF-κB inhibitors based on Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) derivatives containing aminophosphonate ester moieties were rationally designed and synthesized as well as evaluated their antitumor activities using MTT assay. Many target compounds showed potent antitumor activities against the tested human cancer cell lines including cisplatin-resistant cells, and exhibited significant inhibitory activity to the NF-κB with IC50 values at micromolar concentrations in A549 cells, respectively. Among them, compound 12e possessed excellent antitumor activities against the tested human cancer cell lines and showed low cytotoxicity toward to human normal liver cells. Moreover, 12e caused obvious loss of MMP and significantly induced ROS production, and displayed inhibition of cell migration against A549 cells in vitro. Importantly, 12e arrested the cell cycle at the S phases and ultimately induced cell apoptosis in A549 cells through blockage of NF-κB signaling pathway. Our research provided an efficient strategy for targeting NF-κB antitumor drug development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Like in many tumor types, immunotherapy is currently under investigation to assess its potential efficacy in glioblastoma patients. Trials are under way to assess the efficacy of new immune checkpoint inhibitors including anti-PD-1 or CTLA4. We here investigate the expression and efficacy of a novel immune-checkpoint inhibitor, called LAG-3. We show that LAG-3 is expressed in human glioblastoma samples and in a mouse glioblastoma model we show that knock out or LAG-3 inhibition with a blocking antibody is efficacious against glioblastoma and can be used in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors toward complete eradication of the model glioblastoma tumors. From a mechanistic standpoint we show that LAG-3 expression is an early marker of T cell exhaustion and therefore early treatment with LAG-3 blocking antibody is more efficacious than later treatment. These data provide insight and support the design of trials that incorporate LAG-3 in the treatment of glioblastoma. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Biocompatible, pH-sensitive and charge-conversion micelles derived from hyaluronic acid (HA), poly(lactide) (PLA) and half-generation of sectorial poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (sPA G4.5) were designed and fabricated to target delivery of docetaxel (DTX) to cancer cells. The novel micelles (HA-PALA-DTX) possessed stability against rat plasma and were capable of reversing surface zeta potential under acidic conditions in the presence of HAase. Moreover, the blank micelles demonstrated satisfactory biocompatibility and viability for biomedical applications. A cellular internalization experiment indicated that HA played an important role in increasing intracellular accumulation of DTX delivered by the micelles. Compared to Taxotere ® and PALA-DTX, HA-PALA-DTX showed an enhanced anticancer activity in vivo, with a tumor growth inhibition rate of 72.32 ± 5.22%. Overall, the functionalized micelles could be utilized as an alternative carrier for effective targeted delivery of anticancer agents to improve therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Estrogenic signals can regulate the progression of osteosarcoma (OS) via classic estrogen receptor α/β (ERα/β). G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) can mediate the non-genomic effects of estrogen and regulate the progression of various cancers. Our present study revealed that the expression of GPER in OS cells and tissues was lower than that in their corresponding controls. Activation of GPER via its specific agonist G-1 can decrease the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells. By screening the expression of cytokines involved in the progression of OS, we found that activation of GPER can inhibit the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in OS cells. Recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) or rIL-8 can attenuate G-1 suppressed migration of OS cells. Mechanically, activation of GPER can rapidly decease the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in OS cells. While over expression of p65 significantly attenuated G-1 induced down regulation of IL-6/IL-8. Further, G-1 can decrease the activation of p38-MAPK, which can further shorten the half-life of IL-8 mRNA. Collectively, we revealed that GPER can suppress the migration and invasion of OS cells via inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8. It suggested that GPER might be a potential therapy target for OS treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Enrichment and detection of rare cells are essential in many biological and medical applications. In this study, circulating tumor cells were detected by combining dielectrophoretic (DEP) manipulation and impedance measurement using circular microelectrodes within a single microfluidic device. A prototype of the device was fabricated through standard soft-lithography. With the proposed microchip, target cells (lung cancer cells, A549) were guided toward the center of the working region due to the action of positive DEP and hydrodynamic drag forces and were then trapped onto the desired sensing electrodes. Impedance was measured to identify the presence of cells. Impedance spectroscopy was conducted at different numbers of cells. Linear characteristics were found using differential analysis technique. Experimental results showed that the impedance sensor can detect A549 cell line with low cell number at the appropriate frequencies. Limit of detection (LOD) of approximately 3 cells was achieved at frequencies near 50 kHz. This simple, rapid, label-free, and low-cost approach may open up new opportunities for developing cell diagnosis systems for future applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Refractory ceramic fibers (RCFs) are amorphous fibers that belong to a class of materials termed synthetic vitreous fibers (SVFs), also called man-made mineral fibers (MMMFs), which includes alkaline earth silicate wool, glass wool, rock (stone) wool, slag wool, and special-purpose glass fibers. RCFs are more durable and biopersistent than several other SVFs, although very much less biopersistent than either amosite or crocidolite asbestos. Chronic inhalation studies indicated that rats and hamsters exposed to RCF fibers developed fibrosis and tumors. Epidemiological studies at the University of Cincinnati funded by the Industry indicated that exposed workers; (1) exhibited symptoms (e.g., dyspnea) similar to those reported in other dust-exposed populations, (2) developed statistically, but not clinically, significant deficits in certain measures of pulmonary function in a cross sectional study, but no excessive decline in a longitudinal study, and (3) a dose related increase in pleural plaques, but no interstitial fibrosis. The 2003 mortality study indicated no incremental lung cancer and no cases of mesothelioma. RCF producers developed a comprehensive industry wide product stewardship program (PSP) beginning in the late 1980s. In conjunction with the PSP, there has been a progressive decrease in the TWA concentration of fibers by manufacturers and end-users. The research program has successfully produced more soluble fibers and undertaken efforts to develop larger diameter fibers. The results of the ongoing epidemiology studies confirm that occupational exposure to RCF is associated with the development of pleural plaques and minor decrements in lung function, but no interstitial fibrosis or incremental lung cancer. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Some mineral fibers represent a health hazard because they are classified as cancer-causing chemical/physical toxicants upon (chronic) dust inhalation. Although in the last decades they have been the subject of intensive multidisciplinary investigations, the mechanisms by which mineral fibers induce toxic and pathogenic adverse effects on human health and environment are not yet fully understood. The major intricacy of the biological approach that prevents the design of a conclusive shared model of behavior of mineral fibers in a biological system stems from their very nature with intrinsic variability in chemical, molecular, structural and morphometric parameters, biodurability and surface reactivity. This paper presents the first attempt to devise a quantitative predictive model of toxicity/pathogenicity of minerals fibers based on their physical/chemical and morphological parameters. Although the author is aware that all parameters should be measured in comparable in vivo systems that accurately simulate the lung and or pleural environment, this preliminary model was conceived to deliver a fiber potential toxicity/pathogenicity index (FPTI) to be integrated with the biological approach so to create a quantitative predictive model of behavior of mineral fibers in a biological system. The FPTI model is thought to be a predictive tool aimed at ranking the toxicity and pathogenicity potential of fibers like asbestos or unregulated/unclassified mineral fibers. It may eventually be applied to other materials like man-made synthetic fibers and elongated mineral particles (EMP). Work is in progress to revise and validate the model in joint collaboration with international competent organizations, and to deliver a FPTI model-based user-friendly code. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Taxol (Paclitaxel) has been shown experimentally to counteract the depolymerization of microtubuline induced by calcium ions (Shigemori and Kobayashi, 2004) and hence to reduce the proliferation of cancer cells. In this work, we study at the molecular level by means of theoretical tools the interaction of Ca 2+ with the lateral chain of Taxol. Geometrical structure, interaction energy and wave function analysis are performed for all possible complexes. Our results show that two Taxol molecules can interact with a single calcium ion. This study is devoted to give new insights to rationally design new synthetic drugs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: When there is more than one potentially predictive biomarker for a new drug, the drug is often evaluated in different subpopulations defined by different biomarkers. We aim to (i) estimate the risk of false-positive findings with this approach and (ii) evaluate the cross-validated adaptive signature design (CVASD) as a potential alternative. Experimental Design: By using numerically simulated data, we compare the current approach and the CVASD across different settings and scenarios. We consider three strategies for CVASD. The first two CVASD strategies are different in terms of the partitioning of the overall significance level (between the population test and the subgroup test). In the third CVASD strategy, the order of the two tests is reversed, that is, the population test is realized when the prioritized subgroup test is not statistically significant. Results: The current approach results in a high risk of false-positive findings, whereas this risk is close to the nominal level of 5% once applying the CVASD, regardless of the strategy. When the treatment is equally effective to all patients, only the CVASD strategies could specify correctly the absence of a sensitive subgroup. When the treatment is only effective for some sensitive responders, the third CVASD strategy stands out by its ability to correctly identify the predictive biomarker(s). Conclusions: The drug–biomarker coevaluation based on a series of independent enrichment trials can result in a high risk of false-positive findings. CVASD with some appropriate adjustments can be a good alternative to overcome this multiplicity issue. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: STA-1474, prodrug of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor (HSP90i) ganetespib, previously demonstrated activity in canine preclinical models of cancer; interestingly, prolonged infusions were associated with improved biologic activity. The purpose of this study was to identify the ideal treatment schedule for HSP90i in preclinical models of KIT-driven malignancies and in dogs with spontaneous mast cell tumors (MCT), where KIT is a known driver. Experimental Design: In vitro and murine xenograft experiments and clinical studies in dogs with MCTs were used to define the effects of HSP90i-dosing regimen on client protein downregulation and antitumor activity. Results: Continuous HSP90 inhibition led to durable destabilization of client proteins in vitro; however, transient exposure required >10 drug for comparable effects. In vivo, KIT was rapidly degraded following a single dose of HSP90i but returned to baseline levels within a day. HSP90 levels increased and stabilized 16 hours after HSP90i and were not elevated following a subsequent near-term exposure, providing a functional pool of chaperone to stabilize proteins and a means for greater therapeutic activity upon HSP90i reexposure. HSP90i administered on days 1 and 2 (D1/D2) demonstrated increased biologic activity compared with D1 treatment in KIT or EGFR-driven murine tumor models. In a trial of dogs with MCT, D1/D2 dosing of HSP90i was associated with sustained KIT downregulation, 50% objective response rate and 100% clinical benefit rate compared with D1 and D1/D4 schedules. Conclusions: These data provide further evidence that prolonged HSP90i exposure improves biologic activity through sustained downregulation of client proteins. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "CASE DESCRIPTION A 2-year-old 5.2-kg (11.4-lb) neutered male domestic shorthair cat was referred because of a 6-week history of progressive paraparesis. CLINICAL FINDINGS Neurologic examination revealed moderate ambulatory paraparesis with marked spinal hyperesthesia at the thoracolumbar junction. The lesion was localized to the T3-L3 spinal cord segment. Clinicopathologic testing, thoracic radiography, and abdominal ultrasonography revealed no abnormalities to explain the observed clinical signs. Advanced spinal imaging with MRI revealed an extradural right-lateralized mass originating from the L2 vertebral pedicle and causing severe spinal cord compression. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Surgical decompression was achieved by performance of a right-sided hemi-laminectomy at L2. Histologic examination of biopsy samples obtained from the mass revealed an ill-defined zone of mature vascular proliferation extending through the preexisting vertebral bone, consistent with vertebral angiomatosis. After surgical recovery, adjuvant radiation therapy was initiated with a total dose of 48 Gy administered in 16 fractions of 3 Gy each over a 3-week period. Neurologic function rapidly improved to full ambulation with only minimal monoparesis of the right pelvic limb. Results of neurologic and MRI examination performed 26 months after surgery indicated no change in neurologic status or evidence of recurrence. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To the authors’ knowledge, this report was the first to describe the long-term outcome for vertebral angiomatosis in a cat. Surgical decompression and radiation therapy provided an excellent outcome in this case. Vertebral angiomatosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for any young cat with thoracolumbar myelopathy secondary to a mass associated with the vertebral pedicle. © 2018, American Veterinary Medical Association.

    "Abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) associated malignancy which is highly prevalent in Southeast Asia. EBV-related antibodies have been widely used as screening markers for early nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) detection. However, due to its low positive predictive rate, it is essential to develop new biomarkers to facilitate NPC early diagnosis or triage EBV serological high-risk individuals to improve the chance of NPC early detection. BART microRNAs, which are encoded by BamHI region of EBV, were reported to be abundant in NPC and have potential value in early diagnosis of NPC. Here, we quantified circulating level of 17 BART microRNAs in discovery stage based on previous microarray and sequencing data and, in particular, BART 2-5p, the sole candidate whose area under curve (AUC) was higher than 0.8, has been chosen for further study. In validation stage, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of BART 2-5p was 93.9%, 89.8%, 0.972 (95%CI: 0.954–0.989), respectively, in Cohort 1 constituted by NPC patients and controls from Hong Kong. For validation Cohort 2 consisting of patients and controls from Guangzhou, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC was 94.2%, 83.5%, 0.959 (95%CI: 0.939–0.980), respectively. To evaluate its ability to distinguish preclinical NPC patients, we established a nested case–control study with serum samples prospectively collected from 22 NPC patients prior to their clinical diagnosis and 88 matched healthy high-risk controls in a screening trial. The sensitivity and specificity were 90.9% and 54.5%. Collectively, EBV microRNA BART2-5p may be a valuable biomarker for early detection of NPC. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Extended resection is required for pancreatic adenocarcinoma infiltrating adjacent organs and structures. The role of laparoscopy in this setting is unclear. In this study, the outcomes of extended laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (ELDP) for pancreatic body/tail adenocarcinoma were examined. Methods: Perioperative and oncologic data were analyzed in patients undergoing laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) for adenocarcinoma at Oslo University Hospital. ELDP was defined as suggested by the International Study Group for Pancreatic Surgery. The outcomes of ELDP were compared to those following standard LDP (SLDP). Results: From August 2001 to June 2016, 460 consecutive patients underwent LDP for pancreatic neoplasms including 116 (25%) adenocarcinoma. SLDP and ELDP were applied in 78 and 31 patients, respectively. The adrenal gland (33%) and colon (21%) were the most frequently resected organs during ELDP. The latter was associated with larger tumor size (5.5 vs 4 cm, p = 0.03), longer operative time (236 vs 158 min, p = 0.001) and higher conversion rate (16 vs 3%, p = 0.019) compared with SLDP. Morbidity and 90-day mortality were similar. Median follow-up was 18 months. In patients with ductal adenocarcinoma, ELDP (n = 22) was associated with significantly shorter recurrence-free and overall survival than SLDP (n = 59) (6.2 vs 9.6 months, p = 0.047 and 12.9 vs 27 months, p < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Although technically challenging, ELDP is feasible in patients with adenocarcinoma providing acceptable surgical outcomes. ELDP for ductal adenocarcinoma is associated with worse prognosis than SLDP, while its potential benefits over palliative care deserve further scrutiny. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Aims and methods: Many antiviral agents have been reported to present direct cytotoxic activity in cancer, showing antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects through different mechanisms. In the present study, we took into account the cytotoxic action of the antiviral drug acyclovir (ACV) on leukemia cells, by investigating cell cycle perturbations and apoptosis induction upon drug administration to three still unexplored cell lines, namely Jurkat, U937, and K562. At the same time, the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (CDDP) and 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU) in combination with ACV was assessed, thus to evaluate if the antiviral agent could enhance cancer cell sensitivity to these chemotherapeutic drugs. Findings and significance: Our results showed that ACV cytotoxic action was maximum in Jurkat cells (acute T cell leukemia), which showed a dose- and time-dependent reduction of cell viability after drug exposure. The flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle revealed a delay/block in S phase and an increase of the sub-G1 peak upon ACV administration, thereby indicating apoptotic cell death. The activation of caspase-3 and the presence of nuclear DNA fragmentation confirmed the induction of apoptosis in ACV-treated cells. Interestingly, the pre-treatment of Jurkat cells with ACV for 72 h or 7 days increased CDDP and 5-FU cytotoxicity, suggesting enhanced leukemia cell sensitivity to these anticancer drugs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Herein, N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) functionalized Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (ABEI/MIL-101(Fe)) with intrinsic mimic peroxidase activity was synthesized and utilized as highly efficient ECL indicator to construct sensitive immunosensor for mucin1 (MUC1) detection. Firstly, compared with the traditional method for ABEI immobilization, the proposed strategy could successfully achieve the highly efficient ABEI immobilization as ABEI coupled 2-aminoterephhalic acid was used as organic bridge ligand. Moreover, the ABEI/MIL-101(Fe) containing the same luminescent group as luminol could emit strong light when using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a co-reactant. It is worth noting that the ECL signal of ABEI/MIL-101(Fe) could be greatly heightened due to the intrinsic mimic peroxidase activity of ABEI/MIL-101(Fe) that could accelerate the decomposition of H2O2 and produce considerable numbers of reactive oxygen radicals to participate in the ECL reaction of ABEI. The fabricated ECL immunosensor displayed a low detection limit of 1.6 fg mL−1 for MUC1, indicating that the synthesized ABEI/MIL-101(Fe) with intrinsic mimic peroxidase activity may be applied to realize ultrasensitive detection of other biomarkers in early diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The consumption of cytostatics has remarkably increased over the last years due to the high cancer incidence worldwide. In previous studies, seven cytostatics were already recognized to potentially induce chronic effects in aquatic organisms, taking into account their estimated concentrations in surface waters: cyclophosphamide (CYC), capecitabine (CAP), mycophenolic acid (MPA), imatinib (IMA), bicalutamide (BICA), prednisone (PRED) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The objective of the present study was to simultaneously analyse these 7 prioritized compounds, which have the highest chances to be found in surface and wastewaters. The analytical challenge relies in the determination of these very polar compounds, which have different chemical and structural properties. Solid-phase extraction with an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer in electrospray ionization mixed mode (5-fluorouracil and bicalutamide in negative mode and the others in positive one) was developed to determine seven cytostatics in wastewater and surface water. Among eight tested cartridges with different sorbents and conditions, the best extraction performance was attained with Oasis WAX at pH 10, with recoveries ranging from 31 ± 4 (5FU) and 103 ± 17% (MPA). Regarding the chromatographic analysis, the best results were achieved with an XBridge amide column. The final analytical methodology was successfully applied for the analysis of real water samples, confirming the presence of risky cytostatics in surface and wastewaters. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Chronic smoke exposure, emitted by biomass fuel burning leads to many diseases, which are originated due to oxidative stress. The present study investigated the levels of PM2.5, PM10 and PM2.5 bound trace metals released during cooking with fuelwood and subsequent changes in haematological parameters along with oxidative stress in rural tribal women of northeast India exposed to wood smoke. The levels of PM2.5, PM10 and trace metals associated with PM2.5 (nickel, cobalt, manganese, zinc, cadmium, lead and copper) were measured. In addition, blood samples were analyzed for concentrations of different blood related parameters (haemoglobin, platelet count, red blood cells and white blood cells) and levels of antioxidants (reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase). Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured as a biomarker of lipid peroxidation. Health risk assessment was done to assess the potential risk posed by inhalation of fine particles emitted from cooking with fuel wood. Levels of both PM2.5 and PM10 were higher in wood users compared to LPG users during cooking period (644.4 ± 368.3 µg/m³ vs 50 ± 23.8 µg/m³; 915 ± 441.3 µg/m³ vs 83.3 ± 33 µg/m³) and it exceeded the permissible limits of WHO. Levels of trace metals during the cooking period in fuel wood users were significantly higher than LPG users (p = 0.01). After controlling possible confounders, both platelet count and white blood cells (WBC) had a significant positive association with PM2.5and PM10. Similarly, haemoglobin had a negative association with both PM2.5 and PM10. Depleted levels of antioxidant enzymes and increase in lipid peroxidation (MDA) suggest a close association with pollutants released from wood smoke, indicating oxidative stress in women who used fuelwood for cooking. The total hazard quotient (HQ) of 0.11 was within the acceptable limit (i.e., 1.0). The total excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) was 5.4 × 10−6 which is five times higher than the acceptable limit of 1.0 × 10−6. Individual carcinogenic risk of Ni (2.3 × 10−6) and Cd (3.1 × 10−6) were also higher compared to acceptable limit. These results indicate that tribal women cooking with wood are at greater risk of developing cancer and also give support to the positive association between wood smoke and oxidative stress. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Epigenetic alterations play important roles in metastasis and drug resistance through gene regulation. However, the functional features and molecular mechanisms of epigenetic changes remain largely unclear in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) metastasis. Experimental Design: Gene regulatory network analysis was used to identify metastatic-specific dysregulated genes between normal and NPC tissues and the expression was validated in published Gene-Expression Omnibus data set. The regulatory and functional role of RAB37 downregulation was examined in NPC and was validated in vitro and in vivo, and downstream target of RAB37 was explored. The clinical value of RAB37 methylation was evaluated in NPC metastasis and chemosensitivity. Results: We identified RAB37 as a specific hypermethylated gene that is most commonly downregulated in NPC. Moreover, RAB37 downregulation was attributed to hypermethylation of its promoter and was significantly associated with metastasis- and docetaxel chemoresistance-related features in NPC. Ectopic RAB37 overexpression suppressed NPC cell metastasis and enhanced chemosensitivity to docetaxel. Mechanistically, RAB37 colocalized with TIMP2, regulated TIMP2 secretion, inhibited downstream MMP2 activity, and consequently altered NPC cell metastasis. Furthermore, RAB37 hypermethylation was correlated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with NPC. We developed a prognostic model based on RAB37 methylation and N stage that effectively predicted an increased risk of distant metastasis and a favorable response to docetaxel-containing induction chemotherapy (IC) in NPC patients. Conclusions: This study shows that RAB37 hypermethylation is involved in NPC metastasis and chemoresistance, and that our prognostic model can identify patients who are at a high risk of distant metastasis and might benefit from for docetaxel IC. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Osteonecrosis is a devastating complication of high-dose corticosteroid therapy in patients with cancer. Core decompression for prevention of bone collapse has been recently combined with the delivery of autologous concentrated bone marrow aspirates. The purpose of our study was to develop an imaging test for the detection of transplanted bone marrow cells in osteonecrosis lesions. Experimental Design: In a prospective proof-of-concept clinical trial (NCT02893293), we performed serial MRI studies of nine hip joints of 7 patients with osteonecrosis before and after core decompression. Twenty-four to 48 hours prior to the surgery, we injected ferumoxytol nanoparticles intravenously to label cells in normal bone marrow with iron oxides. During the surgery, iron-labeled bone marrow cells were aspirated from the iliac crest, concentrated, and then injected into the decompression track. Following surgery, patients received follow-up MRI up to 6 months after bone marrow cell transplantation. Results: Iron-labeled cells could be detected in the access canal by a dark (negative) signal on T2-weighted MR images. T2 relaxation times of iron-labeled cell transplants were significantly lower compared with unlabeled cell transplants of control patients who were not injected with ferumoxytol (P ¼ 0.02). Clinical outcomes of patients who received ferumoxytol-labeled or unlabeled cell transplants were not significantly different (P ¼ 1), suggesting that the added ferumoxytol administration did not negatively affect bone repair. Conclusions: This immediately clinically applicable imaging test could become a powerful new tool to monitor the effect of therapeutic cells on bone repair outcomes after corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Therapy with tumor-specific Abs is common in the clinic but has limited success against solid malignancies. We aimed at improving the efficacy of this therapy by combining a tumor-specific Ab with immune-activating compounds. In this study, we demonstrate in the aggressive B16F10 mouse melanoma model that concomitant application of the anti-TRP1 Ab (clone TA99) with TLR3-7/8 or -9 ligands, and IL-2 strongly enhanced tumor control in a therapeutic setting. Depletion of NK cells, macrophages, or CD8 + ; T cells all mitigated the therapeutic response, showing a coordinated immune rejection by innate and adaptive immune cells. FcγRs were essential for the therapeutic effect, with a dominant role for FcγRI and a minor role for FcγRIII and FcγRIV. FcγR expression on NK cells and granulocytes was dispensable, indicating that other tumoricidal functions of NK cells were involved and implicating that FcγRI, -III, and -IV exerted their activity on macrophages. Indeed, F4/80+Ly-6C+ inflammatory macrophages in the tumor microenvironment displayed high levels of these receptors. Whereas administration of the anti- TRP1 Ab alone reduced the frequency of these macrophages, the combination with a TLR agonist retained these cells in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the addition of innate stimulatory compounds, such as TLR ligands, to tumor-specific Ab therapy could greatly enhance its efficacy in solid cancers via optimal exploitation of FcγRs.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Glioma is the most common intracranial primary brain tumor. Patients with glioma often suffer from epilepsy, anxiety and depression. Aims of this study were to identify risk factors for drug-treated anxiety and depression, and to determine the use of psychiatric medication in a national glioma cohort. Methods: Data from the Cancer Registry of Norway on all persons diagnosed with glioma WHO grade II–IV 2004–2010 were linked with data from the Norwegian Prescription Database. Cox regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for drug-treated anxiety and depression. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for psychiatric medication dispensed to glioma patients and compared to the general population. Results: The glioma cohort consisted of 1056 males and 772 females. Of the 1828 patients, 565 had glioma grade II–III, and 1263 had grade IV. The patients with glioma grade II–III who were treated with levetiracetam had an increased risk for drug-treated anxiety compared to patients without levetiracetam; hazard ratio 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.7–4.9). Female gender increased the risk for drug-treated anxiety compared to males in patients with glioma grade IV; hazard ratio 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.2–2.0). Antidepressants were less frequently dispensed to patients with glioma grade II–III and epilepsy than to the general population. Conclusions: Patients with glioma grade II–III on levetiracetam had an increased risk for drug-treated anxiety. The subgroup of patients with glioma grade II–III and epilepsy received less antidepressants than the general population. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Uterine leiomyomas (ULs) are the most common gynecologic tumors and affect 3 of every 4 women by the age of 50 years. The majority of ULs are classified as conventional tumors, whereas 10% represent various histopathological subtypes with features that mimic malignancy. These subtypes include cellular and mitotically active ULs and ULs with bizarre nuclei. Uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS), the malignant counterpart of UL, is an aggressive cancer with poor overall survival. The early diagnosis and preoperative differentiation of ULMS from UL are often challenging because their symptoms and morphology resemble one another. Recent studies have shown frequent loss of alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death domain–associated protein (DAXX) expression in ULMS, and this is often associated with an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype. Methods: To investigate ATRX and DAXX expression and the presence of ALT in UL subtypes, immunohistochemical and telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were performed. The study material consisted of 142 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples representing various UL subtypes and 64 conventional ULs. Results: A loss of ATRX or DAXX and/or ALT was detected in 6.3% of the histopathological UL subtype samples (9 of 142). Two patients whose ULs showed either ATRX loss or ALT were later diagnosed with a pulmonary smooth muscle tumor. Pulmonary tumors displayed molecular alterations found in the corresponding uterine tumors, which indicated metastasis to the lungs. All conventional ULs displayed normal ATRX, DAXX, and telomeres. Conclusions: These results highlight the differences between conventional and histopathologically atypical ULs and indicate that some UL subtype tumors may harbor long-term malignant potential. © 2018 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Cell migration is essential to many life processes, including immune response, tissue repair, and cancer progression. A reliable quantitative characterization of the cell migration can therefore aid in the high throughput screening of drug efficacy in wound healing and cancer treatments. In this work, we report what we believe is the first use of SiR-Hoechst for extended live tracking and automated analysis of cell migration and wound healing. We showed through rigorous statistical comparisons that this far-red label does not affect migratory behavior. We observed excellent automated tracking of random cell migration, in which the motility parameters (speed, displacement, path length, directionality ratio, persistence time, and direction autocorrelation) obtained closely match those obtained from manual tracking. We also present an analysis framework to characterize the healing of a scratch wound from the perspective of single cells. The use of SiR-Hoechst is advantageous for the crowded environments in wound healing assays because as long as cell nuclei do not overlap, continuous tracking can be maintained even if there is cell-cell contact. In this paper, we report wound recovery based on the number of cells migrating into the wound over time, normalized by the initial cell count prior to the infliction of the wound. This normalized cell count approach is impervious to operator bias during the arbitration of wound edges and is also robust against variability that arises due to differences in the cell density of different samples. Additional wound healing characteristics were also defined based on the evolution of cell speed and directionality during healing. Not unexpected, the wound healing cells exhibited much higher tendency to maintain the same migratory direction in comparison to the randomly migrating cells. The use of SiR-Hoechst thus greatly simplified the automation of single cell and whole population analysis with high spatial and temporal resolution over extended periods of time. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The widespread existence of potentially toxic heavy elements have become one of the serious environmental concerns around the globe. Thus, it is highly important to develop efficient and selective chemical sensors to detect such potentially toxic elements. Herein, we developed a rhodamine-2-amino-5-bromopyrimidine based chemosensor (RBP) for the selective detection of toxic elements using Hg2+ and Cr3+ as model elements in combination with other competitive ions such as Al3+, Ag+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Li+, K+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Na+, Ni2+, Pb2+and Zn2+. The newly developed RBP displayed good visibility, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, high binding ability and low limit of detection in CH3CN/HEPES buffer (1 mM 3:2 v/v, pH 7.3) as a medium. The binding constants of RBP for Hg2+ and Cr3+ were 1.09 × 107 M−1 and 8.3 × 104 M−1, respectively. As compared to earlier reported studies, the lowest detection limits (LOD), i.e., 1.6 μM for Hg2+ and 4.9 μM for Cr3+ were recorded. RBP also show reversible binding affinity with Hg2+ and Cr3+ in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). The binding mode between metal ions and RBP were further investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which support the experimental findings very well. More importantly, RBP can be prepared as a test paper kit to detect the concentration of Hg2+ and Cr3+ ions by changing the color of the paper visible to naked eyes and is potential for the practical infield application. In addition, the results obtained from confocal microscopy revealed that the probe is cell permeable with low cytotoxicity and can be employed as a bio-imaging reagent for intracellular recognition of Hg2+ and Cr3+ ratification in human breast cancer cells MCF-7. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: In recent years, gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has become increasingly more popular as a salvage treatment modality for patients diagnosed with recurrent gliomas. The goal of GKRS for recurrent glioma patients is to improve survival rates with minimal burden for these patients. The emphasis of this report is on local tumor control (TC), clinical outcome and survival analysis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all patients who underwent GKRS for gliomas at the Gamma Knife Center Tilburg between 23-09-2002 and 21-05-2015. In total, 94 patients with glioma were treated with GKRS. Two patients were excluded because GKRS was used as a first stage treatment. The other 92 patients were included for analysis. Results: TC was 37% for all tumors (TC was 50% in LGGs and 27% in HGGs). Local progression (LP) was 46% for all tumors (LP was 31% in LGGs and 58% in HGGs). New distant lesions were seen in 18% of all patients (in 5% of LGG patients and 31% of HGG patients). Median progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS) for all patients were 10.5 and 34.4 months, respectively. Median PFS was 50.1 and 5.7 months for low and high grade tumors, respectively. Median OS was 86.6 and 12.8 months for low and high grade tumors, respectively. No serious adverse events were noted post-GKRS. Conclusion: GKRS can safely be used as salvage treatment for recurrent glioma and seems to improve survival rates in (high grade) glioma patients with minimal burden. © 2018, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We report low temperature solution process based synthesis of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) capped maghemite (γ-Fe2O3)-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites (IGPG and IGPP) and their comparative quantitative cell viability (CV) study on human OAW42 ovarian cancer cells. Initially, γ-Fe2O3-rGO (IG) nanocomposite was prepared and the IG was capped separately with PEG and PVP for obtaining IGPG and IGPP, respectively. The presence of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and organics in the nanocomposites was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies. The existence of a chemical interaction between the oxygen functionalities of rGO with the organic polymer (PEG/PVP) and maghemite was confirmed by FTIR and Raman spectral studies. Also, thermogravimetric analysis was made to understand the mass loss behavior of the samples. The IGPG showed better CV than IGPP. This observation was explained on the basis of materials properties of the nanocomposites. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Thousands of biomarker tests are either available or under development for lung diseases. In many cases, adoption of these tests into clinical practice is outpacing the generation and evaluation of sufficient data to determine clinical utility and ability to improve health outcomes. There is a need for a systematically organized report that provides guidance on how to understand and evaluate use of biomarker tests for lung diseases. Methods: We assembled a diverse group of clinicians and researchers from the American Thoracic Society and leaders from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute with expertise in various aspects of precision medicine to review the current status of biomarker tests in lung diseases. Experts summarized existing biomarker tests that are available for lung cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and other rare lung diseases. The group identified knowledge gaps that future research studies can address to efficiently translate biomarker tests into clinical practice, assess their cost-effectiveness, and ensure they apply to diverse, real-life populations. Results: We found that the status of biomarker tests in lung diseases is highly variable depending on the disease. Nevertheless, biomarker tests in lung diseases show great promise in improving clinical care. To efficiently translate biomarkers into tests used widely in clinical practice, researchers need to address specific clinical unmet needs, secure support for biomarker discovery efforts, conduct analytical and clinical validation studies, ensure tests have clinical utility, and facilitate appropriate adoption into routine clinical practice. Conclusions: Although progress has been made toward implementation of precision medicine for lung diseases in clinical practice in certain settings, additional studies focused on addressing specific unmet clinical needs are required to evaluate the clinical utility of biomarkers; ensure their generalizability to diverse, real-life populations; and determine their cost-effectiveness.

    "Abstract": "Hypoxic zones in solid tumors contribute to radioresistance, and pharmacologic agents that increase tumor oxygenation prior to radiation, including antiangiogenic drugs, can enhance treatment response to radiotherapy. Although such strategies have been applied, imaging assessments of tumor oxygenation to identify an optimum time window for radiotherapy have not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated the effects of a-sulfoquinovosylacyl-1,3-propanediol (SQAP or CG-0321; a synthetic derivative of an antiangiogenic agent) on the tumor microenvironment in terms of oxygen partial pressure (pO2), oxyhemoglobin saturation (sO2), blood perfusion, and micro-vessel density using electron paramagnetic resonance imaging, photoacoustic imaging, dynamic contrast–enhanced MRI with Gd-DTPA injection, and T2-weighted imaging with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) contrast. SCCVII and A549 tumors were grown by injecting tumor cells into the hind legs of mice. Five days of daily radiation (2 Gy) combined with intravenous injection of SQAP (2 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to irradiation significantly delayed growth of tumor xenografts. Three days of daily treatment improved tumor oxygenation and decreased tumor microvascular density on T2-weighted images with USPIO, suggesting vascular normalization. Acute effects of SQAP on tumor oxygenation were examined by pO2, sO2, and Gd-DTPA contrast-enhanced imaging. SQAP treatment improved perfusion and tumor pO2 (DpO2: 3.1 1.0 mmHg) and was accompanied by decreased sO2 (20%–30% decrease) in SCCVII implants 20–30 minutes after SQAP administration. These results provide evidence that SQAP transiently enhanced tumor oxygenation by facilitating oxygen dissociation from oxyhemoglobin and improving tumor perfusion. Therefore, SQAP-mediated sensitization to radiation in vivo can be attributed to increased tumor oxygenation.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: PD-1 blockade induces durable responses in patients with metastatic melanoma and prolongs relapse-free survival in patients with resected melanoma; however, current biomarkers do not consistently associate with patient responses. In this study, we investigated the impact of nivolumab therapy on peripheral blood regulatory T cells (Treg) and its relation to patient outcomes. Experimental Design: Peripheral blood Tregs and conventional CD4 þ T cells from patients with resected high-risk melanoma treated with adjuvant nivolumab were assessed for gene expression changes by RNA-seq. Percentages of circulating Tregs and phosphorylated-STAT3 (pSTAT3) expression levels were assessed by flow cytometry and validated in an independent cohort of active disease patients. Suppressive function of Tregs was assessed in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions. Results: Tregs from non-relapse patients had increased expression of proliferation associated genes. An increase in the proportion of circulating Tregs and pSTAT3 expression and a reduction in Treg-suppressive capacity were observed in non-relapsing, but not relapsing patient samples 13 weeks after starting treatment. In vitro blockade of PD-1 increased Treg percentages and pSTAT3 expression, and reduced Treg-suppressive function. PD-1 blockade also led to IL10 production by T cells, resulting in higher Treg proliferation. The addition of a STAT3 inhibitor ameliorated the increase in Tregs, enhanced suppressive function, and decreased T-cell IL10 production in vitro. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that induction of pSTAT3, reduced suppressive function, and a paradoxical increase in Treg proliferation are novel correlates of patient benefit from PD-1 blockade. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "[Figure not available: see fulltext.] A comparative analysis of physicochemical properties and reactivity of 3-aryl-1H-pyrazole-5-diazonium tetrafluoroborates and 5-aryl-3-diazo-3H-pyrazoles in azo coupling reactions is presented. It is shown that diazonium salts have higher reactivity compared to the respective 3-diazopyrazoles, which is in agreement with their physicochemical properties. Heterocyclization of the synthesized azo compounds provided 2-arylpyrazolo[5,1-c][1,2,4]benzotriazines, which were screened for antitumor activity against human uterine endothelium cancer cells (HeLa cell line) and human skin fibroblasts using the MTT assay and flow cytometry. It was found that all of the tested compounds exhibited moderate to high cytotoxic activity. The best results were obtained with 6,8-dimethoxy-2-phenylpyrazolo-[5,1-c][1,2,4]benzotriazine. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Dunaliella salina is a halotolerant microalga with high protein content. Until now, there was no report on biological properties of peptides prepared by enzymatic digestion of D. salina proteins. Therefore, antimicrobial and antiproliferative effects of the abundant protein of D. salina were investigated. The extracted proteins were separated by fast protein liquid chro-matography (FPLC), and protein hydrolysis was carried out with intestinal proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. The antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of the hydrolyzed peptides were examined on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Helicobacter pylori, and colon cancer cell lines, respectively. The results demonstrated that 63 kDa protein and its derived peptides caused a decrease in bacteria growth, and <3 kDa peptide fraction significantly reduced SW480 cell viability. Therefore, the peptide fractions with antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities are worthy of further investigation as functional food ingredients for health benefits. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Waldenstrom's € macroglobulinemia is an incurable lymphoproliferative disorder driven by an L265P mutation in the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88), which activates downstream NF-kB signaling through the Myddosome. As this pathway depends in part on activity of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs)-1 and -4, we sought to evaluate the potential of the IRAK1/4 inhibitor R191 in preclinical models. Experimental Design: Patient-derived cell lines and primary samples were used in both in vitro and in vivo experiments to model Waldenstrom's € macroglobulinemia and its response to IRAK1/4 inhibitors. Results: R191 induced a dose- and time-dependent reduction in viability of BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 Waldenstrom's € cell lines, and suppressed activation of IRAK1/4. This was associated with cell-cycle arrest at G 0 –G 1 , reduced levels of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, and induction of apoptosis in cell lines and primary patient samples. Further downstream, R191 exposure led to reduced activation of NF-kB, and of protein kinase B/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, whereas expression of a constitutively active Akt mutant induced R191 resistance. Gene expression profiling and gene set enrichment analysis revealed a signature consistent with inhibition of c-Myc and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. In both subcutaneous and systemic murine models of Waldenstrom's, € R191 showed antitumor activity. Finally, the activity of R191 was enhanced when it was combined with novel chemotherapeutics such as bortezomib, afuresertib, and ibrutinib. Conclusions: Taken together, these data support the translation of R191 as an approach to target IRAK1/4 to the clinic for patients with Waldenstrom's € macroglobulinemia. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "A novel series of aminopyrimidinylisoindoline derivatives 1a-w having an aminopyrimidine scaffold as a hinge region binding motif were designed and synthesized. Among them, six compounds showed potent inhibitory activities against AXL kinase with IC 50 values of submicromolar range. Especially, compound 1u possessing (4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl moiety exhibited extremely excellent efficacy (IC 50 = &lt;0.00050 μM). Their in vitro antiproliferative activities were tested over five cancer cell lines. Most compounds showed good antiproliferative activities against HeLa cell line. The kinase panel profiling of 50 different kinases and the selected inhibitory activities for the representative compound 1u were carried out. The compound 1u exhibited excellent inhibitory activities (IC 50 = &lt;0.00050, 0.025, and 0.050 μM for AXL, MER, and TYRO3, respectively) against TAM family, together with potent antiproliferative activity against MV4-11 cell line (GI 50 = 0.10 μM) related to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

The AXL assay is performed using the AXL Kinase Enzyme System (Promega, USA) and ADP-GloTM Kinase Assay Kit (Promega, USA). Because the AXL reaction utilizes ATP and generates ADP, the kinase reaction is terminated simultaneously and the remaining ATP is depleted, when the ADP-GloTM reagent is added. After the reaction, the kinase detection reagent is added, and then the ATP newly synthesized is converted to light, using the luciferase/luciferin reaction. First, the enzyme, substrate, ATP and inhibitor are diluted in kinase buffer. The mixture is added to the wells of 384 low volume plate: 1 µL of inhibitor or (5% DMSO), 2 µL of enzyme, and 2 µL of substrate/ATP mix. After incubated at room temperature for an hour, 5 µL of ADP-GloTM reagent is added. Again, incubate at room temperature for 40 min, and then add 10 µL of kinase detection reagent. Lastly, incubate at room temperature for 30 min and record luminescence; Selected data.

Lung cancer cells (A549), glioblastoma cells (U87-MG), cervix adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), ovarian carcinoma cells (OVCAR-3), and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep G2) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Stock cultures were grown in 5 mL RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Extracted cells in 96-well plates (100 µL cells/well) were exposed to different sample concentrations in DMSO/RPMI. And then, they are incubated at 37 oC with 5% CO2 for 2 days. Afterwards, cells were fixed with 50% trichloroacetic acid and cell proliferation was estimated by spectrophotometric quantification (540 nm wavelength) of cellular protein content. The measurements were obtained three times (time zero, 48 hr post-incubation for compound free, and tested cells) and concentration-response curve for each cell line was plotted through an equation. For the concentration-response curve for each cell line, TGI (concentration that produces 100% of cell growth inhibition) value was determined",

    "Abstract": "Background: The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and aspirin both have proof of concept for colorectal cancer chemoprevention, aligned with an excellent safety profile. Therefore, we aimed to test the efficacy of EPA and aspirin, alone and in combination and compared with a placebo, in individuals with sporadic colorectal neoplasia detected at colonoscopy. Methods: In a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial trial, patients aged 55–73 years who were identified during colonoscopy as being at high risk in the English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP; ≥3 adenomas if at least one was ≥10 mm in diameter or ≥5 adenomas if these were <10 mm in diameter) were recruited from 53 BCSP endoscopy units in England, UK. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1:1) using a secure web-based server to receive 2 g EPA-free fatty acid (FFA) per day (either as the FFA or triglyceride), 300 mg aspirin per day, both treatments in combination, or placebo for 12 months using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, and stratified by BCSP site. Research staff and participants were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the adenoma detection rate (ADR; the proportion of participants with any adenoma) at 1 year surveillance colonoscopy analysed in all participants with observable follow-up data using a so-called at-the-margins approach, adjusted for BCSP site and repeat endoscopy at baseline. The safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry, number ISRCTN05926847. Findings: Between Nov 11, 2011, and June 10, 2016, 709 participants were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (176 to placebo, 179 to EPA, 177 to aspirin, and 177 to EPA plus aspirin). Adenoma outcome data were available for 163 (93%) patients in the placebo group, 153 (85%) in the EPA group, 163 (92%) in the aspirin group, and 161 (91%) in the EPA plus aspirin group. The ADR was 61% (100 of 163) in the placebo group, 63% (97 of 153) in the EPA group, 61% (100 of 163) in the aspirin group, and 61% (98 of 161) in the EPA plus aspirin group, with no evidence of any effect for EPA (risk ratio [RR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·87 to 1·12; risk difference −0·9%, −8·8 to 6·9; p=0·81) or aspirin (RR 0·99 (0·87 to 1·12; risk difference −0·6%, −8·5 to 7·2; p=0·88). EPA and aspirin were well tolerated (78 [44%] of 176 had ≥1 adverse event in the placebo group compared with 82 [46%] in the EPA group, 68 [39%] in the aspirin group, and 76 [45%] in the EPA plus aspirin group), although the number of gastrointestinal adverse events was increased in the EPA alone group at 146 events (compared with 85 in the placebo group, 86 in the aspirin group, and 68 in the aspirin plus placebo group). Six upper-gastrointestinal bleeding events were reported across the treatment groups (two in the EPA group, three in the aspirin group, and one in the placebo group). Interpretation: Neither EPA nor aspirin treatment were associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with at least one colorectal adenoma. Further research is needed regarding the effect on colorectal adenoma number according to adenoma type and location. Optimal use of EPA and aspirin might need a precision medicine approach to adenoma recurrence.

    "Abstract": "LSD1 is implicated in a number of malignancies and has emerged as an exciting target. As part of our sustained efforts to develop novel reversible LSD1 inhibitors for epigenetic therapy of cancers, in this study, we reported a series of stilbene derivatives and evaluated their LSD1 inhibitory activities, obtaining several compounds as potent LSD1 inhibitors with IC50 values in submicromolar range. Enzyme kinetics studies and SPR assay suggested that compound 8c, the most active LSD1 inhibitor (IC50 = 283 nM), potently inhibited LSD1 in a reversible and FAD competitive manner. Consistent with the kinetics data, molecular docking showed that compound 8c can be well docked into the FAD binding site of LSD1. Flow cytometry analysis showed that compound 8c was capable of up-regulating the expression of the surrogate cellular biomarker CD86 in THP-1 human leukemia cells, suggesting the ability to block LSD1 activity in cells. Compound 8c showed good inhibition against THP-1 and MOLM-13 cells with IC50 values of 5.76 and 8.34 μM, respectively. Moreover, compound 8c significantly inhibited colony formation of THP-1 cells dose dependently. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are crucial in the regulation of protein-protein interactions and protein function in cell signaling. Here, we studied the interaction between the transactivation domain peptide of cancer suppressor protein p53 and its negative regulator Mdm2 using a novel protein-protein interaction assay, based on the modified FlimPIA using the streptavidin-biotin interaction to link the p53 peptide and the probe enzyme. We succeeded in detecting an attenuation in the affinity of p53 towards Mdm2 caused by the phosphorylation at Thr18. It showed that the targets, which are not easy to fuse with the FlimPIA probes, such as phosphorylated peptides can be used in this system. Also, the use of streptavidin nanobeads was found effective to get clearer signal, probably due to concentration of the detection system onto the bead surface. The system was further applied to the detection of FKBP-FRB interaction using biotinylated FKBP domain, which suggested another potential merit of this system that allows to avoid misfolding and steric hindrance often observed for the fusion protein approach. © 2018",
