    "Abstract": "Cantharidin (CTD), a terpenoid defensive toxin mainly produced by blister beetles, is widely known by its toxicity to both cancer cells and pests. However, little information is known about its biosynthesis in blister beetles. In this study, first we determined the CTD content in various tissues of adult blister beetles on different days after mating, and then detected the temporal and spatial expression patterns of genes related to CTD biosynthesis in Epicauta chinensis. Results revealed that the accessory gland is the source of the highest CTD production. The second highest level was in the fat body in male blister beetles after mating. In females, the highest CTD content was in the reproductive system except the ovary after mating. As revealed by messenger RNA expression level analysis, the highest levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA reductase (HMGR) and juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase (JHEH) transcripts of E. chinensis were observed in the fat body in males after mating. However, the highest transcript level of EcHMGR was in the ovary and EcJHEH was maintained at a nearly similar level in females. The transcript level of methyl-farnesoate epoxide was significantly higher in the head and that of CYP4BM1 in the midgut in both male and female E. chinensis. We speculate that the fat body may play a more important role than other tissues on the CTD biosynthesis in male E. chinensis after mating. There may be multiple tissues involved in the process of CTD biosynthesis. These four genes probably play regulatory roles in different tissues in males. © 2017 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",

    "Abstract": "Molecular alterations in cell death pathways and imbalances in regulators of up- or downstream signaling pathways can lead to resistance to cell death, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. These signaling modifications are strategies that tumor cells use to resist chemotherapy and that contribute to the high recurrence rate of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The SET oncoprotein is a PP2A inhibitor that accumulates in HNSCC and represents a promising therapeutic target. Here we report the role that SET protein plays in resistance to death of two HNSCC cell lines: Cal 27 and HN13. SET protein regulated intracellular redox balance by controlling cellular localization of APE 1 - an endonuclease that is part of the SET complex and regulates antioxidant gene transcription. SET protein knockdown (siSET) associated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced oxidative stress sensitized Cal 27 and HN13 cells to apoptosis via the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, respectively. SET protein upregulated autophagy in HNSCC cells in a PP2A-dependent manner and apparently regulated ULK1 expression. The fact that siSET lowered Bcl-2 phosphorylation levels indicated that SET protein interfered with an alternative pathway that modulated autophagy in HNSCC cells. Overall, SET protein regulated intracellular redox state and sustained autophagy in HNSCC cells, which may explain resistance to death of HNSCC cells. Altogether, the findings reported herein support SET protein as therapeutic target for HNSCC. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This population-based study considered the influence of rituximab on the survival of children (0–19 years), adolescents, and young adults (AYAs, 20–39 years) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Methods: Data on 642 children and AYAs diagnosed with DLBCL during 2001–2014 were obtained from the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry in California. Facility-level reports provided treatment details. The Kaplan–Meier method estimated survival and Cox regression models examined the association between survival and rituximab use, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. Results: Rituximab use increased from 2001–2007 to 2008–2014 among children (from 32% to 48%), AYAs (from 68% to 84%), and HIV patients (from 57% to 67%). Five-year survival was higher among children (91%) than AYAs (82%). On multivariable analysis, the hazard of death was 44% lower among rituximab recipients, and higher among uninsured patients, those with HIV, and those with advanced stage at diagnosis. HIV patients who received rituximab were 60% less likely to die than nonrecipients. Conclusions: Our study suggests a benefit of rituximab on the treatment of AYAs and HIV patients with DLBCL. The worse survival observed among HIV-positive and uninsured patients is of concern and calls for further investigation. Careful consideration should be given on whether to recommend rituximab more often on the front-line treatment of children and HIV-positive patients with DLBCL. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Ru(II) compounds are potential candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and auxiliary ligands may have an impact on the property of the resulting coordination compounds. In the present study, two Ru(II) compounds based on 5-(2-pyrazinyl)tetrazole (Hpztz) and two classic auxiliary ligands, 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy) or 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) have been prepared and characterized, namely [Ru(pztz)(bipy) 2 ][PF 6 ] (1) and [Ru(pztz)(phen) 2 ][PF 6 ] (2). The nanoparticles (NPs) of the two compounds have been prepared by self-assembly in aqueous solution. In vitro MTT assay on HeLa cells show that [Ru(pztz)(phen) 2 ][PF 6 ] with a lower IC 50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of only 7.4 μg/mL is superior to that of [Ru(pztz)(bipy) 2 ][PF 6 ] (17.8 μg/mL) under irradiation. Meanwhile, negligible dark toxicity have been also observed for the two compounds. In addition, in vivo fluorescence imaging suggests that [Ru(pztz)(phen) 2 ][PF 6 ] NPs are able to target to the tumor by enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). Furthermore, in vivo phototherapy on nude mice demonstrate that such NPs can effectively inhibit the growth of the tumor. After treatment for 10 cycles, an obvious decrease in the tumor volume can be observed while the normal tissues, including heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney, suffer from no damage, indicating the high phototoxicity, low dark toxicity and excellent biocompatibility of [Ru(pztz)(phen) 2 ][PF 6 ] NPs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The role of clinician-measured breast length and bra cup size in the development of radiodermatitis over time and the efficacy of using multiple measurements of skin toxicity during radiotherapy were piloted. The feasibility of measures to be used in a larger future study was assessed. Methods and materials: Participants included women receiving normofractionated or accelerated external breast radiotherapy provided in the supine position using 3-dimensional conformal techniques at a US community cancer center. Acute skin toxicity was assessed using the RTOG scale in 7 areas within the treatment field across 6 timepoints. The total score for the 7 areas was calculated each week. Breast length was measured, examined as an acute radiodermatitis risk factor, and compared against reported bra cup size. RM-ANOVAs examined radiodermatitis using maximum skin toxicity and 7 sites in the radiotherapy field over 6 timepoints. Correlation was implemented to explore the relationship between study variables. Results: Forty women consented to this study. Increase in breast length significantly correlated with increase in maximum RTOG score (p =.04); increased RTOG score in the upper medial breast quadrant (p =.04), upper lateral quadrant (p =.02), lower lateral quadrant (p =.02), inframammary fold (p =.001); with increasing BMI (p =.002) and bra cup size (p =.0003). The clinician-measured breast lengths and participant-reported bra cup sizes were discordant. Participants completed all measures and measurements including breast length. Conclusions: Our results suggest that measuring breast length and assessing radiodermatitis in multiple areas of the treatment field is feasible. These measures may increase the sensitivity of skin toxicity assessment. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Radical hysterectomy is performed for invasive cervical cancer. In this surgery, separation of the anterior leaf and posterior leaves of the vesicouterine ligament (VUL) is important. We studied the local anatomy of the anterior leaf of the VUL, especially the branches of the umbilical artery from the view point of surgery and cadaver dissection. Study Design: We observed the cervicovesical blood vessels and the connective tissue layer continued from umbilical artery and searched for the origin of the cervicovesical blood vessels in radical hysterectomy. We also dissected a formalin-fixed female cadaver, and observed the same points. Results: After separation of the connective tissue of urinary bladder from the cervical fascia, we could discern the outline of the distal ureter near the ureterovesical junction. We separate the connective tissue of the so-called anterior leaf of the VUL enwrapping the ureter gently, and then the ureter with the connective tissue is completely rolled out laterally. We identified a cervicovesical vessel crossing over the ureter. We looked for the central side of the cervicovesical vessel and found that cervicovesical vessel was a branch of the superior vesical artery. And, during cadaver dissection, we found that the connective tissue and the branches of the superior vesical artery were similarly observed. Conclusions: We found the precise anatomy of the connective tissue layer from umbilical artery to urinary bladder and the superior vesical artery. Our procedure based on the precise anatomy obtained in this study is reasonable anatomically as a method for separation of the vesicouterine ligament during radical hysterectomy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Deriving human health risk estimates for environmental chemicals has traditionally relied on in vivo toxicity databases to characterize potential adverse health effects and associated dose-response relationships. In the absence of in vivo toxicity information, new approach methods (NAMs) such as read-across have the potential to fill the required data gaps. This case study applied an expert-driven read-across approach to identify and evaluate analogues to fill non-cancer oral toxicity data gaps for p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p’-DDD), an organochlorine contaminant known to occur at contaminated sites in the U.S. The source analogue p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its no-observed-adverse-effect level of 0.05 mg/kg-day were proposed for the derivation of screening-level health reference values for the target chemical, p,p’-DDD. Among the primary similarity contexts (structure, toxicokinetics, and toxicodynamics), toxicokinetic considerations were instrumental in separating p,p’-DDT as the best source analogue from other potential candidates (p,p’-DDE and methoxychlor). In vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assays from ToxCast were used to evaluate similarity in bioactivity profiles and make inferences toward plausible mechanisms of toxicity to build confidence in the read-across approach. This work demonstrated the value of NAMs such as read-across and in vitro HTS in human health risk assessment of environmental contaminants with the potential to inform regulatory decision-making. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "This work reports the biological evaluation of a copper complex of the type [Cu(O–O)(N–N)ClO 4 ], in which O–O = 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione (Hbta) and N–N = 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), whose generic name is CBP-01. The cytotoxic effect of CBP-01 was evaluated by resazurin assay and cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Cell cycle progression was detected through propidium iodide (PI) staining. Apoptosis and autophagy were determined by, respectively, Annexin V and 7-AAD staining and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. The changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were detected by DCFDA analysis. The copper complex CBP-01 showed in vitro antitumor activity with IC 50 s values of 7.4 μM against Sarcoma 180 and 26.4 against murine myoblast cells, displaying selectivity toward the tumor cell tested in vitro (SI &gt; 3). An increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was observed, which may be related to the action mechanism of the complex. The complex CBP-01 may induce DNA damage leading cells to accumulate at G0/G1 checkpoint where, apparently, cells that are not able to recover from the damage are driven to cell death. Evidence has shown that cell death is initiated by autophagy dysfunction, culminating in apoptosis induction. The search for new metal-based drugs is focused on overcoming the drawbacks of already used agents such as acquired resistance and non-specificity; thus, the results obtained with CBP-01 show promising effects on cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Nine novel cobalt(III) ternary complexes bearing 4N donor ligands (tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (tren) or tris(2-methylpyridyl)amine (tpa)) and (fluoro)quinolones (quinH) with antibacterial and potential antitumor activity have been synthesized, characterized and screened in various biological assays. The molecular structures of [Co(tpa)(nal)](PF 6 ) 2 (3) and [Co(tpa)(nor)(Co(tpa)(norH)](PF 6 ) 3 (Cl) 2 ∙5MeOH (8) (nal = deprotonated form of nalidixic acid, norH = norfloxacin) with the expected octahedral geometry and (O,O) coordination of the quinolone ligands are also reported. Cyclic voltammetric studies revealed that the 4N donor ligands have much higher effect on the reduction potential of these ternary complexes than the quinolones. Due to the π-back-bonding interaction of the metal ion with the pyridyl-N atoms, the tpa containing compounds demonstrated lower stability and were easier to get reduced in a reversible manner. This character makes them unlikely candidates for development of effective, highly selective hypoxia-activated pro-drug complexes, but this goal might be achieved by substitution of tpa by tren. [Co(tren)(cip)](PF 6 ) 2 (4) and [Co(tpa)(cip)](PF 6 ) 2 (5) (cip = deprotonated form of ciprofloxacin) showed slightly less antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli than free ciprofloxacin (cipH) and they found to have very low toxicity towards both selected cancer (HeLa, MCF 7, MDA-MB-239) and noncancerous (MRC5 pd30) cells. Interaction of 4 and 5 with calf thymus DNA studied by UV–Vis, flow linear dichroism, viscometry and DNA melting indicated the complexes to bind to DNA as intercalators. DNA electrophoresis revealed that, unlike Co(II) complexes, 4 and 5 are not capable of cleaving DNA, but they can inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase 5 being slightly more active than 4. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To evaluate whether digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) can predict if circumscribed masses are benign or malignant by assessing margin sharpness. Materials and methods: Circumscribed masses were evaluated on co-registered two-dimensional digital mammography (2DDM) and DBT. Lesions were categorised as follows: category 1=visible sharp border 0–25% of the total margin; category 2 = 26–50% category 3= 51–75%, and category 4=76–100%. Changes in category between 2DDM and DBT were analysed; if the category was lower on DBT the change was negative, if higher the change was positive. Results: Of 759 lesions, 121 masses classified as circumscribed on DBT were included; 25 were malignant and 96 benign. Of the benign lesions, 8/96 were within category 3 or 4 on 2DDM compared with 48/96 benign lesions within category 3 or 4 on DBT (Fisher's exact test p<0.000527). Forty-eight of 51 (94.1%) lesions categorised as 3 or 4 on DBT were benign and 65/67 (97.01%) of the positive category change group were benign. Lesions in category 1 on DBT had 45.4% chance of being malignant (20/44) compared with 22.72% (20/88) on 2DDM (chi-squared test p<0.001). Sixty-five of 67 (97.01%) lesions in the positive category change group were benign and 23/54 (42.6%) lesions with either no or negative category change were malignant. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates 97% accuracy in predicting circumscribed lesions as benign when using positive category change and 94% accuracy when >50% of the margin is sharply defined on DBT. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "UV irradiation is a major driver of DNA damage and ultimately skin cancer. UV exposure leads to persistent radicals that generate ROS over prolonged periods of time. Toward the goal of developing long-lasting antioxidants that can penetrate skin, we have designed a ROS-initiated protective (RIP) reagent that, upon reaction with ROS (antioxidant activity), self-cyclizes and then releases the natural product apocynin. Apocynin is a known antioxidant and inhibitor of NOX oxidase enzymes. A key phenol on the compound 1 controls ROS-initiated cyclization and makes 1 responsive to ROS with a EC50 comparable to common antioxidants in an ABTS assay. In an in vitro DNA nicking assay, the RIP reagent prevented DNA strand breaks. In cell-based assays, the reagent was not cytotoxic, apocynin was released only in cells treated with UVR, reduced UVR-induced cell death, and lowered DNA lesion formation. Finally, topical treatment of human skin explants with the RIP reagent reduced UV-induced DNA damage as monitored by quantification of cyclobutane dimer formation and DNA repair signaling via TP53. The reagent was more effective than administration of a catalase antioxidant on skin explants. This chemistry platform will expand the types of ROS-activated motifs and enable inhibitor release for potential use as a long-acting sunscreen. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and characterized by metastasizing and infiltrating adjacent and distant tissues. Notably, microRNA-1271 (miR-1271) is a tumor suppressor in various cancers. Therefore, we evaluate the ability of miR-1271 to influence cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in HBV-associated HCC through the Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway via targeting CCNA1. HBV-associated HCC and adjacent normal tissues were collected to identify the expression of miR-1271 and CCNA1. To verify the relationship between miR-1271 and CCNA1, we used bioinformatics prediction and the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The effects of miR-1271 on HBV-associated HCC cell behaviors were investigated by treatment of the miR-1271 mimic, the miR-1271 inhibitor, or small interfering RNA against CCNA1. The HBV-DNA quantitative assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromid assay, scratch test, transwell assay, and flow cytometry were used to detect HBV-DNA replication, cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis. MiR-1271 showed a low expression, whereas CCNA1 showed a high expression in HBV-associated HCC tissues. We identified that miR-1271 targeted and negatively regulated CCNA1. Upregulated miR-1271 and downregulated CCNA1 inhibited the HBV-associated HCC cell HBV-DNA replication, proliferation, migration, and invasion, while accelerating apoptosis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway. MiR-1271 promotes the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway by binding to CCNA1, whereby miR-1271 suppresses HBV-associated HCC progression. This study points to a potential therapeutic approach of downregulation of miR-1271 in HBV-associated HCC treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In the current study, mucilage composite films were produced by incorporating the cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) at different concentrations i.e.,3 and 6% to chia mucilage matrix by solution casting method. To evaluate the effect of CNF incorporation into mucilage matrix, the obtained composite films were characterized extensively using both physicochemical and biological tools. FT-IR spectra confirmed the composite formation by broader –OH bond peaks than in the spectrum of mucilage control film and shift of C[dbnd]O stretching vibration peak lower wave number and widen in the mucilage films including cellulose nanofibers. Cellulose nanofibers did not reveal a significant effect on the thermal properties of the all three composite films and dynamic thermogravimetric values were recorded as ≃287 °C. Atomic force microscopy revealed a homogenous distribution of cellulose nanofibers across the mucilage matrix. Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed that the inclusion of cellulose nanofibers in mucilage film led to an enhancement of the tensile modulus as well as the tensile strength, but without reducing the strain at break of the film. Cellulose nanofibers incorporation significantly enhanced the hydrophobic properties of the composite films. The cytotoxicity assay results demonstrated mucilage composite films were nontoxic and have anticancer properties; reducing the viability of cancer cell line by ≃ 20% and retaining the cell viability of epithelial cell line by ≃ 90%. Cellulose nanofibers incorporation also significantly enhanced the antioxidant and antimicrobial attributes of the mucilage composite films. Overall, the current study provided an idea regarding the biocompatible, non-toxic, highly antioxidative and antimicrobial biodegradable nature of mucilage-CNF composite films, making it a suitable candidate for food and pharmaceutical industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a photoactive material, Graphdiyne (GDY) loaded with AuNPs (AuNPs-GDY), was successfully synthesized. The fabricated material made use of the natural band-gap structure of GDY, which could produce hole-electron pairs and the plasmon resonance effect of AuNPs to obtain a high photoelectrochemical (PEC) response. AuNPs-GDY PEC response changed with the mass ratio of GDY to tetrachloroauric acid. When the mass ratio of GDY to tetrachloroauric acid was 1:2.5, AuNPs-GDY exhibited the best PEC performance. Thus, the best one was selected as the photoactive material to establish a PEC biosensor for microRNA detection. The PEC biosensor used the alkaline phosphatases as catalyzer to generate ascorbic acid in situ, which provided a low background signal and a high PEC response. The cancer marker, MicroRNA let-7a, was chosen as a target model. Under optimal condition, potential 300 mV and pH 8.0, the PEC biosensor had a detection limit of 3.3 × 10 –19 M and a good linearity with microRNA let-7a concentration ranged from 1.0 × 10 –18 M to 1.0 × 10 −10 M. This PEC biosensor opened a promising platform using GDY to fabricate analytical method and detect microRNA at ultralow levels for diagnoses. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "To achieve precise control of nano-carrier structure and drug release behavior, we designed a pH/redox dual-responsive polymeric prodrug by condensation polymerization using octahedrally coordinated cisplatin (Pt IV) and ortho ester monomer. The prodrug was then self-assembled with doxorubicin (DOX) in aqueous solution to give a synergetic drug delivery system. The polymer backbone can completely degrade and release cisplatin (Pt II) and DOX under the acidic and reductive environment of tumor cells, owing to the breakage of ortho ester bonds and the reduction of Pt (IV). The size and micromorphology of micelles were observed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In vitro study of drug release, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity revealed that the micelles could be triggered intracellularly to release two drugs. In vivo drug distribution and antitumor activity also provide the evidence for the excellent antitumor effect of micelles. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: In this study, we aimed to determine the usefulness of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) as a noninvasive method for the evaluation of tumor invasion depth, histological grade, and lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrial carcinoma (EMC). Materials and methods: Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived informed consent. In total, 24 patients suspected of having EMC were examined by a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging. DKI data were obtained using a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence with four b values (0, 500, 1000, and 2000 s/mm2). Kurtosis (K), diffusivity (D), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were generated and compared with histopathological findings. Results: K maps from all patients identified the junctional zone as a distinct high-K zone (1.443 ± 0.362). This zone was significantly different from the zone of endometrium and outer myometrium (0.678 ± 0.179 and 0.694 ± 0.113, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). K and D values of all EMCs were significantly different from those of all normal uterine wall layers. K and D values were significantly correlated with histological grades of endometrioid adenocarcinomas (r = 0.799, P &lt; 0.001 and r = −0.799, P &lt; 0.001, respectively), while ADC values were not (r = −0.243, P = 0.382). Metastatic and nonmetastatic lymph nodes showed significantly different K (P = 0.001) and D (P = 0.001) values, but not ADC values (P = 0.827). Conclusions: DKI may be clinically useful for the noninvasive evaluation of depth of tumor invasion, histological grade, and lymph node metastasis in patients with EMC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "As a key regulator of DNA translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway, RAD18 is reported to be abnormally expressed in many kinds of cancers. In glioma, RAD18 was overexpressed in the primary and recurrent glioblastoma multiforme specimens, and its overexpression weakened ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in glioma A172 cells. Moreover, A172 cells with mutational P53 also showed enhanced radiation resistance. And RAD18 activation induced by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) was repressed by P53. However, whether P53 involves in RAD18-induced radiation resistance remains unknown. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the effects and mechanism of RAD18 in the radiation resistance of glioma and study P53 role in this process. Results showed that, RAD18 expression was obviously elevated in glioma tissues and cell lines such as U251, SHG-44, A172, U-87 MG and U-118 MG as compared with the normal brain tissues and neuroglia cells. Up-regulation of RAD18 in U-118 MG and A172 cells with lentivirus infection significantly increased cell growth and inhibited cell apoptosis, determined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry technologies. Besides, RAD18 overexpression enhanced cell growth and inhibited cell apoptosis after U-118 MG or A172 cells were irradiated at a dose of 4 Gy. On the contrary, silencing of endogenous RAD18 sensitized U-118 MG and A172 cells to radiation. Moreover, RAD18 and P53 proteins were co-located in the nucleus, and up-regulation of RAD18 decreased the expression of P53 protein and facilitated its nuclear export. Furthermore, cell growth promotion and cell apoptosis inhibition induced by RAD18 up-regulation were impaired when P53 expression was up-regulated under radiation condition. In a word, this study clarifies that RAD18 functions as a promoter in glioma progression and reduces glioma cells’ sensibility to radiation through down-regulating P53, which provides new strategies to overcome the radiation resistance in glioma. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Living species are chronically exposed to environmental ionizing radiations from sources that can be overexpressed by nuclear accidents. In invertebrates, reproduction is the most radiosensitive studied endpoint, likely to be connected with aging. Surprisingly, aging is a sparsely investigated endpoint after chronic ionizing radiation, whereas understanding it is of fundamental interest in biology and medicine. Indeed, aging and aging-related diseases (e.g., cancer and degenerative diseases) cause about 90% of deaths in developed countries. Therefore, glp-1 sterile Caenorhabditis elegans nematode was used to assess the impact of chronic gamma irradiation on the lifespan. Analyses were performed, at the individual level, on aging and, in order to delve deeper into the mechanisms, at the molecular level, on oxidative damage (carbonylation), biomolecules (lipids, proteins and nucleic acids) and their colocalization. We observed that ionizing radiation accelerates aging (whatever the duration (3–19 days)/dose (0.5–24 Gy)/dose rate (7 and 52 mGy h −1 ) tested) leading to a longevity value equivalent to that of wt nematode (∼25–30 days). Moreover, the level of protein oxidative damage (carbonylation) turned out to be good cellular biomarker of aging, since it increases with age. Conversely, chronic radiation treatments reduced carbonylation levels and induced neutral lipid catabolism whatever the dose rate and the final delivered dose. Finally, under some conditions a lipid-protein colocalization without any carbonyl was observed; this could be linked to yolk accumulation in glp-1 nematodes. To conclude, we noticed through this study a link between chronic gamma exposure, lifespan shortening and lipid level decrease associated with a decrease in the overall carbonylation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: We aimed to present the first clinical results for adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the nasopharynx after primary radiotherapy (RT) with the focus on local control (LC) and patterns of recurrence. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 59 patients with ACC of the nasopharynx, who were treated with bimodal radiotherapy (RT) consisting of intensity modulated radiotherapy and carbon ion boost at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center between 2009 and 2018. The patients had predominantly inoperable (n = 42, 72%) or incompletely resected (n = 17, 29%) tumors. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The median follow-up was 32 months. At last follow-up, 67% of the patients were still alive (n = 39/58), of whom 74% were free of progression (n = 29/39). The 2-year LC, distant progression-free survival (DPFS) and overall survival (OS) were 83%, 81%, 87% and the estimated 5-year LC, DPFS and OS were 49%, 54%, 69%, respectively. LC was significantly inferior in patients with large tumor volumes (gross tumor volume, GTV > 100 cc, p = 0.020) and T4 tumors (p = 0.021). The majority of the recurrences occurred at the margin, where critical structures were spared (n = 11/19, 58%). Overall, grade 3 toxicity was moderate with 12% acute and 8% late side effects. Conclusion: Bimodal RT including active raster-scanning carbon ion boost for nasopharyngeal ACC resulted in adequate LC and OS rates with moderate toxicity. T4 stage, large tumor volume and the necessary dose sparing in critical structures, i.e. optic nerves, brain stem and orbit, negatively affected LC. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, endomicroscopy has become increasingly used for diagnostic purposes and interventional guidance. It can provide intraoperative aids for real-time tissue characterization and can help to perform visual investigations aimed for example to discover epithelial cancers. Due to physical constraints on the acquisition process, endomicroscopy images, still today have a low number of informative pixels which hampers their quality. Post-processing techniques, such as Super-Resolution (SR), are a potential solution to increase the quality of these images. SR techniques are often supervised, requiring aligned pairs of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images patches to train a model. However, in our domain, the lack of HR images hinders the collection of such pairs and makes supervised training unsuitable. For this reason, we propose an unsupervised SR framework based on an adversarial deep neural network with a physically-inspired cycle consistency, designed to impose some acquisition properties on the super-resolved images. Our framework can exploit HR images, regardless of the domain where they are coming from, to transfer the quality of the HR images to the initial LR images. This property can be particularly useful in all situations where pairs of LR/HR are not available during the training. Our quantitative analysis, validated using a database of 238 endomicroscopy video sequences from 143 patients, shows the ability of the pipeline to produce convincing super-resolved images.

    "Abstract": "Malignant glioma is a severe type of brain tumor with a grim prognosis. The occurrence of resistance compromises the efficacy of chemotherapy for glioma. Long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) has recently become an attractive target for cancer therapy by regulating cell growth, invasion, and migration. Nevertheless, its role in glioma chemoresistance remains elusive. In the current study, the expression of GAS5 was decreased in glioma cell lines, and lower levels of GAS5 were observed in U138 and LN18 glioma cells that had low sensitivity to cisplatin. Functional assay confirmed that knockdown of GAS5 enhanced cell resistance to cisplatin in U87 cells, which had a relatively high expression of GAS5. Conversely, elevation of GAS5 increased cell sensitivity to cisplatin in U138 cells that had a relatively low expression of GAS5. Mechanistically, cisplatin exposure evoked excessive autophagy concomitant with an increase in autophagy-related LC3II expression and a decrease in autophagy substrate p62 expression, which was reversely muted after GAS5 overexpression. In addition, GAS5 restored cisplatin-inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. Preconditioning with mTOR antagonist rapamycin engendered not only mTOR inhibition but also abrogated GAS5-mediated depression in cisplatin-evoked autophagy. Notably, blocking the mTOR pathway also attenuated GAS5-increased sensitivity to cisplatin in U138 cells. Cumulatively, these findings indicate that GAS5 may blunt the resistance of glioma cells to cisplatin by suppressing excessive autophagy through the activation of mTOR signaling, implying a promising therapeutic strategy against chemoresistance in glioma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA-32 (miR-32) functioned as a tumor oncogene in some cancer, which control genes involved in important biological and pathological functions and facilitate the tumor growth and metastasis. However, the role of miR-32 modulates esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) malignant transformation has not been clarified. Here, we focused on the function and the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-32 in ESCC. Results discovered a significant increased expression of miR-32 in ESCC tissues and cells. Downregulation of miR-32 inhibited the migration, invasion, adhesion of ESCC cell lines (EC9706 and KYSE450), and the levels of EMT protein in vitro. In vivo, miR-32 inhibitors decrease tumor size, tumor weight, and the number of metastatic nodules. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) results revealed that inhibition of miR-32 attenuate lung metastasis. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assay showed increased level of E-cadherin and decreased level of N-cadherin and Vimentin with treatment of miR-32 inhibitors. Furthermore, miR-32 targeted the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of CXXC5, and inhibited the level of mRNA and protein of CXXC5. There is a negative correlation between the expressions of CXXC5 and miR-32. Then, after EC9706 and KYSE450 cells cotransfected with si-CXXC5 and miR-32 inhibitors, the ability of cell migration, invasion, and adhesion was significantly reduced. In addition, the protein expression of EMT and TGF-β signaling was also depressed. Collectively, these data supply an insight into the positive role of miR-32 in ESCC progression and metastasis, and its biological effects may attribute the inhibition of TGF-β signaling mediated by CXXC5. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "We evaluated the effect of bisphenol A and its metabolites on the 3T3-L1 cells, in terms of glucose and lipid metabolism. We also aimed to obtain the information on the genome-wide expression changes in the 3T3-L1 cells treated with Bisphenol A by using RNA-seq, which involves whole-transcriptome sequencing. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) collected from RNA-seq can be used to produce a complete picture of related metabolism pathways. The KEGG pathway was extracted based on the DEGs. Bisphenol A significantly increased the mRNA level of Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (Cebpa). Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) was also significantly influenced by bisphenol A and its metabolites. Acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase beta (Acacb) and Fatty acid synthase (Fasn) mRNA levels were elevated by bisphenol A and its metabolites. The insulin signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and endometrial cancer-related pathway were focused by the functional enrichment analyses, and the pathways were well coincided with recent previous reports. DEGs collected from RNA-seq were confirmed as a reliable evidence in the exposure to the chemicals such as bisphenol A. Collecting pieces of the puzzles obtained from the RNA-seq will help us to produce a complete picture of the metabolic pathway for such chemicals. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a conversant joint disease, which seriously threatens the health of the elderly, and even leads to disability. Long non-coding RNA-activated by transforming growth factor beta (lncRNA-ATB) has been reported in diverse cancers. However, the functions of lncRNA-ATB in OA remain uninvestigated. The current study aimed to explore the impacts of lncRNA-ATB on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells and to uncover the underlying mechanism. LPS-induced ATDC5 cell injury model was constructed, and the effects of lncRNA-ATB on LPS-injured cells were explored via analyzing cell viability, apoptosis, iNOS, COX-2, and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). Subsequently, the relationship between lncRNA-ATB and microRNA (miR)-223 was detected, and whether miR-223 was involved in modulating LPS-induced cells injury in ATDC5 cells was investigated. Finally, MyD88/NF-κB and p38MAPK pathways were assessed to explore the underlying mechanism. Results showed that LPS repressed cell viability, induced apoptosis, and promoted iNOS, COX-2, IL-6 and TNF-α expression. Additionally, we observed that lncRNA-ATB expression was down-regulated in LPS-injured cells, and lncRNA-ATB overexpression significantly alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells. Interesting results revealed that miR-223 expression was down-regulated by lncRNA-ATB and miR-223 overexpression declined the protective effect of lncRNA-ATB on LPS-injured ATDC5 cells. Further, the signaling pathway experiments showed that lncRNA-ATB inhibited MyD88/NF-κB and p38MAPK pathways by down-regulating miR-223 in LPS-injured cells. These data demonstrated that lncRNA-ATB protected ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced inflammatory injury by repressing MyD88/NF-κB and p38MAPK pathways, which was mediated by down-regulation of miR-223. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Elemental carbon nanomaterials (ECNMs) are redox active agents that can be exploited to purposely modify the redox balance of cells. Both pro- or antioxidant properties have been reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are not comprehensive studies exploring both properties on the same material in view of a potential application in medicine. At the same time, the effect of the bulk structure on the pro/antioxidant properties is poorly known. Here, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) derived by glucose with definite size and shape have been prepared, and their redox properties evaluated in cell free systems in the dark or following activation with a Near Infrared (NIR) laser beam (945 nm, 1.3 W/cm 2 ). We found that, when irradiated with NIR, CNPs efficiently generate heat and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), a property that can be exploited for dual photo-thermal (PT)/photodynamic (PD) therapy in cancer. On the other hand, in the absence of photo-activation, CNPs react with both oxidant (hydroxyl radicals) and antioxidant (glutathione) species. When tested on a murine macrophages cell line (RAW 264.7) CNPs were clearly antioxidant. Furthermore, albeit efficiently internalized, CNPs do not exert cytotoxic effect up to 80 µg/ml and do not exacerbate TNF-α-mediated inflammation. Overall, the results reported herein suggest that CNPs may represent a new class of safe nanomaterials with potential applications in medicine. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer. Recent studies reported that Tescalcin was overexpressed in various tumor types. However, the status of Tescalcin protein expression in RCC and its biological function is uncertain. This study was designed to investigate the expression of Tescalcin in human RCC and its biological function. Methods: shRNA transfection was performed to abrogates the expression of Tescalcin. Quantitative real time PCR and western blotting assays were used to determine mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. The cell viability was analyzed by MTT and colony formation. Cell flow cytometry was used to assess pHi value and cell apoptosis. Cell invasive and migratory ability was measured with modified Boyden chamber assay. Xenograft model was setup to evaluate tumor growth. Results: Tescalcin was overexpressed in RCC tissues compared with matched normal tissues. It was also overexpressed in RCC cell lines relative that of normal cells. Suppression Tescalcin with specific shRNA resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of RCC cells. Additionally, silencing of Tescalcin also caused the inhibition of the tumor growth in nude mice. Mechanistic study showed that Tescalcin regulated cell proliferation, migration and invasion via NHE1/pHi axis as well as AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that atopic expression of Tescalcin facilitates the survival, migration and invasion of RCC cells via NHE1/pHi axis as well as AKT/ NF-κB signaling pathway, providing new perspectives for the future study of Tescalcin as a therapeutic target for RCC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Drug traversal across the blood-brain barrier has come under increasing scrutiny recently, particularly concerning the treatment of sicknesses, such as brain cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Most therapies and medicines are limited due to their inability to cross this barrier, reducing treatment options for maladies affecting the brain. Carbon dots show promise as drug carriers, but they experience the same limitations regarding crossing the blood-brain barrier as many small molecules do. If carbon dots can be prepared from a precursor that can cross the blood-brain barrier, there is a chance that the remaining original precursor molecule can attach to the carbon dot surface and lead the system into the brain. Herein, tryptophan carbon dots were synthesized with the strategy of using tryptophan as an amino acid for crossing the blood-brain barrier via LAT1 transporter-mediated endocytosis. Two types of carbon dots were synthesized using tryptophan and two different nitrogen dopants: urea and 1,2-ethylenediamine. Carbon dots made using these precursors show excitation wavelength-dependent emission, low toxicity, and have been observed inside the central nervous system of zebrafish (Danio rerio). The proposed mechanism for these carbon dots abilities to cross the blood-brain barrier concerns residual tryptophan molecules which attach to the carbon dots surface, enabling them to be recognized by the LAT1 transporter. The role of carbon dots for transport open promising avenues for drug delivery and imaging in the brain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the most common cancers, and its carcinogenesis and progression is influenced by multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), especially through the miRNA sponge effect. In this study, more than 4000 lncRNAs were re-annotated from the microarray datasets through probe sequence mapping to obtain reliable lncRNA expression profiles. As a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify lncRNA modules associated with the five stepwise stages from normal colonic samples to COAD (n = 94). In the most relevant module (R 2 = −0.78, P = 4E-20), four hub lncRNAs were identified (CTD-2396E7.11, PCGF5, RP11-33O4.1, and RP11-164P12.5). Then, these four hub lncRNAs were validated using two other independent datasets including GSE20916 (n = 145) and GSE39582 (n = 552). The results indicated that all hub lncRNAs were significantly negatively correlated with the three-stage colonic carcinogenesis, as well as TNM stages in COAD (one-way analysis of variance P &lt; 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients with higher expression of each hub lncRNA had a significantly higher overall survival rate and lower relapse risk (log-rank P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, through co-expression analysis, we identified and validated four key lncRNAs in association with the carcinogenesis and progression of COAD, and these lncRNAs might have important clinical implications for improving the risk stratification, therapeutic decision and prognosis prediction in COAD patients. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previous studies have reported that around 50% of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) has undergone recent hospitalization. However, studies on the impact of hospitalization as a trigger factor for VTE are limited. Objectives: To investigate the impact of hospitalization with and without concurrent immobilization as a trigger factor for VTE. Methods: We conducted a case-crossover study of 530 cancer-free VTE patients. Hospitalizations were registered during the 90-day period preceding the VTE diagnosis (hazard period), and in four preceding 90-day control periods. A 90-day washout period between the control- and hazard periods was implemented to avoid potential carry-over effects. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) of VTE according to hospitalization. Results: In total, 159 (30%) of the VTE-patients had been hospitalized in the hazard period, and the OR of hospitalization was 9.4 (95% CI: 6.8–12.8). The risk increased slightly with the total number of days spent in hospital (OR per day: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04–1.18), and with the number of hospitalizations (OR 8.9, 95% CI: 6.4–12.4 for 1 hospitalization and OR 12.3, 95% CI 6.4–23.6 for ≥2 hospitalizations). Hospitalization without immobilization was 6-times (OR: 6.3, 95% CI: 4.4–9.2) more common, whereas hospitalization with immobilization was near 20-times (OR: 19.8, 95% CI: 11.5–34.0) more common in the 90-days prior to a VTE compared to the control periods. Conclusions: Hospitalization is a major trigger factor for VTE also in the absence of immobilization. However, immobilization contributes substantially to the risk of VTE among hospitalized patients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "In our previous study, a novel cold-water-soluble polysaccharide (APS4) was isolated from Astragalus membranaceus. This study aimed to evaluate the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis-induced effects of APS4 on human gastric carcinoma MGC-803 cells and to investigate its potential molecular mechanism. It was found that APS4 could significantly suppress the proliferation of MGC-803 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Morphologic observations and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining showed that APS4-treated MGC-803 cells exhibited typical morphological characteristics of apoptosis. Cell cycle detection revealed that APS4 could arrest MGC-803 cells in S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, APS4 treatment could induce the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, which was closely related to the accumulation of intracellular ROS, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, the increase of the pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic (Bax/Bcl-2) ratios, the release of cytochrome c, further activating the expression of caspase-9/-3 and the cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) in MGC-803 cells. Taken together, our results suggested that APS4 had observable apoptosis-induced effects on MGC-803 cells via arresting the cell cycle in S phase and inducing the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease and related disorders (PDRD) and their families have considerable unmet needs including non-motor symptom management, caregiver support, spiritual wellbeing, advance care planning, and end-of-life care. There is increasing interest in applying palliative care (PC) models to better meet these needs. While PC has been shown to improve care and quality of life (QOL) for people with cancer and heart failure, few studies have evaluated the role of PC for people with PDRD. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to optimize the PC approach for PDRD and to influence policy and implementation efforts. We initiated a randomized multicenter comparative effectiveness trial of team-based outpatient PC versus usual care for people with PDRD and their caregivers. The primary aims of this study are to determine the effects of PC on patient QOL and caregiver burden. Qualitative interviews will be utilized to gain additional insights into the impact of PC on participants, the outcomes that matter most to this population, and to find opportunities to refine future interventions and trials. As a novel application of PC, challenges involved in the design of this study include choosing appropriate inclusion criteria, standardizing the intervention, defining usual care, and choosing outcome measures suitable to our research questions. Challenges involved in implementation include participant recruitment, retention, and management of participant burden. We anticipate the results of this trial will have relevance for both clinical care and future clinical research trial design in evaluating models of PC for people with PDRD and other serious illnesses. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to understand the effects and long-term survival of 1st generation epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors(EGFR-TKI)or platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. Patients and Methods: Specimens from 4276 advanced (IIIB/IV) patients were diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and underwent EGFR gene detection at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The clinic characteristics, survival outcomes data, treatment outcomes and data of subsequent therapies after first-line treatment were collected of patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. The results were compared with common EGFR mutations. Results: For patients with uncommon EGFR mutations, EGFR-TKIs or platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy, showed no difference in objective response rate (ORR 33% vs 27.1% P = 0.499) and disease control rate (DCR 76.5% vs 87.5%, P = 0.194). EGFR-TKIs showed a superior progression-free survival than chemotherapy (median PFS, 7.2 vs 4.9 mt, HR = 0.604; P = 0.0088). Interestingly, compared with chemotherapy, we found that overall survival (median OS, 14.3 vs 20.7 mts, HR = 1.759; P = 0.0336) was significantly worse in patients with EGFR-TKIs. Multivariate analysis showed that extra metastases (HR = 2.240, P = 0.001) and smoking history (HR = 2.048, P = 0.013) were independent prognostic factors for OS in lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR uncommon mutations. Conclusions: Compared with chemotherapy, use of the 1st generation of EGFR-TKIs as first-line therapy can improve the short-term efficacy of patients with EGFR uncommon mutations advanced lung adenocarcinoma, but platinum-based chemotherapy showed a longer overall survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The p53, p63 and p73 proteins belong to the p53 family of transcription factors, playing key roles in tumour suppression. The α-splice variant of p73 (p73α) has at its C terminus a sterile alpha motif (SAM); this domain, SAMp73, formed by five helices (α1 to α5), is thought to mediate in protein-protein interactions. The E3-ligase MDM2 binds to p73 at its N terminus transactivation domain (TA), but it does not promote its degradation via ubiquitination; however, the details of such MDM2/p73 interaction are not fully known. Methods: We studied the binding of SAMp73 with N-terminal MDM2, by several biophysical techniques, namely, fluorescence, far-UV circular dichroism (CD), NMR and bio-layer interferometry (BLI). Results: Our results obtained by fluorescence, T 2 -relaxation measurements and BLI show that there was binding between both proteins with a dissociation constant of ~10 μM. Furthermore, the binding region of SAMp73 involved mainly residues in the major α-helix, α5, and the nearby α4, as shown by HSQC-NMR. The binding was so specific that an isolated peptide comprising α4 and α5 helices of SAMp73, α4α5, did also bind to the N terminus of MDM2, although with weaker affinity than the entire domain. Conclusions: A new interaction between MDM2 and SAMp73 has been found, which could have potential therapeutic applications in cancers involving inactivated p53. General significance: A novel interaction between the C-terminal SAM of p73 and N-terminal MDM2 is described. The interaction could be used to modulate the functions where the wild-type, intact p73 is involved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Development of efficient non-viral carriers is one of the major challenges of gene delivery. In the current study, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated the in vitro gene delivery efficiency of novel amphiphilic constructs composed of cholesterol and low molecular weight protamine (LMWP: VSRRRRRRGGRRRR) peptide. Vectors having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties were evaluated in terms of particle size and charge, DNA condensation ability, cytotoxicity, and gene transfection efficiency. The prepared vectors spontaneity self-assembled into the liposome-like particles with a high local positive density. The nano-vehicle A (H5-LMWP-Cholestrol) and nano-vehicle B (LMWP-Cholesterol) could form micelles at concentrations above 50 μg/mL and 65 μg/mL, respectively. The gel retardation assay showed that nano-vehicles A and B could condense pDNA more efficiently than the corresponding unconjugated peptides. The mean of size and zeta potential of complexed nano-vehicle A at N/P ratios of 5, 15, and 30 were 151 nm and 23 mv, and those of nano-vehicle B were 224 nm and 19 mv, respectively. In terms of transfection efficiency, the designed nano-vehicles showed almost two-fold higher gene expression level compared to PEI 25 kDa at optimal N/P ratios, and also exhibited negligible cytotoxicity on a model cancer cell, Neuro 2a. The findings of the present study revealed that these cationic micelles can be promising candidates as non-viral gene delivery vehicles. © 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.",

    "Abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common malignant epithelial tumors in dogs and cats and shows also a high incidence in human population. Chemical and physical carcinogens as well as viral infections have been shown to predispose epithelial cells to genetic cell damage, leading to formation of neoplastic precursor cells or promoting tumor proliferation. A number of herpetological cases are documented in literature, most of these being solitary tumors with rare tendency of metastasis. Our study describes 7 cases of multicentric epidermal squamous cell tumors in male panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis). Two of these cases, which were examined by necropsy with the owners’ consent, showed distant metastasis into the lungs. In order to elucidate the etiology of these cases the submitted tissues were scanned by transmission electron microscopy for the detection of viral particles. No viral particles were visible ultrastructurally. Pan-papilloma-, irido-, rana-, adeno- and herpesvirus-PCRs (polymerase chain reaction) were performed on all of the tissues but could not demonstrate corresponding virus-specific sequences. Universal PCRs for para- and orthopox viruses applied on one sample also yielded negative results. Three different therapeutical approaches namely surgical excision, cryosurgery, and the use of a topical immune response modifying cream Imiquimod, are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The long noncoding RNA MNX1-AS1 has been reported to facilitate the progression of glioblastoma and ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, the biological roles and underlying mechanisms of MNX1-AS1 in colon adenocarcinoma have not been studied until now. In the current study, MNX1-AS1 was upregulated in colon adenocarcinoma. JASPAR prediction tool showed that E2F1 could bind to the promoter region of MNX1-AS1. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and luciferase reporter assay were used to verify the interactions between MNX1-AS1 and E2F1. Then functional assays revealed that downregulation of MNX1-AS1 decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in colon adenocarcinoma, but upregulation of E2F1 reversed the effects. Moreover, subcellular fractionation assay manifested that MNX1-AS1 was enriched in the cytoplasm of colon adenocarcinoma cells, thus we speculated whether MNX1-AS1 could function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to play roles in colon adenocarcinoma. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay indicated that MNX1-AS1 could sponge microRNA-218-5p (miR-218-5p). Furthermore, we discovered that SEC61A1 was downstream target of miR-218-5p, and MNX1-AS1 acted as a ceRNA to upregulate the expression of SEC61A1 through sponging miR-218-5p. Finally, rescue assays confirmed that MNX1-AS1 facilitated the progression of colon adenocarcinoma through regulating miR-218-5p/SEC61A1 axis. Taken together, we concluded that E2F1-mediated MNX1-AS1-miR-218-5p-SEC61A1 feedback loop contributed to the progression of colon adenocarcinoma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This preclinical study investigated the use of QSM MRI to noninvasively measure venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) in the hepatic and portal veins. Methods: QSM data were acquired from a cohort of healthy mice (n = 10) on a 9.4 Tesla MRI scanner under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Susceptibility was measured in the portal and hepatic veins and used to calculate SvO2 in each vessel under each condition. Blood was extracted from the inferior vena cava of 3 of the mice under each condition, and SvO2 was measured with a blood gas analyzer for comparison. QSM data were also acquired from a cohort of mice bearing liver tumors under normoxic conditions. Susceptibility was measured, and SvO2 calculated in the portal and hepatic veins and compared to the healthy mice. Statistical significance was assessed using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (normoxic vs. hyperoxic) or a Mann-Whitney test (healthy vs. tumor bearing). Results: SvO2 calculated from QSM measurements in healthy mice under hyperoxia showed significant increases of 15% in the portal vein (P < 0.05) and 21% in the hepatic vein (P < 0.01) versus normoxia. These values agreed with inferior vena cava measurements from the blood gas analyzer (26% increase). SvO2 in the hepatic vein was significantly lower in the colorectal liver metastases cohort (30% ± 11%) than the healthy mice (53% ± 17%) (P < 0.05); differences in the portal vein were not significant. Conclusion: QSM is a feasible tool for noninvasively measuring SvO2 in the liver and can detect differences due to increased oxygen consumption in livers bearing colorectal metastases. © 2018 The Authors Magnetic Resonance in Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",

    "Abstract": "Background: Antithrombin (AT) is not only a major regulator of hemostasis, but it shows anti-inflammatory properties as well. We aimed to investigate whether AT-insufficient mice increase susceptibility to liver tumorigenesis. Methods: We induced the development of liver tumor in AT-insufficient (AT +/− ) mice and wild-type (AT +/+ ) mice by treating them with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and CCl 4 . The development of liver tumors and liver inflammation were compared between these mouse groups. Following this, AT was administered to the AT-insufficient mice treated with DEN and CCl 4 . Results: Tumor size and the number of DEN and CCl 4 -induced liver tumors significantly increased in AT-insufficient mice compared with the wild-type mice. Serum transaminase levels, cell death, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in liver were increased in AT +/− . Furthermore, hepatic neutrophil infiltrations and serum interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α levels were significantly elevated in AT-insufficient mice. The levels of 8-OHdG, oxidative DNA damage marker, in liver were significantly increased in AT-insufficient mice. Administration of AT led to a significant decrease in DEN- and CCl 4 -induced liver injury and inflammation in AT-insufficient mice, compared with the wild-type group. Conclusions: AT insufficiency led to increased susceptibility to liver tumorigenesis by increasing hepatic inflammation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been recognized as a tumor oncogene involved in the development of multiple cancers. However, the function of NEAT1 and its molecular mechanism in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unclear. First, we detected the NEAT1 expression in OS cell lines by performing quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Next, the effects of NEAT1 on OS cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were tested by lentivirus-mediated downregulation. We observed that inhibition of NEAT1 restrained OS cell progression greatly. Interestingly, in the last few years, increasing studies have shown that some lncRNAs can act as miRNA sponges and reduce the amount of the same. Here, we found that NEAT1 can modulate OS development via sponging miR-339-5p. MiR-339-5p was significantly decreased in OS cells, and its overexpression can remarkably repress the OS proliferation. These results indicated that NEAT1 could function as a tumor oncogene in OS by inhibiting miR-339-5p in vitro. Then, the following assays validated that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) can act as a functional target of miR-339-5p in OS cells. Finally, we indicated that NEAT1 could mediate TGF-β1 expression by competitively sponging miR-339-5p. NEAT1 induced OS cell proliferation and cell mobility by binding to miR-339-5p and increasing TGF-β1 in OS. It was demonstrated in our study that lncRNA NEAT1 could impede miR-339-5p expression to maintain the expression of TGF-β1, which led to the development of OS. Our findings implied that the novel identified NEAT1/miR-339-5p/TGF-β1 axis might be a new molecular pathway or therapeutic target for OS diagnosis and treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Two transition metal complexes of [M(TMP) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] (TMP-Cu, M = Cu; TMP-Co, M = Co) with (E)-2-(((4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)imino)methyl)-6-methoxyphenol (H-TMP) were first synthesized and characterized by infrared analysis, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Notably, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay showed that TMP-Cu displayed relatively high cytotoxic activity against Hep-G2 cancer cells, and high selectivity between human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and normal HL-7702 cells, in comparison to TMP-Co and cisplatin. Further studies showed that TMP-Cu and TMP-Co caused cell cycle arrest at S phase through regulation of S phase related protein expressions and induced Hep-G2 cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the potential function of FER1L4 in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and uncover its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods: In the current study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to determine the expression profile of FER1L4 in normal liver tissues and hepatocellular carcinoma tissues of human, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines including HL-7702[L-02], HepG-2, Hep3b, and SMMC-7721. Then, HepG-2 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-FER1L4 (pcDNA3.1-empty as negative control) for gain-of-function analysis, followed with cell functional abnormality tests. Specifically, colony formation analysis and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide experiment were taken advantage to measure the cell proliferation, while cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell experiment respectively. Additionally, cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Moreover, the effect of FER1L4 on PI3K/AKT signal pathway activation was investigated through analyzing phosphorylation of related proteins, p-AKT/AKT and p-PI3K/PI3K, via Western blot assay. Results: Downregulation of FER1L4 in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cells was demonstrated by qRT-PCR analysis. Besides, FER1L4 overexpression evidently attenuated the cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but prompted cell apoptosis. Importantly, Western blot assays revealed that PII3K/AKT signal pathway were involved in mediating the progression regulation role of FER1L4 in HCC cells. Conclusions: Our study suggested that FER1L4 might alleviate progression of hepatocellular carcinoma via blocking PI3K/AKT pathway, which encourages a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HCC and may provide a novel potential therapeutic target for clinical treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "GLUT12 was cloned from the mammary cancer cell line MCF-7, but its physiological role still needs to be elucidated. To gain more knowledge of GLUT12 function in the intestine, we investigated GLUT12 subcellular localization in the small intestine and its regulation by sugars, hormones, and intracellular mediators in Caco-2 cells and mice. Immunohistochemical methods were used to determine GLUT12 subcellular localization in human and murine small intestine. Brush border membrane vesicles were isolated for western blot analyses. Functional studies were performed in Caco-2 cells by measuring α-methyl-d-glucose (αMG) uptake in the absence of sodium. GLUT12 is located in the apical cytoplasm, below the brush border membrane, and in the perinuclear region of murine and human enterocytes. In Caco-2 cells, GLUT12 translocation to the apical membrane and α-methyl- d-glucose uptake by the transporter are stimulated by protons, glucose, insulin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), protein kinase C, and AMP-activated protein kinase. In contrast, hypoxia decreases GLUT12 expression in the apical membrane. Upregulation of TNF-α and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) genes is found in the jejunal mucosa of diet-induced obese mice. In these animals, GLUT12 expression in the brush border membrane is slightly decreased compared with lean animals. Moreover, an intraperitoneal injection of insulin does not induce GLUT12 translocation to the membrane, as it occurs in lean animals. GLUT12 rapid translocation to the enterocytes’ apical membrane in response to glucose and insulin could be related to GLUT12 participation in sugar absorption during postprandial periods. In obesity, in which insulin sensitivity is reduced, the contribution of GLUT12 to sugar absorption is affected. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a long-term consequence of chronic inflammatory liver injury. Hepatic injury is associated with a defective intestinal barrier and increased hepatic exposure to bacterial products including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which promotes hepatocarcinogenesis. Despite its clinical significance, the molecular mediator linking chronic inflammation with HCC development remains to be clarified. In this study, we explored the significant dual functions of active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in LPS-induced angiogenesis of HCC. The in vitro effects of active STAT3 in tumor cells and endothelial cells were assessed using angiogenesis assay, ELISA, confocal assay, flow cytometry and western blot. The in vivo role of active STAT3 was assessed in xenografts model in nude mice. Here we report a novel mechanism by which LPS/STAT3 signaling promotes the angiogenesis of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. STAT3 activated by LPS increases the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by tumor cells, which not only promotes the proliferation of HCC cells but also stimulates the migration and tubulogenesis of endothelial cells through STAT3 activation and hence promotes angiogenesis in HCC. Our findings not only provide a potential mechanism by which bacterial infection enhances HCC oncogenesis through promoting the angiogenesis in liver, but also suggest that targeting STAT3 might be an effective therapeutic strategy in HCC treatment considering the dual roles of STAT3 in angiogenesis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cutaneous toxicities are the commonest side effects in patients with cancer treated using epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors such as erlotinib. For patients with such toxicities, there is a lack of safe, effective pharmacological agents. Here we established a skin toxicity model and investigated the preventive and therapeutic effect of Diallyl Trisulfide (DATS) in vivo. The mouse skin toxicities model was established through continuous administration of erlotinib for 49 days. Meanwhile, the mice in the experimental group underwent DATS treatment for 49 days. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and oil red O staining of back and limb skin was performed to determine whether DATS aqueous extract can reverse the skin toxicities caused by erlotinib. Compared with the erlotinib group, the incidence of rash in the DATS group was lower. In addition, in the DATS group, the degree of skin redness and herpes was mild, the body weight was stable, and the activity was favorable. By comparing the HE and oil red O staining results for the mouse skin, the degree of keratin hyperplasia was determined to be lower in the experimental group than in the erlotinib group, and the number of purulent neutrophils decreased. The number of follicles was relatively less. The release of TNF-α, IL-6 and other inflammatory factors was reduced by DATS. Erlotinib hydrochloride can cause severe skin toxicities, and DATS prevents skin toxicities, its mechanism may be related to DATS reduced erlotinib-induced inflammatory injury. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Evasion of immune surveillance is a significant factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) carcinogenesis. IL-6 signaling is a critical mechanism for the induction of dysfunctional immune responses. In the present study, we examined the role of IL-6 in the prognosis of HNSCC regarding the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of HNSCC patients and examined its correlation with the levels of IL-6 in tumors and circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in peripheral blood. Furthermore, the relationships between IL and 6, programmed death ligand (PD-L1) expression, and immune response were examined in vitro and in vivo. Our data revealed that IL-6 overexpression was associated with the increased risk of developing disease failure and poor prognosis for HNSCC. The immunoreactivity of IL-6 in HNSCC specimens was positively linked to the staining of PD-L1 and the level of circulating MDSCs. By cellular and animal experiments, there were augmented radiation-induced increases in the expression of PD-L1 and the activation of MDSCs noted in IL-6-positive tumors. When IL-6 signaling was inhibited, the levels of PD-L1 and MDSC recruitment were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was positively correlated with the levels of IL-6 and PD-L1 in tumor, and circulating MDSCs. In conclusion, IL-6 is a significant predictor of treatment outcome in HNSCC patients, and plays an important role in the induction of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment mediated by increased MDSCs and PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, IL-6 combined with NLR can assist the clinician to make an informed decision regarding treatment options. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In continuation with our previous report w.r.t the synthesis of phase pure and mixed phase calcium aluminum layered double hydroxide (CaAl-LDH) and its subsequent evaluation with regard to anticancer property, the present communication demonstrates the intercalation of plasmid encoded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into the interlayer space of CaAl-LDH nanoparticle (precipitated both at pHs 8.5 and 12.5, designated as sample A and B respectively) by a simple technique to obtain the requisite loading, followed by evaluation of the cellular uptake and localization. The presence of interlayer carbonate anion (CO 3 2− ) as an impurity, were quantified both in the samples A and B, using ion chromatography, of which, the later exhibited a higher value (6.10 ppm) which in turn had hindered the intercalation of the shRNA, largely. Further, the cellular uptake using colon cancer cell line (HCT 116) could be correlated, based on the above data, as, for sample A, a threefold higher value (9.34%) was found in a period of 72 h, compared to sample B (3.54%), without using any transfection reagent. This observation was corroborated using confocal imaging to understand the internalization at the cellular level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to develop a 3D MRI technique to assess lung ventilation in free-breathing and without the administration of contrast agent. Methods: A 3D-UTE sequence with a koosh ball trajectory was developed for a 3 Tesla scanner. An oversampled k-space was acquired, and the direct current signal from the k-space center was used as a navigator to sort the acquired data into 8 individual breathing phases. Gradient delays were corrected, and iterative SENSE was used to reconstruct the individual timeframes. Subsequently, the signal changes caused by motion were eliminated using a 3D image registration technique, and ventilation-weighted maps were created by analyzing the signal changes in the lung tissue. Six healthy volunteers and 1 patient with lung cancer were scanned with the new 3D-UTE and the standard 2D technique. Image quality and quantitative ventilation values were compared between both methods. Results: UTE-based self-gated noncontrast-enhanced functional lung (SENCEFUL) MRI provided a time-resolved reconstruction of the breathing motion, with a 49% increase of the SNR. Ventilation quantification for healthy subjects was in statistical agreement with 2D-SENCEFUL and the literature, with a mean value of 0.11 ± 0.08 mL/mL for the whole lung. UTE-SENCEFUL was able to visualize and quantify ventilation deficits in a patient with lung tumor that were not properly depicted by 2D-SENCEFUL.

    "Abstract": "Tumor cells experience higher chemotherapy stress under condition of elevated temperature. As a result, developing novel nanoagents that integrates chemotherapy and thermotherapy holds great promise in biomedicine. Herein, utilizing spatially confined galvanic replacement method, we fabricated a yolk-shell Au@mSiO 2 nanoframes with Au NPs and mesoporous silica as yolk and shell, respectively, to sever as an excellent drug nanocarrier with effective photothermal conversion efficiency. Taking full advantage of the high temperature response of the Au@mSiO 2 nanoframes, the phase change material 1-tetradecanol (TD) was creatively employed as gatekeepers, intelligently controlling the release of loaded agents. Then, the actively targeted Alanine-Alanine-Asparagine, legumain-recognizable oligopeptides was decorated on the surface of the prepared nanoframes. Upon exposure to near-infrared light, the GC-PtAu@mSiO 2 -TD nanoframes not only exhibited a high localized temperature response, but also triggered the quick release of loaded cargos, and thus improved the chemotherapeutic efficacy. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated the remarkable synergistic effects. Meanwhile, the laser confocal studies and flow cytometry showed the oligopeptides facilitated the intracellular uptake of GC-PtAu@mSiO 2 -TD nanoframes in MGC-803 cells. Our study highlighted the great potential of the GC-PtAu@mSiO 2 -TD nanoframes in drug delivery and the combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Rho kinases, one of the best-known members of the serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase family, can be used as target enzymes for the treatment of many diseases such as cancer or multiple sclerosis, and especially for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This study presents QSAR modeling for a series of 41 chemical compounds as Rho kinase inhibitors based on the Monte Carlo method. QSAR models were developed for three random splits into the training and test set. Molecular descriptors used for QSAR modeling were based on the SMILES notation and local invariants of the molecular graph. The statistical quality of the developed model, including robustness and predictability, was tested with different statistical approaches and satisfying results were obtained. The best calculated QSAR model had the following statistical parameters: r 2 = 0.8825 and q 2 = 0.8626 for the training set and r 2 = 0.9377 and q 2 = 0.9124 for the test set. Novel statistical metric entitled as the index of ideality of correlation was used for the final model assessment, and the obtained results were 0.6631 for the training and 0.9683 for the test set. Molecular fragments responsible for the increases and decreases of the studied activity were defined and they were further used for the computer-aided design of new compounds as potential Rho kinase inhibitors. The final assessment of the developed QSAR model and designed inhibitors was achieved with the application of molecular docking. An excellent correlation between the results from QSAR and molecular docking studies was obtained. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Novel cancer immunotherapies, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, have demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Tissue expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2) has been shown to predict tumor response to these drugs. We examine the expression of prognostic immune biomarkers, PD-L1 and PD-L2, in invasive ocular surface squamous neoplasia. Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Eighteen cases of ocular surface or ocular adnexal invasive squamous cell carcinomas were identified in pathology case files of the Massachusetts General Hospital/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and at the Wills Eye Hospital accessioned between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2017. Immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1, PD-L2, CD8, and p16 was performed and graded in a standardized fashion. Results: PD-L1 and PD-L2 were expressed on tumor cells to varying degrees, and also on some stromal cells and endothelial cells. Stromal and endothelial cell expression was also seen in control conjunctival specimens. Tumor expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 was present on the cell membranes. All 18 (100%) of the tumors expressed PD-L1: 7 (39%) expressed a high level, 3 (17%) expressed a medium level, and 8 (44%) expressed a low level. Only 9 (50%) tumors expressed PD-L2 and it was at a low level. The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells correlated with the presence of CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes among tumor cells (P < .01) and with the presence of CD8-positive cells in the surrounding stroma (P = .04). Conclusions: A subset of ocular invasive conjunctival squamous carcinomas express high levels of PD-L1 and CD8 and therefore may respond therapeutically to immune checkpoint inhibition. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A novel sampling concept for mass spectrometric bottom-up targeted protein analysis is here demonstrated with polymeric sampling spots integrated with instant immunocapture for analysis of dried matrix spots. The polymers 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-vinyl-4,4-dimethyl azlactone (pHEMA-VDM) and pHEMA-Tosyl for covalent attachment of antibodies where investigated alongside with adsorption on non-treated filter paper. From performance characterization, the pHEMA-VDM had the best performance. The sampling spots demonstrated fast and easy sampling and preparation of human serum spiked with the biomarker human chorionic gonadotropin. The sampling spots enabled a detection limit of 1 ng/mL (26.4 pM) within a five point concentration curve from 1 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL (R2 = 0.97). The detection limit was demonstrated to be two times lower than previously demonstrated with standard DMPK-C sampling cards. A five point concentration curve from 100 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL was also investigated (R2 = 0.998). Intra day precision was within 16% and 23% for concentration range 1 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL, respectively. Inter day precision was within 20%. Accuracy was determined to 10% and 11% for 2.5 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL, respectively. The sampling spots were also demonstrated in a realistic setting where serum samples from two confirmed patients with testicular germ cell cancer were analyzed. These analyses confirmed an elevated hCG content in the sera of 418.5 ± 4.2 ng/mL and 21 ± 0.02 ng/mL hCG for patient one and two respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Machine learning (ML) is the application of specialized algorithms to datasets for trend delineation, categorization, or prediction. ML techniques have been traditionally applied to large, highly dimensional databases. Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors, traditionally graded using histopathologic features. Recently, the World Health Organization proposed a novel grading system for gliomas incorporating molecular characteristics. We aimed to study whether ML could achieve accurate prognostication of 2-year mortality in a small, highly dimensional database of patients with glioma. Methods: We applied 3 ML techniques (artificial neural networks [ANNs], decision trees [DTs], and support vector machines [SVMs]) and classical logistic regression (LR) to a dataset consisting of 76 patients with glioma of all grades. We compared the effect of applying the algorithms to the raw database versus a database where only statistically significant features were included into the algorithmic inputs (feature selection). Results: Raw input consisted of 21 variables and achieved performance of accuracy/area (C.I.) under the curve of 70.7%/0.70 (49.9–88.5) for ANN, 68%/0.72 (53.4–90.4) for SVM, 66.7%/0.64 (43.6–85.0) for LR, and 65%/0.70 (51.6–89.5) for DT. Feature selected input consisted of 14 variables and achieved performance of 73.4%/0.75 (62.9–87.9) for ANN, 73.3%/0.74 (62.1–87.4) for SVM, 69.3%/0.73 (60.0–85.8) for LR, and 65.2%/0.63 (49.1–76.9) for DT. Conclusions: We demonstrate that these techniques can also be applied to small, highly dimensional datasets. Our ML techniques achieved reasonable performance compared with similar studies in the literature. Although local databases may be small versus larger cancer repositories, we demonstrate that ML techniques can still be applied to their analysis; however, traditional statistical methods are of similar benefit. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Analgesia with opioids such as morphine is an effective clinical strategy for the treatment of cancer pain and chronic inflammatory pain. However, long-term use of morphine can cause morphine tolerance (MT), which limits the clinical application of opioids. Polysaccharopeptide from Trametes versicolor (TPSP) is a biologically active macromolecule that exerts anti-tumor, immune-enhancing and pain-relieving effects. In order to address the clinical problem of MT, herein, we investigated the inhibitory effect and mechanism of TPSP in rats with inflammatory pain-morphine tolerance. A chronic inflammatory osteoarthritis pain-morphine tolerance model was simulated by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) through the ankle joint cavity and continuous intrathecal administration of morphine. Different doses of TPSP (50 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg and 200 μg/kg) were intrathecally administered for consecutive 3 weeks. Our results indicate that TPSP can significantly inhibit the development of morphine dependence and acute withdrawal in rats, alleviate the decrease of paw withdrawal mechanical threshold and heat stimulation retraction latency. In addition, mechanistically at the molecular level, these effects are elicited via up-regulation of the cannabinoid type 2 receptor, up-regulating the level of β-endorphin, and reducing the levels of IL-1, NO and PGE 2 .

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA-17-5p (miR-17-5p) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been reported to participate in the development and progression of multiple cancers. However, the relationship between the miR-17-5p and EMT in osteosarcoma (OS) is still poorly understood. This study was to investigate the effects of the miR-17-5p and its potential mechanism in regulating proliferation, apoptosis, and EMT of human OS. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the miR-17-5p and SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) messenger RNA expression in OS specimens and cell lines. After transfection with miR-17-5p inhibitors, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of OS cells were assessed by using the Cell Counting Kit-8, the annexin V-FITC apoptosis, wound-healing, and transwell assays. The SRCIN1 was validated as a target of the miR-17-5p through bioinformatics algorithms and luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, the expression of EMT markers, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Snail was identified by the Western blot analysis. MiR-17-5p was significantly upregulated in OS tumor samples and cell lines. It inhibited proliferation and EMT, and promoted apoptosis in OS. The SRCIN1 was identified as a direct target of the miR-17-5p. Silenced miR-17-5p could change the expression of EMT markers, such as upregulating the expression of E-cadherin, and downregulating the expression of N-cadherin and Snail through targeting the antioncogenic SRCIN1. These findings suggest that the miR-17-5p promotes cell proliferation, and EMT in human OS by directly targeting the SRCIN1, and reveal a branch of the miR-17-5p/SRCIN1/EMT signaling pathway involved in the progression of OS. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: There are few data to inform on the use of response assessment 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) following radical radiotherapy without chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This retrospective study evaluated the accuracy of PET-CT in HNSCC following radical radiotherapy. Materials and methods: In total, 138 patients with HNSCC treated with radical radiotherapy without chemotherapy who underwent a baseline and response assessment FDG PET-CT were identified. FDG PET-CT outcomes were analysed with reference to clinicopathological outcomes. Results: The median follow-up was 26 months. FDG-avid disease at baseline was present for the primary site and lymph nodes in 118 and 86 patients, respectively. With regard to the primary tumour, the negative predictive value (NPV) of a complete metabolic response (CMR) was 95%; the positive predictive value (PPV) of equivocal uptake and a positive scan were 6% and 82%, respectively. The likelihood ratios for a CMR, equivocal and positive scans of the primary site were 0.19, 0.22, 14.8, respectively. With regard to lymph node disease, the NPV of a CMR was 91%, the PPV of equivocal uptake and a positive scan were 33% and 88%, respectively. Likelihood ratios for lymph node disease for CMR, equivocal and positive scans were 0.19, 0.97 and 15.1, respectively. Conclusion: Compared with the accuracy reported in the literature following chemoradiotherapy, response assessment FDG PET-CT following radical radiotherapy without chemotherapy had a similarly high NPV, whereas the PPV following a positive scan was higher. © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists",

    "Abstract": "Background: Uveal melanoma (UM) is a severe human malignancy with a high mortality rate, as well as high metastasis and recurrence potential. The active mutation of G protein subunit alpha q (GNAQ) or G protein subunit alpha 11 (GNA11) is a major trigger for UM. Oncolytic adenovirus H101 (H101) is the first oncolytic virus approved for clinical applications in cancer therapy by the China Food and Drug Administration. We investigated whether combining H101 with the downregulation of GNAQ expression would act synergistically in UM therapy. Methods: Three UM cell lines OMM2.3 and 92.1, harboring GNAQ mutation, and OCM1, harboring B-Raf proto-oncogene mutation, were chosen for our research. The cellular toxicity of adenoviral infection and the cell growth rate were measured with a Cell Counting Kit-8. Western blot analysis was used to detect GNAQ, p-MEK1/2, YAP, and p-YAP expression. The apoptosis and cell-cycle distribution of cells were evaluated with annexin-V and propidium iodide staining. Results: Our results revealed that OMM2.3 and 92.1 cells were more sensitive to H101 infection than OCM1 cells. GNAQ expression was markedly reduced by small interfering RNA, siGNAQ. Combined treatment of siGNAQ and H101 inhibited the proliferation and activated the apoptosis of OMM2.3 and 92.1 cells by blocking the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and increasing the phosphorylation of YAP. Conclusions: In summary, a therapy combining H101 and siGNAQ is feasible, with potential utility as a novel targeted molecular therapy for UM, especially those carrying a GNAQ mutation. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In particular, TLR9 responds to DNAs with unmethylated deoxycytosine-deoxyguanosine (CpG) motifs, thereby inducing the activation of innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells, and consequently, adaptive immune cells. In this study, we developed two kinds of Y-shaped double-stranded DNA nanostructures (Y-DNAs), including a single unit composed of three DNA strands (Y S -DNA) and a ligated multiunit complex formed by crosslinking each Y S -DNA (Y L -DNA), and investigated whether they have immunostimulatory activity in innate immune cells. Y S -DNA and Y L -DNA induced the production of immune cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF-α and the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 in primary mouse dendritic cells and macrophage cells (RAW264.7 cells). A Coprecipitation study demonstrated that Y L -DNA was directly associated with TLR9. The induction of immune cytokines by Y S -DNA and Y L -DNA was abolished in TLR9-deficient primary mouse dendritic cells. The results demonstrated that Y-DNAs induced the activation of dendritic cells and macrophages mediated by the activation of TLR9, as shown by the expression of immune cytokines and costimulatory molecules. The results suggest that Y-DNA nanostructures provide a beneficial strategy for immunotherapy by modulating the immune system. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is clinically characterized by hyperglycemia. Though many studies have been done to understand the mechanism of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), however, the complete network of diabetes and its associated disorders through polygenic involvement is still under debate. The present study designed to re-analyze publicly available T2D related microarray raw datasets present in GEO database and T2D genes information present in GWAS catalog for screening out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identify key hub genes associated with T2D. T2D related microarray data downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and re-analysis performed with in house R packages scripts for background correction, normalization and identification of DEGs in T2D. Also retrieved T2D related DEGs information from GWAS catalog. Both DEGs lists were grouped after removal of overlapping genes. These screened DEGs were utilized further for identification and characterization of key hub genes in T2D and its associated diseases using STRING, WebGestalt and Panther databases. Computational analysis reveal that out of 99 identified key hub gene candidates from 348 DEGs, only four genes (CCL2, ELMO1, VEGFA and TCF7L2) along with FOS playing key role in causing T2D and its associated disorders, like nephropathy, neuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer via p53 or Wnt signaling pathways. MIR-29, and MAZ_Q6 are identified potential target microRNA and TF along with probable drugs alprostadil, collagenase and dinoprostone for the key hub gene candidates. The results suggest that identified key DEGs may play promising roles in prevention of diabetes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) entails a risk of acute respiratory failure (ARF). The decision to admit such patients to the intensive care unit (ICU) is difficult given the inexorable prognosis of ALS. To fuel this discussion, this study describes the ICU and post-ICU survival of ALS-related ARF. Material and methods: Retrospective cohort analysis over 10 years (university hospital setting, ALS reference center). Results: Of 90 patients (66 men, median age: 67 [IQR 59–71], median interval since ALS diagnosis: 26.5 months [14–53], ALSFRS-R: 19 [12−30], bulbar signs 73%), 48 were managed by noninvasive ventilation (NIV) only, 7 were already tracheotomized upon admission, 12 were tracheotomized during the ICU stay (advance care planning project), 18 were already intubated before admission, 5 received oxygen and physiotherapy only. Median ICU stay was 4 days [2-9] with 20% mortality. Median hospital stay was 10 days [5–22] with 33% mortality. The 3-month and one year mortality wer 46% and 71%. Hospital mortality was higher in patients with more severe respiratory acidosis and higher simplified acute physiology scores on admission. Conclusions: The prognosis of ALS-related ARF requiring ICU admission resembles that of ARF complicating other conditions with high short-term mortality (e.g. lung cancer). © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) (P(AA-co-AM)) hydrogels with upper critical solution temperature (UCST) were synthesized via radical copolymerization technology, which were then incorporated with SiO 2 @polypyrrole (SiO 2 @PPy) for the construction of light-, thermo- and pH-responsive drug delivery system. The synthesized SiO 2 @PPy@P(AA-co-AM) hydrogels were then examined by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermogravimetric (DTG). Finally, the designed SiO 2 @PPy@P(AA-co-AM) hydrogels were used for controlled delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an anti-cancer drug. An encapsulation ratio of up to 92.2% was obtained when 5-FU was encapsulated in the SiO 2 @PPy@P(AA-co-AM) hydrogels, and the cumulative release of 5-FU could reach 83.9% with the near-infrared (NIR) irradiation of 6 h at pH 7.4. During the controlled release of 5-FU, PPy in the system could convert the NIR irradiation to heat as a photo-thermal transducer while maintaining the temperature in the UCST range of P(AA-co-AM). In addition, SiO 2 in the hydrogels acted as a gatekeeper to prevent the burst release of 5-FU. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Osimertinib is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with antitumor activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR T790 M mutations. The incidence of oligo-progression (PD) on osimertinib is unknown. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 50 pre-treated EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib at seven Swiss centers. Oligo-PD was defined as PD in ≤ 5 lesions. Mutational profiling of pre- and post-osimertinib tumor samples was performed. Results: Median age was 62 years (37–89), 64% were females, 86% had a PS ≤ 1, 54%/13% were never/current smokers. Median follow-up was 15.3 (IQR: 8.6–21.6) months. Overall response rate was 80%, median progression-free survival 12.1 months (95% CI 8.3–18.3), median overall survival 28 months (95% CI 20.2-not reached [NR]) and median treatment duration 18.8 months (95%CI 16-8-NR). PD occurred in 36 patients (72%). 73% had oligo-PD. Median osimertinib treatment duration in patients with oligo-PD was 19.6 vs. 7 months if systemic PD (p = 0.007). The number of progressive lesions in patients with oligo-PD was 1 (27%), 2 (35%) and 3–5 (39%). Sites of PD included lungs (56%), bones (44%), and brain (17%). Sixteen patients with oligo-PD continued treatment with osimertinib for a median of 6.7 months beyond PD. Thirteen received local ablative treatment (LAT). In pre- and post-PD tumor tissue multiple molecular alterations were detected. Conclusion: In patients with acquired resistance to osimertinib, we observed a high rate (73%) of oligo-PD. Outcomes of patients receiving LAT were favorable, supporting the concept of osimertinib treatment beyond progression in combination with LAT of progressing lesions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box) ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes, S-phase kinase 2 (SKP2) is one of the major players of F-box family, that is responsible for the degradation of several important cell regulators and tumor suppressor proteins. Despite of having significant evidence for the role of SKP2 on tumorgenesis, there is a lack of available data regarding the effect of non-synonymous polymorphisms. In this communication, the structural and functional consequences of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) of SKP2 have been reported by employing various computational approaches and molecular dynamics simulation. Initially, several computational tools like SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PredictSNP, I-Mutant 2.0 and ConSurf have been implicated in this study to explore the damaging SNPs. In total of 172 nsSNPs, 5 nsSNPs were identified as deleterious and 3 of them were predicted to be decreased the stability of protein. Guided from ConSurf analysis, P101L (rs761253702) and Y346C (rs755010517) were categorized as the highly conserved and functional disrupting mutations. Therefore, these mutations were subjected to three dimensional model building and molecular dynamics simulation study for the detailed structural consequences upon the mutations. The study revealed that P101L and Y346C mutations increased the flexibility and changed the structural dynamics. As both these mutations are located in the most functional regions of SKP2 protein, these computational insights might be helpful to consider these nsSNPs for wet-lab confirmatory analysis as well as in rationalizing future population based studies and structure based drug design against SKP2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from sea cucumber Isostichopus badionotus (fCS-Ib) was depolymerized with an ultrasound-accelerated, metal-free Fenton chemistry, relying on H 2 O 2 /ascorbic acid redox system. Fragments of different molecular weights were obtained at different reaction temperatures, ascorbic acid concentrations and ultrasonic intensities. The structures of two typical depolymerized fragments were evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The results showed that ultrasound enhanced the degradation efficiency of H 2 O 2 /ascorbic acid system mainly by disaggregating sulfated polysaccharide clusters and that free radicals induced depolymerization with no significant chemical changes in the backbone of fCS-Ib and with no obvious loss of fucose branches. The antitumor activity, using A549 lung cancer cells, showed that the ultrasound treated low molecular weight sulfated fragment enhanced proliferation-inhibitory and anti-migration effects, compared to native fCS-Ib. This was different from the anticoagulant activity of fCS-Ib, suggesting that the molecular weight change may cause a conformational transition and affect biological activity. We propose that combining ultrasound with non-metal Fenton chemistry as an effective method to prepare low molecular weight fCS fragments with potential applications as functional foods, antitumor drugs, and that these fCS fragments display negligible bleeding risk. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Numerous studies have proved that heparin, a sub-group of glycosaminoglycan, possesses great potential as anti-metastasis agent. However, the native strong anti-coagulant activity which causes serious side effects, such as bleeding, has limited its clinical applications for safety concern. To overcome this problem, we synthesized a panel of novel glycopolymers that mimic heparin structure with substantially reduced anti-coagulant activity by a simple grafted-on strategy. The influence of molecular weight & distribution, substituting degree and sulfonic density on cytotoxicity were determined by systematic MTT analysis to select the candidates with highly bio-compatibility. Among these glycopolymers, a sulfated poly‑2‑aminoethyl methacrylate grafted with heparin disaccharide (abbreviated as SGPHD) has shown potent efficacy in inhibition of heparanase activity and microvascular endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. Further experiments demonstrated that SGPHD inhibited B16 murine melanoma cell migration, invasion and adhesion to platelets or microvascular endothelial cells, thus, presented as a possible anti-metastatic agent by providing a whole course protection during tumor metastasis. The results will have significant impacts for the further rational design of glycopolymer medicine. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinomas (CCCs) have 2 distinct stromas: a hyalinized/mucoid stroma and a plasma cell–rich inflammatory stroma. Clinically, CCC is the most common ovarian cancer associated with thromboembolism. Recent studies suggested a potential role of PIK3CA mutation in the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, which mediates inflammation or hemostasis. In the present study, 54 ovarian CCCs and 3 CCC cell lines were analyzed for PIK3CA hotspot mutation and COX-2 expression with special reference to stromal features. Among the 54 CCCs, 20 (37.0%) and 8 (14.8%) were classified as CCCs with a hyalinized/mucoid stroma and an inflammatory stroma, respectively. PIK3CA mutation was identified in 11 (55%) of the 20 CCCs with a hyalinized/mucoid stroma, but not in any of the 8 CCCs with an inflammatory stroma. In contrast, COX-2 expression was frequent in CCCs with an inflammatory stroma (1/20 [5%] versus 7/8 [87.5%], respectively). Such a relationship between the PIK3CA mutation, COX-2 expression, and stromal features was repeated in the 3 CCC cell lines. Thromboembolism was noted in 9 (16.7%) of the 54 CCC patients, and it was more frequent in CCCs with a hyalinized/mucoid stroma (7/20 [35%]) than in those with an inflammatory stroma (0/8 [0%]). In conclusion, there is a difference in PIK3CA mutation, COX-2 expression, and paraneoplastic thromboembolism between CCCs with a different stroma. It is suggested that a different stromal feature, either hyalinized/mucoid change or inflammation, represents a different molecular genetic background or hemostatic potential in ovarian CCCs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Thirty interstitial cell tumors (ICTs) from domestic rabbits collected from Zoo/Exotic Pathology Service, Northwest ZooPath, and Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University were submitted for histologic review and immunohistochemistry for p53 and Ki-67 along with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were: (1) to determine the prevalence of testicular granular cell tumors (GCTs) in domestic rabbits within ICTs using PAS staining, and (2) to evaluate morphologic criteria and immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67 and p53 to prognosticate testicular ICTs, in domestic rabbits. The prevalence of ICTs was 1.93% of all submissions and 87% of all testicular tumors. All cases histologically diagnosed as ICT were reclassified as GCT based on PAS staining. Neither labeling for p53 nor the Ki-67 index was prognostically significant. Median survival time of rabbits diagnosed with GCTs was 599 days. No metastatic disease was reported in rabbits diagnosed with ICTs following surgical removal. This study found that the majority of ICTs in rabbit testicles are GCTs and staining with PAS is required to confirm the diagnosis. Regardless, surgical removal (castration) of domestic rabbits with GCTs is an appropriate treatment for this disease and no further investigation is required. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Family communication is a known protective factor for minor children's psychological health following the death of a parent, but there is little research describing communication within such families specifically from the perspective of the children. The purpose of this study was therefore to explore communication in parentally bereaved families from the perspective of the children and surviving parent. Methods: Interviews with four parents and four children from four families were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Interviews took place in the family's home or at the research center based on the family's wishes 4–14 months after a parent had died. Interviews had an open approach and were based on an interview guide. Each interview was between 60 and 120 min long. Results: Four categories emerged which were related to family members’ experiences of family communication while adjusting to their new circumstances as bereaved: the importance of open and honest communication in the family; new challenges in the family which affect communication; communicating the need for help; and talking about and remembering the deceased parent. Conclusions: This study illuminates the connection between family communication and adjustments to new circumstances following the death of a parent. The results suggest that the relationship between family adjustment and communication may be circular whereby the family's ability to adjust to their new circumstances is affected by how the family communicates.

    "Abstract": "Colorectal adenomas are common precancerous lesions with the potential for malignant transformation to colorectal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic polypectomy provides an opportunity for cancer prevention; however, recurrence rates are high. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of 15 primary adenomas with recurrence, 15 adenomas without recurrence, and 14 matched pair samples (primary adenoma and the corresponding recurrent adenoma). The samples were analysed by array-comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) and single-cell multiplex interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (miFISH) to understand clonal evolution, to examine the dynamics of copy number alterations (CNAs) and to identify molecular markers for recurrence prediction. The miFISH probe panel consisted of 14 colorectal carcinogenesis-relevant genes (COX2, PIK3CA, APC, CLIC1, EGFR, MYC, CCND1, CDX2, CDH1, TP53, HER2, SMAD7, SMAD4 and ZNF217), and a centromere probe (CEP10). The aCGH analysis confirmed the genetic landscape typical for colorectal tumorigenesis, that is, CNAs of chromosomes 7, 13q, 18 and 20q. Focal aberrations (≤10 Mbp) were mapped to chromosome bands 6p22.1-p21.33 (33.3%), 7q22.1 (31.4%) and 16q21 (29.4%). MiFISH detected gains of EGFR (23.6%), CDX2 (21.8%) and ZNF217 (18.2%). Most adenomas exhibited a major clone population which was accompanied by multiple smaller clone populations. Gains of CDX2 were exclusively seen in primary adenomas with recurrence (25%) compared to primary adenomas without recurrence (0%). Generation of phylogenetic trees for matched pair samples revealed four distinct patterns of clonal dynamics. In conclusion, adenoma development and recurrence are complex genetic processes driven by multiple CNAs whose evaluations by miFISH, with emphasis on CDX2, might serve as a predictor of recurrence. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Reaction of 5-morphilinosulfonylisatin (1) with acetophenones (2a–e) afforded 3-hydroxy-3-substituted-2-oxoindoles 3a-e, when treated with acetic acid the expected 3-phenacylidene-2-oxoindoles 4a-d and 4-hydroxy-5′-(morpholinosulfonyl) spiro [chromene-2, 3′-indolin]-2′-one 6 were obtained. Isatin derivative (1) was stirred with cyano derivatives to produce the arylidines (7a-c), while under reflux condition, it gave pyrrolo[2,3–b]indoles (8, 9). Moreover, istain (1) reacted with pyrazolo-5-one or 3-substituted phenol in presence of malononitrile to afford spiroxindole derivatives (10a,b) and (11a,b). Also, compounds (10a,b) and (11a,b) were obtained through cyclization of (7a) with pyrazolo-5-one or 3-substituted phenol. The obtained compounds were identified by IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and elemental analysis. Anticancer activity against three cancer cell lines (HepG-2, HCT-116 and MCF-7) were evaluated using sulforhodamine B assay method. Compounds 4b, 4c, 7a, 7c and 9 showed broad spectrum anticancer activity on the three tested cell lines with IC 50 values less than 10 µM. Cell cycle analysis was performed for the most promising derivatives, compounds 4b and 7c arrested HepG-2 cells at G2-M phase, while compounds 7a and 9 accumulated cells at G0-G1 phase, all of them induced apoptosis at priG1 phase in the range of (11.32–19.17%). Additionally compounds 4b, 7a and 9 showed more potent activity against EGFR than Lapatinib, their IC 50 values are from 0.019 to 0.026 µM while IC 50 of Lapatinib is 0.028 µM. Molecular docking studies were conducted to investigate the binding mode, amino acid interactions and free binding energy of these potent derivatives. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, with patients exhibiting poor survival (median survival time: 15 months). Difficulties in treating GBM include not only the inability to resect the diffusively-invading tumor cells, but also therapeutic resistance. The perivascular niche (PVN) within the GBM tumor microenvironment contributes significantly to tumor cell invasion, cancer stem cell maintenance, and has been shown to protect tumor cells from radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we examine how the inclusion of non-tumor cells in culture with tumor cells within a hydrogel impacts the overall gene expression profile of an in vitro artificial perivascular niche (PVN) comprised of endothelial and stromal cells directly cultured with GBM tumor cells within a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin hydrogel. Using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that genes related to angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling are upregulated in the PVN model compared to hydrogels containing only tumor or perivascular niche cells, while downregulated genes are related to cell cycle and DNA damage repair. Signaling pathways and genes commonly implicated in GBM malignancy, such as MGMT, EGFR, PI3K-Akt signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling are also upregulated in the PVN model. We describe the kinetics of gene expression within the PVN hydrogels over a course of 14 days, observing the patterns associated with tumor cell-mediated endothelial network co-option and regression. We finally examine the effect of temozolomide, a frontline chemotherapy used clinically against GBM, on the PVN culture. Notably, the PVN model is less responsive to TMZ compared to hydrogels containing only tumor cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that inclusion of cellular and matrix-associated elements of the PVN within an in vitro model of GBM allows for the development of gene expression patterns and therapeutic response relevant to GBM. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "As the most commonly occurring form of primary renal tumor, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignancy accompanied by a high mortality rate. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) has been established as a protein target and generated considerable interest in both the pharmaceutical and academia industry. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of si-PDK1 on the RCC cell apoptosis, proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in connection with the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway. Microarray analysis from the GEO database was adopted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to RCC, after which the positive expression of the PDK1 protein in tissue was determined accordingly. The optimal silencing si-RNA was subsequently selected and RCC cell lines 786-O and A498 were selected and transfected with either a si-PDK1 or activator of the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway for grouping purposes. The mRNA and protein expressions of PDK1, the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway-, EMT- and apoptosis-related genes were then evaluated. The effect of si-PDK1 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration was then analyzed. Through microarray analysis of GSE6344, GSE53757, GSE14762 and GSE781, PDK1 was examined. PDK1 was determined to be highly expressed in RCC tissues. Si-PDK1 exhibited marked reductions in relation to the mRNA and protein expression of PDK1, PI3K, AKT as well as Vimentin while elevated mRNA and protein expressions of E-cadherin were detected, which ultimately suggested that cell migration, proliferation and invasion had been inhibited coupled with enhanced levels of cell apoptosis. While a notable observation was made highlighting that the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway antagonized the effect of PDK1 silencing. Taken together, the key observations of this study provide evidence suggesting that high expressions of PDK1 are found in RCC, while highlighting that silencing PDK1 could inhibit RCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT by repressing the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: Understanding physician-level discrepancies is increasingly a target of US healthcare reform for the delivery of quality-focused patient care. Objective: To estimate the relative contributions of patient and surgeon characteristics to the variability in key outcomes after partial nephrectomy (PN). Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective review of 1461 patients undergoing PN performed by 19 surgeons between 2011 and 2016 at a tertiary care referral center. Intervention: PN for a renal mass. Outcomes measurements and statistical analysis: Hierarchical linear and logistic regression models were built to determine the percentage variability contributed by fixed patient and surgeon factors on peri- and postoperative outcomes. Residual between- and within-surgeon variability was calculated while adjusting for fixed factors. Results and limitations: On null hierarchical models, there was significant between-surgeon variability in operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), ischemia time, excisional volume loss, length of stay, positive margins, Clavien complications, and 30-d readmission rate (all p < 0.001), but not chronic kidney disease upstaging (p = 0.47) or percentage preservation of glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.49). Patient factors explained 82% of the variability in excisional volume loss and 0–32% of the variability in the remainder of outcomes. Quantifiable surgeon factors explained modest amounts (10–40%) of variability in intraoperative outcomes, and noteworthy amounts of variability (90–100%) in margin rates and patient morbidity outcomes. Immeasurable surgeon factors explained the residual variability in operative time (27%), EBL (6%), and ischemia time (31%). Conclusions: There is significant between-surgeon variability in outcomes after PN, even after adjusting for patient characteristics. While renal functional outcomes are consistent across surgeons, measured and unmeasured surgeon factors account for 18–100% of variability of the remaining peri- and postoperative variables. With the increasing utilization of value-based medicine, this has important implications for the goal of optimizing patient care. Patient summary: We reviewed our institutional database on partial nephrectomy performed for renal cancer. We found significant variability between surgeons for key outcomes after the intervention, even after adjusting for patient characteristics. There is significant between-surgeon variability in outcomes after partial nephrectomy, even after adjusting for patient characteristics. While renal functional outcomes are consistent across surgeons, measured and unmeasured surgeon factors account for 20–100% of the variability for the remaining peri- and postoperative variables. This has important implications for the goal of optimizing patient care with the increasing utilization of value-based medicine. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a drug delivery system for chemo-hyperthermia applications is proposed and fabricated. The delivery system consists of magnetic-silica (MagSi) particles being encapsulated within a pH/thermo-responsive chitosan‑g‑N‑isopropylacrylamide (Chi-g-NIPAAm) polymer matrix. The as-prepared MagSi@Chi-g-NIPAAm particles exhibit superparamagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization (Ms) of 20.14 emu/g. In addition, the MagSi@Chi-g-NIPAAm particles can act as a heat source when subject to an alternating magnetic field (AMF) and have a specific absorptions rate (SAR) of 8.36 Wg−1. The release of the drug DOX from the synthesized particles is sensitive to both the pH and temperature of its environment. We have compared the drug release when the solution is externally heated up and when it is heated up by the AMF (internal heating). For external heating (when the pH/temperature is 4.0/45 °C), 83.30 ± 2.92% of the DOX were released within the first 5 h. The release of the DOX by the particles in pH 7.4 (temperature of 37 °C) was much slower (around 25.87 ± 1.30% after 25 h). The release of the DOX was much higher (under an acidic condition pH = 4.0) around 57.13 ± 2.36% within 1 h in the presence of AMF heating. The in vitro cytotoxicity tests of the of DOX-loaded MagSi@Chi-g-NIPAAm particles towards HeLa cancer cells. In general, the toxicities of the drug DOX as part of a MagSi@Chi-g-NIPAAm particles were less than those of the standalone DOX until the concentration of DOX-loaded particles reached 250 μg/mL, after which the toxicity of DOX in both forms were the same. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "This article outlines the synthesis of gadolinium (Gd)-doped manganese zinc ferrite magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as potential magnetic carriers for magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH). MNPs with high specific loss power (SLP; 146 W/g) have been developed and used for an in vitro hyperthermia study. The treatment of MFH is fruitful if there is an adequate number of MNPs in tumor cells with the highest SLP to rapidly generate heat while minimizing thermal injury to surrounding healthy tissue. X-ray diffraction patterns of the studied particles confirm the formation of a cubic spinel structure. Field emission scanning electron micrographs showed homogeneous distributions of particles with some agglomerates with a granular appearance. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed the presence of agglomerated spherical particles at the surface. The substitution of Gd resulted in superparamagnetism at room temperature as confirmed by vibrating sample magnetometer analysis. The estimated saturation magnetization reduced from 48.6 to 28.2 emu/g with an increase in Gd concentration. However, the coercivity increased from 1093 Oe to 1597 Oe. Field cooled and zero field cooled measurements showed Curie temperatures from 315 to 326 K, as required for MFH applications. Cell viability measurements indicated that the MNPs are nontoxic to A549 cells for the studied concentrations of particle fraction and a contact time of up to 24 h. The interaction of the MNPs with A549 cells was highlighted from an image captured by an inverted microscope. In order to treat cancer in vivo, an in vitro hyperthermia study has initially been carried out with A549 cells. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To determine the association between brain structural changes and gait speed in a four-year longitudinal prospective cohort study. Measurements: A total of 767 well-functioning community-dwelling participants, free of arthritis, silent infarct, stroke, dementia, head injury, and cancer, completed baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging scan and gait speed tests between 2011 and 2014, and follow-up tests between 2015 and 2017. The gait test consisted of measuring the elapsed time to walk four meters at usual speed. To estimate whether brain volume changes predict gait speed decline at follow-up, a generalized linear regression model was used after adjusting for potential confounding factors including gait speed at baseline. Results: Participants who experienced ≥0.05 m/s gait speed decline, previously defined as a clinically meaningful decline, were more likely to be women, less likely to be smokers, and had lower physical activity scores (p = 0.003, p = 0.025, and p = 0.006, respectively), as compared to those who did not experience the decline. Also, they demonstrated smaller volumes of hippocampus, total gray matter, parietal gray matter, temporal gray matter, and temporal white matter (p = 0.004, p = 0.042, p = 0.021, p = 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). Even after correcting the significance level due to multiple comparisons, overall gray matter and overall white matter volume changes during four-year follow-up period showed significant associations with gait speed at follow-up (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002). Regarding region-specific volumes, frontal white matter and parietal gray matter volume changes demonstrated significant associations with gait speed (p = 0.002, p = 0.004, respectively). Conclusion: In a four-year longitudinal study among 767 well-functioning community-dwelling healthy participants from a general population, we observed a significant association between brain volume changes and gait speed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Fisetin, a polyphenolic compound, has drawn notable attention owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and neuroprotective effects. However, the cardiac effects of fisetin are not clear yet. Hypothesis: The aim of the present study is to examine the cardioprotective effect of fisetin against Ang-II induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells and in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR). Methods/study design: The in vitro protective effect of fisetin was evaluated after the cells were treated with fisetin (50 µM/ml/ 24 h) for 2 h prior or after Ang-II administration to induce apoptosis. For in vivo experiments, SHRs were orally administered with fisetin (10 mg/kg) twice a week for 6 weeks. Cellular apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining assay and the modulation in the expression levels of proteins involved in apoptosis and cell survival were determined by western blotting. Results: Our results demonstrate the potent cardioprotective efficacy of fisetin against Ang-II induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells and in SHR models. Fisetin administration reduced the apoptotic nuclei considerably And reduced the expression of apoptotic proteins such as TNF- α, Fas L, FADD, Cleaved caspase-3 and Cleaved PARP and increased the cell survival and anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2, Bcl-x L, p-IGF1R, p-PI3K and p-AKT in both in vitro and in vivo models. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results of the present study reveal that fisetin activates the IGF-IR-dependent p-PI3K/p-Akt survival signaling pathway and suppresses the caspase dependent apoptosis. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "CaO-P 2 O 5 -SiO 2 -BaO-Fe 2 O 3 magnetic bioactive glasses were prepared via an optimized sol–gel method. This study is focused on investigating effects of magnetic content addition on the bioactive glass properties. To this aim, we evaluate the physical, rheological, and biocompatibility properties of synthesized magnetic bioactive glass. The morphology and composition of these glasses were studied using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The particle size was also determined using Laser Particle Size Analyzer (LPSA). The thermal measurements were carried out using Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). For assessing the in-vitro bioactive character of synthesized glasses, the ability for apatite formation on their surface upon immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) was checked using SEM, EDX and pH measurements. Furthermore, the Ca, Si, Ba and Fe ions in SBF were monitored using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results showed that the addition of Ba and Fe in the glass composition affect formation of apatite layer onto the glass surfaces. Morphologies of the apatite layers were also different in which the bioactivity decreased with increasing Fe concentration, but the increase of Ba concentration led to an increase in bioactivity. However all of the synthesized glasses are still highly bioactive. Finally, this research demonstrates that the synthesized magnetic bioactive glasses are nontoxic and biocompatible and they can be used as thermoseeds for cancer hyperthermia studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The design of new Ru(II) organometallics is a subject of interest to the field of anticancer metallodrugs. This work reports the interaction of the Ru(II)-η 6 -p-cymene framework with naproxen-pyridineamide (Npxpya, L1), a structurally modified form of the naproxen (HNpx, HL2) drug, to give the new organometallic [Ru(η 6 -p-cymene)(L1)Cl 2 ] (1) bearing the Npxpya ligand. The reported naproxenate-derived, [Ru(η 6 -p-cymene)(L2)Cl] (2), is re-prepared, also from the precursor [Ru(η 6 -p-cymene)Cl 2 ] 2 (3), and additional investigation is performed. The two Ru(II)-arenes and the L1 ligand are fully characterized by ESI-MS, NMR, ATR/FT-IR and UV/VIS, and their structures corroborated by DFT computational calculations. Time-dependent 1 H MNR studies show that both Ru(II)-arenes, despite being stable in non-coordinating solvents, undergo distinct step dissociation in dimethylsulfoxide solvent to give the corresponding drug ligands and [Ru(η 6 -p-cymene)(dmso)Cl 2 ] (4) species. Electronic absorption spectroscopy experimental data show good correlation with DFT calculations. Organometallics 1 and 2, as well as their corresponding parent drug ligands, exhibit luminescence properties mainly associated to the naproxen moiety. Screening in NCI-H460 and A549 lung cancer cells reveals lack of activity for 2 and L2, while the new organometallic 1 is found to inhibit cell proliferation of both types of cell lines in similar way to the L1 drug. The structural modification, by inserting the pyridineamide moiety into the original structure of naproxen to form the Npxpya conjugated drug, is shown to be crucial for the anticancer activity. Compound 1, despite having IC 50 close to the IC 50 of L1, does not show significant effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), in contrast to the behavior of the free L1 parent drug which significantly decreases the MMP in NCI-H460 cells. Interestingly, since 1 H MNR studies indicate that organometallic 1 is completely dissociated in dmso (the solvent used to prepare the drug solutions for cell treatment in the biological assays) to give the L1 free drug and species 4, it is plausible to infer that the presence of Npxpya-free Ru species, probably in the form of species 4, might play a role in inhibiting the mechanism related to the mitochondrial function when the cells are treated with 1, in comparison with the cell treatment with the L1 free drug. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Geothermal power plants for the production of electricity are currently active in Mt. Amiata, Italy. The present study aimed to investigate the association between chronic low-level exposure to H 2 S and health outcomes, using a residential cohort study design. Methods: Spatial variability of exposure to chronic levels of H 2 S was evaluated using dispersion modelling. Cohorts included people residing in six municipalities of the geothermal district from 01/01/1998 to 31/12/2016. Residence addresses were georeferenced and each subject was matched with H 2 S exposure metrics and socio-economic status available at census tract level. Mortality and hospital discharge data for neoplasms and diseases of the respiratory, central nervous and cardiovascular systems were taken from administrative health databases. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the association between H 2 S exposure and outcomes, with age as the temporal axis and adjusting for gender, socio-economic status and calendar period. Results: The residential cohort was composed of 33,804 subjects for a total of 391,002 person-years. Analyses reported risk increases associated with high exposure to H 2 S for respiratory diseases (HR = 1.12 95%CI: 1.00–1.25 for mortality data; HR = 1.02 95%CI: 0.98–1.06 for morbidity data), COPD and disorders of the peripheral nervous system. Neoplasms were negatively associated with increased H 2 S exposure. Conclusions: The most consistent findings were reported for respiratory diseases. Associations with increased H 2 S exposure were coherent in both mortality and hospitalization analyses, for both genders, with evidence of exposure-related trends. No positive associations were found for cancer or cardiovascular diseases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Carbon ion radiotherapy is a promising therapeutic option for glioblastoma patients due to its high physical dose conformity and greater biological effectiveness than photons. However, the biological effects of carbon ion radiation are still incompletely understood. Here, we systematically compared the biological effects of clinically used carbon ion radiation to photon radiation with emphasis on DNA repair. Materials and methods: Two human glioblastoma cell lines (U87 and LN229) were irradiated with carbon ions or photons and DNA damage response was systematically analyzed, including clonogenic survival, induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), cell cycle arrest and apoptosis or autophagy. γH2AX foci were analyzed by flow cytometry, conventional light microscopy and 3D superresolution microscopy. Results: DSBs were repaired delayed and with slower kinetics after carbon ions versus photons. Carbon ions caused stronger and longer-lasting cell cycle delays, predominantly in G2 phase, and a higher rate of apoptosis. Compared to photons, the effectiveness of carbon ions was less cell cycle-dependent. Homologous recombination (HR) appeared to be more important for DSB repair after carbon ions versus photons in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient U87 cells, as opposed to PTEN-proficient LN229 cells. Conclusion: Carbon ions induced more severe DSB damage than photons, which was repaired less efficiently in both cell lines. Thus, carbon ion radiotherapy may help to overcome resistance mechanisms of glioblastoma associated with DNA repair for example in combination with repair pathway-specific drugs in the context of personalized radiotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "ABT-737, ABT-263 (Navitoclax) and ABT-199 (Venetoclax) are under intensive preclinical and clinical investigation as treatments for hematologic and other malignancies. These small molecules mimic pro-death B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) Homology 3 (BH3) domain-only proteins. They also bear a structural resemblance to certain sigma (σ) receptor ligands. Moreover, the Bcl-2 and σ receptor protein families are both located primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum, mediate cell death and survival through protein–protein interactions, and physically associate. Accordingly, we examined the ability of the ABT series of BH3 mimetics to interact with σ receptors using radioligand-binding techniques. Negative allosteric modulation of [ 3 H](+)-pentazocine, an agonist, binding to σ 1 receptors in guinea pig brain membranes was observed for ABT-737, ABT-263 and ABT-199. Findings included reduction of specific binding to distinct plateaus in concentration-dependent fashion, significant slowing of radioligand dissociation kinetics, and decreases in radioligand affinity with no or modest changes in maximal receptor densities. Using a ternary complex model, dissociation constants (K X ) for modulator binding to the σ 1 receptor ranged from 1 to 2.5 μM, while negative cooperativity factors (α), representing the changes in affinity of ligand and modulator when bound as a ternary complex with the receptor, ranged from 0.15 to 0.42. These observations were extended and reinforced by studies using intact small cell (NCI-H69) and non-small cell (NCI-H23) lung cancer cells, and by using an antagonist σ 1 receptor radioligand, E-N-1-(3′-[ 125 I]iodoallyl)-N′-4-(3″,4″-dimethoxyphenethyl)piperazine, in mouse brain membranes. By contrast, exploratory studies indicate marked enhancement of the σ 2 receptor binding of [ 3 H]1,3-di-(o-tolyl)guanidine/(+)-pentazocine in NCI-H23 cells and guinea pig brain membranes. These findings raise intriguing questions regarding mechanism and potential functional outcomes. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Drug resistance and off-organ toxicity remain unsolved issues in chemotherapy of advanced-stage melanoma patients. Thus, the creation of new molecular conjugates able to combine a selective accumulation, high ability of internalization and signaling pathway inhibition, are highly requested. Recently, we reported a new class of molecular conjugates, compounds 1–3, where the anti-αVβ3 integrin peptidomimetic c(AmpRGD), which is a selective ligand for αVβ3 integrin, was covalently bound to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Here, we report that these c(AmpRGD)-sunitinib conjugates and, in particular, compound 3, are selectively internalized by human melanoma cells through αVβ3 receptor-mediated endocytosis. Compound 3 is more effective than sunitinib in reducing in vitro melanoma cells proliferation, cloning efficiency, migration, and invasion. More interestingly, compound 3 is able to significantly reduce the growth of xenografted melanoma tumor developed in immune-compromised mice, more efficiently than an equimolar dose of sunitinib. Indeed, its targeting ability was demonstrated by the selective localization at the tumor level with respect to healthy tissues. Thus, c(AmpRGD)-sunitinib conjugates such as compound 3 could serve as intriguing multiple-target agents to selectively reach melanoma cells and interfere with the progression of the disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A novel probe for laparoscopic in vivo detection of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) has been developed. The main application for in vivo detection of SPIONs our research group aims at is sentinel node biopsy. This is a method to determine if a tumor has spread through the body, which helps to improve cancer patient care. The method we use to selectively detect SPIONs is Differential Magnetometry (DiffMag). DiffMag makes use of small magnetic field strengths in the mT range. For DiffMag, a handheld probe is used that contains excitation and detection coils. However, depth sensitivity of a handheld probe is restricted by the diameter of the coils. Therefore, excitation and detection coils are separated in our novel probe. As a result, excitation coils can be made large and placed underneath a patient to generate a sufficiently large volume for the excitation field. Detection coils are made small enough to be used in laparoscopic surgery. The main challenge of this setup is movement of detection coils with respect to excitation coils. Consequently, the detector signal is obscured by the excitation field, making it impossible to measure the tiny magnetic signature from SPIONs. To measure SPIONs, active compensation is used, which is a way to cancel the excitation field seen by the detection coils. SPIONs were measured in various amounts and at various distances from the excitation coils. Furthermore, SPIONs were measured in proximity to a surgical steel retractor, and 3 L water. It is shown that small amounts of SPIONs (down to 25 μg Fe) can be measured, and SPIONs can be measured up to 20 cm from the top of the excitation coil. Also, surgical steel, and diamagnetism of water – and thus of tissue – have minor influence on DiffMag measurements. In conclusion, these results make this novel probe geometry combined with DiffMag promising for laparoscopic sentinel node biopsy. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Identification of incidental pancreatic lesions is increasing because of advancements in imaging. Diagnosis remains a challenge for clinicians, with intrapancreatic accessory spleens (IPAS) posing a unique dilemma. IPAS are frequently resected because of inability to exclude alternate diagnoses, subjecting patients to unnecessary risk. The purpose of this study was to examine our institutional experience with IPAS and develop a multidisciplinary algorithm to improve preoperative diagnosis. Materials and methods: Patients who underwent a distal pancreatectomy at a single institution from 2005 to 2018 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Examination of final pathology for a diagnosis of IPAS yielded the final cohort. Demographics, preoperative workup, and operative course were reviewed and analyzed. A diagnostic algorithm was composed based on the consensus of a panel of expert pancreatic surgeons, a radiologist, and a pathologist. Results: Ten patients of 303 patients who underwent a distal pancreatectomy were identified with a final pathology of IPAS. The average age was 54 y, 80% were white, and 60% were male. Lesions ranged in size from 7 mm to 5.1 cm in largest diameter (mean 2.2 cm). Lesions were described as round, well-marginated, and enhancing masses within the pancreatic tail. Preoperative workup was variable in terms of imaging and laboratory testing. Diagnostic workups were examined and combined with multidisciplinary input to create a diagnostic algorithm. Conclusions: Incidental pancreatic lesions like IPAS remain a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Employing a diagnostic algorithm as proposed may aid in the distinction of malignant and premalignant pathology and prevent unwarranted pancreatic resections. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Machine learning approaches hold great potential for the automated detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs, but training algorithms requires very large amounts of manually annotated radiographs, which are difficult to obtain. The increasing availability of PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System), is laying the technological foundations needed to make available large volumes of clinical data and images from hospital archives. Binary labels indicating whether a radiograph contains a pulmonary lesion can be extracted at scale, using natural language processing algorithms. In this study, we propose two novel neural networks for the detection of chest radiographs containing pulmonary lesions. Both architectures make use of a large number of weakly-labelled images combined with a smaller number of manually annotated x-rays. The annotated lesions are used during training to deliver a type of visual attention feedback informing the networks about their lesion localisation performance. The first architecture extracts saliency maps from high-level convolutional layers and compares the inferred position of a lesion against the true position when this information is available; a localisation error is then back-propagated along with the softmax classification error. The second approach consists of a recurrent attention model that learns to observe a short sequence of smaller image portions through reinforcement learning; the reward function penalises the exploration of areas, within an image, that are unlikely to contain nodules. Using a repository of over 430,000 historical chest radiographs, we present and discuss the proposed methods over related architectures that use either weakly-labelled or annotated images only. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This is the first such study investigating BTEX in this understudied, yet largely populated, region in the Middle East with attention geared towards spatial and diurnal trends, health effects of BTEX, and amount of BTEX emissions in gas stations versus CNG stations. © 2019 Elsevier LtdThis study characterized spatio-temporal variations in the concentration of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) compounds in the vicinity of gas and compressed natural gas (CNG) stations in Tehran, Iran. Health risk assessment (HRA) was computed using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) for evaluating inhalation lifetime cancer risk (LTCR), the hazard quotient (HQ), and sensitivity analysis (SA) for BTEX exposure in different age groups (birth to &lt;81) and as a function of distance (0–250 m) from the center of the stations. For all monitoring stations, the average values of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene in winter were 466.09 ± 132.25, 873.13 ± 233.51, 493.05 ± 141.22, and 910.57 ± 145.40 μg m −3 , respectively. The mean wintertime ratios of T/B for the 12 stations ranged from 1.69 to 2.04. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between the concentration of BTEX with either the specific month or distance from the center of stations (p &gt; 0.05). Factors promoting BTEX formation in the study region were fuel evaporation and gas/CNG station emissions. The LTCRs for the target compounds in the winter for different age groups and distances from the center of stations was limited to 2.11 × 10 −4 to 1.82 × 10 −3 and 2.30 × 10 −4 to 2.01 × 10 −3 , respectively, which exceeded proposed values by U.S. EPA. Moreover, the HQs for BTEX for three age groups and distances were limited to between 2.89 × 10 −5 and 9.33 × 10 −2 , which were lower than the acceptable limit (HQs &lt; 1). The results of this work are applicable to similar areas that are heavily populated with vehicular traffic. This study motivates a closer look at mitigation strategies to limit the health effects of carcinogenic emissions such as benzene and ethylbenzene from gas/CNG stations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "In the use of solution-based 3D nanoarchitectures for optics, drug delivery, and cancer treatment, the precise nanoparticle architecture morphologies, architecture sizes, interparticle distances, and the assembly stability are all critical to their functionality. 3D nanoparticle architectures in solution are difficult to characterize, as few techniques can provide individualized information on interparticle spacing (defined by linkage molecule), nanoparticle assembly size, morphology, and identification of false aggregation. Bulk characterization techniques, including small angle x-ray scattering, can provide architecture sizes, though they are unable to precisely measure differences within interparticle spacings for individual architectures and can falsely measure assemblies caused by non-linkage grouped nanoparticles. Two solution-based characterization techniques were used to determine which assembly type and linkage length would produce the fastest assembly rate for large DNA-directed gold nanoparticle assemblies. In-situ liquid-cell scanning transmission electron microscopy (LC-STEM), measured interparticle spacings between DNA-functionalized nanoparticles, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy provided the bulk volume fraction of large and small assemblies for nanoparticle architectures that were assembled using two different types: (1) the hybrid assemblies join two complementary single-stranded DNA linkages, and (2) the bridged assemblies are comprised of single-stranded DNA (bridging component) that is double the length of two different complementary single-stranded DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles. Assembly times were tested at 24-hrs intervals over 3 days. Statistics derived from the in-situ LC-STEM images provided data for interparticle distance measurements, which identified the fraction of nanoparticles within the images acquired that were at the expected double-stranded DNA-binding distance of the linkages (varied in three distances for each of the two different architectures). In general, longer linkage lengths assembled in the shortest amount of time. The bridged assemblies formed fewer large architectures at 24-hrs but ultimately assembled a greater fraction of nanoparticles, which was due to the longer functionalized DNA lengths for individual nanoparticles. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy provided a bulk average of the gold nanoparticle assembly sizes over time, which supported the conclusions drawn from the in-situ LC-STEM data. The microscopy provided sub-2 nm precision in the interparticle distances between gold nanoparticles in a solution environment. This coupled microscopy and spectroscopy characterization approach can provide more detailed information than bulk characterization methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Busulfan (BU) has a destructive effect on the male reproductive system. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of olive leaf extract (OLE) as a source of antioxidants and phenolic compounds, on BU-induced damages in rat testes. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups. The control group (CTL) received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by oral administration of distilled water for 5 weeks. In BU group, BU (10 mg/kg) was administrated i.p. once. In co-treatment groups, first, received BU (10 mg/kg, a single i.p. injection) then, OLE was administrated orally at different doses of 250 mg/kg (BU+OLE 250), 500 mg/kg (BU+OLE 500) and 750 mg/kg (BU+OLE 750), for 5 weeks. Next, blood and sperm samples were collected. The left testis was removed to investigate testicular parameters and apoptosis by using H&E and TUNEL staining, respectively. All data were analyzed by SPSS software and a P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: There was a significant decline in sperm viability (P=0.017), number of primary spermatocyte (PS) (P=0.001) and Leydig cells (P=0.023) in the BU group versus the CTL group. OLE at three doses could repair these defects versus BU group. Increases in apoptotic spermatogonia cells (SG) due to BU were significantly reduced by OLE 250 and 500 mg/kg (P<0.01). A reduction in germinal epithelium height and an increase in apoptotic SG were observed in BU+OLE 750 group vs. other groups (P<0.01) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was at the highest level, also Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased markedly vs. CTL (P=0.024). Conclusion: Oral administration of OLE at the doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg could be helpful in ameliorating BU-induced toxicity in rat testes, while OLE 750 mg/kg not only did not cause positive effects, but also could exacerbate the harmful effects. © 2019, Royan Institute (ACECR).

    "Abstract": "The interactions between two Pd complexes, designated as [Pd 3 (C,N-(C 6 H 4 C(Cl) = NO)-4) 6 ] (complex 1) and [Pd 3 (C 12 H 8 C = NO) 6 ] (complex 2), with the human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA, 5′-G 3 (T 2 AG 3 ) 3 -3′ (HTG21), were monitored using spectroscopic, biological, and molecular modeling studies. According to the UV–vis results, these complexes can strongly induce and stabilize G-quadruplex DNA structure with K b1 = 4.5(±0.3) × 10 6 M −1 and K b2 = 1.0(±0.2) × 10 7 M −1 via groove mode in comparison with duplex DNA. The release mechanism of the Pd complexes from BSA nanoparticles followed a biphasic pattern unlike that of algal cellulose nanoparticles in vitro. In addition, the cytotoxicity of these complexes on MCF-7 cancer cells and PBMC normal cells was evaluated and compared with cisplatin under similar experimental conditions. Furthermore, to determine and verify the interaction mode of these compounds with G-quadruplex, the molecular docking technique was also performed. Our data clearly demonstrated that complex 2 had higher activity and cytotoxicity than that of complex 1 and could be further investigated in the future as a drug discovery platform. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To quantitatively evaluate a superresolution technique for 3D, one-millimeter isotropic diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the whole breasts. Methods: Isotropic 3D DWI datasets are obtained using a combination of (i) a readout-segmented diffusion-weighted-echo-planar imaging (DW-EPI) sequence (rs-EPI), providing high in-plane resolution, and (ii) a superresolution (SR) strategy, which consists of acquiring 3 datasets with thick slices (3 mm) and 1-mm shifts in the slice direction, and combining them into a 1 × 1 × 1-mm 3 dataset using a dedicated reconstruction. Two SR reconstruction schemes were investigated, based on different regularization schemes: conventional Tikhonov or Beltrami (an edge-preserving constraint). The proposed SR strategy was compared to native 1 × 1 × 1-mm 3 acquisitions (i.e. with 1-mm slice thickness) in 8 healthy subjects, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency, using a theoretical framework, Monte Carlo simulations and region-of-interest (ROI) measurements, and image sharpness metrics. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in normal breast tissue were also compared. Results: The SR images resulted in an SNR gain above 3 compared to native 1 × 1 × 1-mm 3 using the same acquisition duration (acquisition gain 3 and reconstruction gain &gt;1). Beltrami-SR provided the best results in terms of SNR and image sharpness. The ADC values in normal breast measured from Beltrami-SR were preserved compared to low-resolution images (1.91 versus 1.97 ×10 –3 mm 2 /s, P =.1). Conclusion: A combination of rs-EPI and SR allows 3D, 1-mm isotropic breast DWI data to be obtained with better SNR than a native 1-mm isotropic acquisition. The proposed DWI protocol might be of interest for breast cancer monitoring/screening without injection. © 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",

    "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most aggressive bone tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to implicate in the pathogenesis of different types of cancers, including OS. This study aimed to explore the roles of miR-338-3p in OS and investigate the underlying mechanism. Human OS cell lines (MG-63 and U2OS) and osteoblast (hFOB) cell line were used in the study. The expression levels of miR-338-3p, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) were altered by transient transfection and determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction/Western blot analysis. Cell viability, colony numbers, migration, and invasion, and apoptotic cells were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry assay, respectively. Dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the target gene of miR-338-3p. Western blot assay was carried to measure the protein expression levels involved in cell apoptosis, migration, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. We found that the expression of miR-338-3p was downregulated in MG-63 cell and U2OS cells, compared with hFOB cells. MiR-338-3p suppression significantly increased cell viability and colony numbers, promoted cell migration, and invasion, but suppressed cell apoptosis in MG-63 and U2OS cells. Opposite results were observed in the miR-338-3p overexpression. Interestingly, RUNX2 and CDK4 were direct target genes of miR-338-3p. RUNX2 inhibition shared a similar effect of miR-338-3p mimic on MG-63 cells. Furthermore, miR-338-3p inhibited the activation of MAPK pathway in MG-63 cells. To conclude, these findings suggested that miR-338-3p functioned as a tumor suppressor in OS cells by targeting RUNX2 and CDK4, as well as inhibition of the MAPK pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Magnetic compression anastomosis is a feasible and effective method for bilioenteric anastomosis (BEA) in animal model. The objective of the present study was to report our initial clinical experience in laparoscopically magnetic compression bilioenteric anastomosis (LMC-BEA). Methods: Patients with obstructive jaundice who were candidates for LMC-BEA were prospectively enrolled from 2013 to 2015. All the procedures were performed laparoscopically. A mother magnet and drainage tube were placed in the proximal bile duct and tightened by a purse suture after dissection of the common bile duct. The drainage tube was introduced into the jejunal lumen at the anastomotic site and guided a daughter magnet to approximate the mother magnet. The two magnets mated at the anastomotic site. All the patients were routinely followed up for magnets discharge till the end of the study. Results: In total, four patients with malignant obstructive jaundice and one patient with benign biliary stricture were included. The median age was 70 y (range, 49-74 y). The median time for LMC-BEA was 12 min (range, 8-15 min). A complete anastomosis was confirmed after a median time of 21 d (range, 5-25 d) postoperatively by cholangiography via drainage tube. The magnets were expulsed around 41 d after surgery (range, 12-47 d) postoperatively. With a median follow-up of 313 d (range, 223-1042 d), no complications associated with magnetic anastomosis was documented, such as bile leakage or anastomotic stricture. Conclusions: Magnetic compression is a promising alternate method for laparoscopic BEA. Among the five patients undergoing LMC-BEA, no one developed anastomotic complications. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In 2011 the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMF) from cell phones as possibly carcinogenic to humans. The National Toxicology Program and the Ramazzini Institute have both reported that RF EMF exposures significantly increase gliomas and Schwannomas of the heart in rodent studies. Recent studies indicate that RF EMF exposures from cell phones have negative impacts on animal cells and cognitive and/or behavioral development in children. Case-control epidemiological studies have found evidence for cell phone use and increased risk for glioma and localization of the glioma associated with the consistent exposure site of regular cell phone use. Understanding the exposure level, or power density, from RF EMF emitted by cell phones under real-world usage and signal reception conditions, as distinct from the published measurements of maximum Specific Absorption Rate values, may help cell phone users decide whether to take behavioral steps to reduce RF EMF exposure. Exposure measurements were conducted on phone models from four major mobile network operators (MNOs) in the USA for calls received under strong and weak reception signal conditions, near the phone face and at several distances up to 48 cm. RF EMF exposure from all phones was found to be greater under weak (1–2 display bars) than under strong (4–5 display bars) reception signal conditions by up to four orders of magnitude. Notably, RF EMF exposure levels under weak reception signal conditions at a distance of 48 cm from the phone were similar to or greater than those detected under strong reception signal conditions at a distance of 4 cm. Under weak reception signal conditions, power density reductions of up to 90% occurred at 16 cm typical for speaker phone or texting over the 4 cm near-ear exposure. The results of this investigation of second-generation (2G) technology suggest that reduced and precautionary use of cell phones under weak signal conditions could lower a user's RF EMF exposure by up to several orders of magnitude. Bluetooth headset power density exposures were 10–400 times lower than those of the cell phones to which they were connected and dependent on the headset rather than the connected phone. The results of this study informed the development of public health guidance regarding cell phone use. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A new water-soluble polysaccharide named BSF-X was extracted and purified from the fruiting bodies of Boletus speciosus Frost which had a molecular weight of 141,309 Da. The structure identification results showed that BSF-X was mainly composed of β-D-glucose and α-D-galactose. BSF-X had a backbone of 1, 4-linked β-D-glucose of which branches were mainly composed of two 1, 6-linked α-D-galactose residue and a 4-linked β-D-glucose at the end of the branches. Antitumor activities results showed that BSF-X could inhibit the proliferation of L929 cells in vitro and S180 tumor cells in vivo. Immunoregulatory activities results showed that BSF-X could promote the proliferation of T cells, B cells and macrophages by promoting the cells into S phase from G0/G1 phase. Polysaccharide BSF-X can also enhance the phagocytes is and cytokine secretion of macrophages. This study introduced the new polysaccharide BSF-X as a valuable source which exhibit unique antitumor and immunoregulatory properties. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Searching for new leads in the battle of cancer will never ends, we herein disclose the design and synthesis of new phthalazine derivatives and their in vitro and in vivo testing for their antiproliferative activity. Phthalazine was selected as a privilege moiety that is incorporated in a big number of anticancer drugs in clinical use or that are still under clinical or preclinical studies. We utilized the drug extension strategy to tailor the designed compounds to fit the EGFR hydrophobic sub pocket and cleft region. The designed phthalazine derivatives was synthesized by linking phthalazine moiety with 1,3,4-oxadiazole-thione and 1,2,4-triazole-thione. Alkylation and glycosylation of the new heterocyclic systems were successfully performed to be used in the drug extension. Coupling of some phthalazine derivatives with different amino acids was also performed to improve the drug selectivity. The synthesized compounds were tested for their antiproliferative activity against cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. The in vitro activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 cell line) ranged from 5.7 µg/mL to 43.4 µg/mL. Compounds 31a and 16 were the most active with an IC 50 5.7 µg/mL and 7.09 µg/mL, respectively compared to the standard compound doxorubicin (4.0 µg/mL). In vivo, compounds 10 and 16 showed IC 50 values 7.25 μg/mL and 7.5 μg/mL, respectively compared to the standard compound cisplatin (IC 50 9.0 μg/mL). In silico, testing of the phthalazine derivatives showed that they are good inhibitors for EGFR. The docking studies substantiated compounds 4, 10, 16 and 31a as new lead compounds and identified Arg841 as a key residue in the cleft region for binding stronger inhibitors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The marketed synthetic (Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV) DPP-IV Inhibitors are expensive antidiabetic drugs and have been reported to cause unacceptable adverse effects such as pancreatitis, angioedema, thyroid and pancreatic cancers. In this scenario research to develop novel DPP-IV Inhibitors from alternative sources is the need of the hour. Hypothesis/purpose: Terminalia arjuna, a medicinal herb with antidiabetic and cardioprotective activities may represent a natural DPP-IV Inhibitor, the DPP-IV Inhibitory activity of which may translate into demonstrable therapeutic benefits in setting of diabetes with cardiovascular co-morbidities. Study design: The study type used for the present study was an experimental (In vitro, In vivo and In silico) design. Method: The DPP-IV Inhibitory, antidiabetic and cardioprotective effects of Terminalia arjuna was evaluated in the experimental model of myocardial infarction co-existing with diabetes. To determine the active principle of Terminalia arjuna responsible for DPP-IV Inhibitory activity, the crystal structure of DPP-IV was considered as receptor which was docked against Arjunetin, Arjungenin, Arjunic acid, Arjunone, Ellagic acid, Gallic acid, Sitagliptin and Vildagliptin. The binding sites as well as affinity of various active ingredients of Terminalia arjuna for DPP- IV enzyme was elucidated using in silico studies and compared to Vildagliptin. Results: Terminalia arjuna demonstrated significant DPP-IV Inhibitory, antidiabetic (significant reduction in HbA1C) and cardioprotective effects (restoration of myocardial CPK-MB) in the experimental model of myocardial infarction co-existing with diabetes. The cardioprotective efficacy correlated to its DPP-IV Inhibitory activity. The active ingredients of Terminalia arjuna (Arjunetin, Arjungenin, Arjunic Acid Arjunone, Ellagic acid and Gallic acid) demonstrated significant inhibition of DPP-IV enzyme. Arjunic acid and Arjunone prefers the active site pocket of DPP-IV enzyme. Compounds like Arjunetin and Vildagliptin prefers to bind near the interface region of the DPP-IV as their biological active forms are homodimer. Sitagliptin binds near the α/β hydrolase domain. Conclusion: The DPP-IV Inhibitory activity of Terminalia arjuna was found to be comparable to Vildagliptin. The DPP-IV Inhibitory activity translated into significant cardioprotective effects in the setting of diabetes. The active ingredient of Terminalia arjuna; Arjunetin, Arjungenin, Ellagic acid and Arjunic acid showed superior DPP-IV Inhibitory activity as compared to synthetic DPP-IV inhibitors (Sitagliptin and Vildagliptin) based on results of docking studies. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH",

    "Abstract": "Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is over expressed in several solid tumors and its inhibition can offer unique target suitable for drug discovery in cancer. A series of 1,2,4-triazoles 3a–3l has been synthesized in good yields and subsequently inhibitory potential of synthesized triazoles 3a–3l against thymidine phosphorylase enzyme was evaluated. Out of these twelve analogs five analogues 3b, 3c, 3f, 3l and 3l exhibited a good inhibitory potential against thymidine phosphorylase. Inhibitory potential in term of IC 50 values were found in the range of 61.98 ± 0.43 to 273.43 ± 0.96 μM and 7-Deazaxanthine was taken as a standard inhibitor with IC 50 = 38.68 ± 4.42 μM. Encouraged by these results, more analogues 1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptocarboxylic acids 4a–4g were synthesized and their inhibitory potential against thymidine phosphorylase was evaluated. In this series, six analogues 4b–4g exhibited a good inhibitory potential in the range of 43.86 ± 1.11–163.43 ± 2.03 μM. Angiogenic response of 1,2,4-triazole acid 4d was estimated using the chick chorionic allantoic membrane (CAM) assay. In the light of these findings, structure activity relationship and molecular docking studies of selected triazoles to determine the key binding interactions was discussed. Docking studies demonstrate that synthesized analogues interacted with active site residues of thymidine phosphorylase enzyme through π-π stacking, thiolate and hydrogen bonding interactions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Transcriptional factor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) has been linked to tumor progression and metastasis, but the mechanisms underlying the effects of Bach1 on tumor growth and metastasis are largely uncharacterized. Here, we report that Bach1 expression was significantly higher in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues than in normal ovarian tissues and that higher levels of Bach1 were associated with tumor stage and poorer overall and progression-free survival. We found that Bach1 enhanced the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, including Slug and Snail, and promoted cell migration by recruiting HMGA2 in the human EOC cell line A2780. Bach1 overexpression enhanced and Bach1 knockout reduced the expression of Slug and the metastasis of EOC cells in a tumor metastasis mouse model. Bach1 expression was positively correlated with Slug and HMGA2 expression in human ovarian cancer tissues. In addition, Bach1 activated p-AKT and p-p70S6K, increased the expression of cyclin D1, and promoted the growth of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and tumor xenografts in vivo. Together, our findings reveal that Bach1 enhances tumor growth and recruits HMGA2 to promote EMT and ovarian cancer metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR) associated with the overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCB1 in cancer cells remains a significant obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, discovering modulators that are capable of inhibiting the drug efflux function or expression of ABCB1 and re-sensitizing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to anticancer agents is of great clinical importance. Regrettably, due to potential adverse events associated with drug-drug interactions and toxicity in patients, researchers have struggled to develop a synthetic inhibitor of ABCB1 that is clinically applicable to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Alternatively, through drug repositioning of approved drugs, we discovered that the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) inhibitor midostaurin blocks the drug transport function of ABCB1 and re-sensitizes ABCB1-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Our findings were further supported by results demonstrating that midostaurin potentiates drug-induced apoptosis in ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cells and inhibits the ATPase activity of ABCB1. Considering that midostaurin is a clinically approved anticancer agent, our findings revealed an additional action of midostaurin and that patients with multidrug-resistant tumors may benefit from a combination therapy of midostaurin with standard chemotherapy, which should be further investigated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway member T-LAK cell–originated protein kinase/PDZ-binding kinase (TOPK/PBK) is closely involved in tumorigenesis and progression. Its overexpression in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) exacerbates tumor malignancy, promotes metastasis and results in dismal prognosis. Therefore, targeting TOPK is a promising approach for CRC therapy. Here, we report the development of a TOPK selective inhibitor SKLB-C05, with subnanomolar inhibitory potency. In vitro, SKLB-C05 exhibited excellent cytotoxicity and anti-migration and invasion activity on TOPK high-expressing CRC cells and induced cell apoptosis. These activities could attribute to its inhibition of TOPK downstream signaling including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, 2, and 3 (JNK1/2/3), as well as downregulation of FAK/Src- MMP signaling. Furthermore, SKLB-C05 disrupted cell mitosis and blocked CRC cell cycle. In vivo, oral administration of SKLB-C05 at concentrations of 20 and 10 mg kg −1 ·day −1 dramatically attenuated CRC tumor xenograft growth and completely suppressed hepatic metastasis of HCT116 cells, respectively. Thus, these findings suggest that SKLB-C05 is a specific TOPK inhibitor with potent anti-CRC oncogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is a wide band-gap semiconductor with excellent optoelectronic properties suitable for photo-sensing devices and photocatalysts. Herein, the ZnS nanowires (ZnS NWs) have been successfully synthesized using thermal evaporation based on vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) method. From the examinations of photosensing device under ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, the photocurrent gain (P g ), responsivity (R λ ), response time and recovery time are 0.572, 2.761 mW/cm 2 , 3.2 s and 3.6 s, respectively. As to photocatalytic activity for methylene blue (MB), the apparent rate coefficient (K) of ZnS NWs is 9.78 × 10 −3 (min −1 ). Although ZnS NWs-based photodetector cannot be workable under ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation, with referring to recent medical literatures, UVB radiation is the major environmental risk factor for developing human skin cancer, the most common cancer worldwide. Thus, the most important contribution in this work is that the ZnS NWs-based UVB radiation-oriented photodetector has been successfully demonstrated via a simple process. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most prevalent central nervous system tumor in children. Targeted treatment approaches for patients with high-risk medulloblastoma are needed as current treatment regimens are not curative in many cases and cause significant therapy-related morbidity. Medulloblastoma harboring MYC amplification have the most aggressive clinical course and worst outcome. Targeting the BET protein BRD4 has significant anti-tumor effects in preclinical models of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma, however, in most cases these are not curative. We here assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the orally bioavailable BRD4 inhibitor, MK-8628, in preclinical models of medulloblastoma. MK-8628 showed therapeutic efficacy against in vitro and in vivo models of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma by inducing apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest. Gene expression analysis of cells treated with MK-8628 showed that anti-tumor effects were accompanied by significant repression of MYC transcription as well as disruption of MYC-regulated transcriptional programs. Additionally, we found that targeting of MYC protein stability through pharmacological PLK1 inhibition showed synergistic anti-medulloblastoma effects when combined with MK-8628 treatment. Thus, MK-8628 is effective against preclinical high-risk medulloblastoma models and its effects can be enhanced through simultaneous targeting of PLK1. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We previously demonstrated that some N-biphenylanilides caused cell-cycle arrest at G2/M transition in breast cancer cells. Among them we choose three derivatives, namely PTA34, PTA73 and RS35 for experimentation in solid tumor cell lines, classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) cell lines and bona fide normal cell lines. Almost all tumor cells were sensitive to compounds in the nanomolar range whereas, they were not cytotoxic to normal ones. Interestingly the compounds caused a strong G2/M phase arrest in cHL cell lines, thus, here we investigated whether they affected the integrity of microtubules in such cells. We found that they induced a long prometaphase arrest, followed by induction of apoptosis which involved mitochondria. PTA73 and RS35 induced the mitotic arrest through the fragmentation of microtubules which prevented the kinethocore-mitotic spindle interaction and the exit from mitosis. PTA34 is instead a tubulin-targeting agent because it inhibited the tubulin polymerization as vinblastine. As such, PTA34 maintained the Cyclin B1-CDK1 regulatory complex activated during the G2/M arrest while inducing the inactivation of Bcl-2 through phosphorylation in Ser70, the degradation of Mcl-1 and a strong activation of BIML and BIMS proapoptotic isoforms. In addition PTA34 exerted an antiangiogenic effect by suppressing microvascular formation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the importance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in initiation and progression of various cancers, including prostate cancer. LncRNA SAP30L-AS1 is previously identified in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. In this study, we further investigated the expression of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we explored the biological roles and mechanisms of action of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer. The expression of SAP30L-AS1 is found to be increased in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues and normal prostate epithelial cell line, respectively. Increased expression of SAP30L-AS1 is associated with greater Gleason score, advanced pathological T stage, and poor over survival of prostate cancer patients. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of SAP30L-AS1 promotes prostate cancer proliferation and inhibits prostate cancer apoptosis. SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer proliferation and induces prostate cancer apoptosis. Furthermore, SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigation revealed that SAP30L-AS1 physically binds to the promoter of SAP30L and represses SAP30L expression. The expression of SAP30L is negatively associated with that of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues. Rescue assays demonstrated that overexpression of SAP30L attenuated the roles of SAP30L-AS1 in promoting prostate cancer proliferation and inhibiting prostate cancer apoptosis. In conclusion, SAP30L-AS1 is upregulated and has oncogenic roles in prostate cancer via repressing SAP30L. Our data suggest that SAP30L-AS1 may be a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Wnt signaling pathway plays a major role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Small molecules which can cut off this signal transduction can be promising anti-cancer drugs for CRC therapy. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of FH535, an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, on inhibiting proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells DLD-1 and SW620. We found that FH535 could significantly suppress the growth of DLD-1 and SW620 cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. The results of cell cycle tests showed that FH535 could significantly induce G2/M arrest in colorectal cancer cells. Transwell and Wound-healing assays revealed that FH535 notably inhibited cell migration. Moreover, we found that FH535 down-regulated β-catenin and CyclinA2 expressions while up-regulating Claudin-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, which may contribute to the FH535-induced inhibitory effect on proliferation and migration in human colorectal cancer cells. Our study revealed that FH535 inhibited proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells by regulating CyclinA2 and Claudin1 gene expression, which enriches regulatory network of FH535 and may contribute to being promising anti-cancer drugs for CRC therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Molecular markers are urgently needed to select non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients most likely to benefit from platinum-based chemotherapies. Of particular interest are proteins that can be found in biofluids like sputum for non-invasive detection. Therefore, we profiled the secretomes of 6 NSCLC cell lines with varying IC50-values for cisplatin, using label-free GeLC-MS/MS-based proteomics. Out of a total dataset of 2610 proteins, 304 proteins showed significant differences in expression levels between cisplatin sensitive and insensitive cell lines. Functional data mining revealed that the secretion of typically extracellular factors was associated with a higher sensitivity towards cisplatin, while cisplatin insensitivity correlated with increased secretion of theoretically intra-cellular proteins. Stringent statistical analysis and quantitative filtering yielded 58 biomarker candidates, 34 of which could be detected in clinical biofluids of lung cancer patients such as sputum using label-free LC-MS/MS-based proteomics. To assess performance of these biofluid biomarker candidates, we correlated protein expression with patient survival using a publically available clinical gene expression data set (GSE14814). We thus identified 3 top candidates with potential predictive value in determining cisplatin response (UGGT1, COL6A1 and MAP4) for future development as non-invasive biomarkers to guide treatment decisions. Significance: Platinum-based chemotherapies are still the standard of care for NSCLC and other lung cancer types in the clinic today. However, due to chemoresistance, many patients suffer from the toxic side effects of these treatments without gaining any benefit in terms of survival. To date, no molecular biomarkers are available to predict clinical outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy. Because proteins present the functional read-out of genetic, epigenetic and translational events in the cell, a protein test is likely to be particularly suitable for response prediction. Of high relevance are proteins that are shed or secreted from cells, for example at primary tumor sites, and can be found in easily accessible biofluids like sputum for non-invasive detection. Here, we report the proteome profiling of the conditioned media (secretomes) of a panel of NSCLC cell lines in relation to cisplatin IC50 values, as a pre-clinical model, and of patient sputum as a clinical, lung cancer relevant biofluid. Using this approach in conjunction with exploration of the predictive potential in a transcriptome lung cancer patient dataset, we reveal biofluid biomarker candidates that, with further validation, may be used for non-invasive cisplatin response prediction in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Biomarkers for early detection of ovarian tumors are urgently needed. Tumors of the ovary grow within cysts and most are benign. Surgical sampling is the only way to ensure accurate diagnosis, but often leads to morbidity and loss of female hormones. The present study explored the deep proteome in well-defined sets of ovarian tumors, FIGO stage I, Type 1 (low-grade serous, mucinous, endometrioid; n = 9), Type 2 (high-grade serous; n = 9), and benign serous (n = 9) using TMT–LC–MS/MS. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010939. We evaluated new bioinformatics tools in the discovery phase. This innovative selection process involved different normalizations, a combination of univariate statistics, and logistic model tree and naive Bayes tree classifiers. We identified 142 proteins by this combined approach. One biomarker panel and nine individual proteins were verified in cyst fluid and serum: transaldolase-1, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA), transketolase, ceruloplasmin, mesothelin, clusterin, tenascin-XB, laminin subunit gamma-1, and mucin-16. Six of the proteins were found significant (p <.05) in cyst fluid while ALDOA was the only protein significant in serum. The biomarker panel achieved ROC AUC 0.96 and 0.57 respectively. We conclude that classification algorithms complement traditional statistical methods by selecting combinations that may be missed by standard univariate tests. Significance: In the discovery phase, we performed deep proteome analyses of well-defined histology subgroups of ovarian tumor cyst fluids, highly specified for stage and type (histology and grade). We present an original approach to selecting candidate biomarkers combining several normalization strategies, univariate statistics, and machine learning algorithms. The results from validation of selected proteins strengthen our prior proteomic and genomic data suggesting that cyst fluids are better than sera in early stage ovarian cancer diagnostics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "As an innovative CXC chemokine, CXCL17 has a mysterious clinical significance and modulating influence on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study examined the activity and mechanisms of CXCL17 on growth, autophagy, and metastasis of HCC. Upregulation of CXCL17 expression was observed in HCC, which is correlated with poorer histological stages and outcomes. Elevation of CXCL17 expression promoted proliferation, invasion, and migration and decreased LC-3B biosynthesis and p62 protein reduction, which are known to stimulate autophagy. However, silencing of CXCL17 inhibited the development of these cancerous phenotypes. Furthermore, AMPK was stimulated after knockdown of CXCL17. This stimulation, as well as stimulation of autophagy was caused by liver kinase B1 (LKB1), whose function is induced by knockdown CXCL17. Additionally, knockdown of CXCL17 enhanced nuclear translocation of LKB1. Altogether, these findings suggest that elevated CXCL17 expression in HCC promotes malignant reactions in malignant cells. Our research offers new evidence that chemokine CXCL17 reinforces malignant invasion and suppresses autophagy via the LKB1-AMPK pathway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enterodiol (END) is transformed by human intestinal bacteria from lignans contained in various whole-grain cereals, nuts, legumes, flaxseed, and vegetables. It is known to have several physiological effects, but its effects on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and apoptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells have not yet been elucidated. We therefore investigated the effects of END on apoptosis in CRC cells and whether these effects are mediated via MAPK signaling. RESULTS: Cell proliferation was decreased by END treatment in a time-dependent manner. In particular, END treatment resulted in an apoptosis rate of up to 40% in CT26 cells but showed no cytotoxicity toward RAW264.7 macrophages. Treatment with END also suppressed the migration of CRC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 was down-regulated with END treatment. Furthermore, END decreased the expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins in CRC cells. CONCLUSION: Enterodiol inhibited the growth of CRC cells by controlling the MAPK signaling pathway involved in proliferation and apoptosis. These results demonstrate that END has an apoptotic effect in CRC cells. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",

    "Abstract": "Acute pain from mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing radiation therapy (RT) is common, and may not respond well to narcotics. We used low resolution electromagnetic tomography z-score neurofeedback (LFBz) to investigate whether patients could modify brain wave activity associated with acute pain and whether this would reduce the experience of pain. HNC patients scheduled for RT had baseline pre-pain onset measures (EEG and numeric rating scale) collected before RT and then at pain onset before using analgesics, after each LFBz session and at the end of RT. Up to six sessions of LFBz training were offered over the remaining RT. Up to six 20-min sessions of LFBz were offered over the remaining RT. Data were collected before and after each LFBz session and at the end of RT. Seventeen patients recruited; fourteen were treated and reported decreased pain perception. LFBz allowed patients to modify their brain activity in predesignated areas of the pain matrix toward the direction of their baseline, pre-pain condition (including Brodmann areas (BAs) 3, 4, 5, 13, 24, and 33). LFBz can modify brain regions relevant for pain and these changes were associated with self-reported decreases in pain perception. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Extracellular cystine (CYC) uptake by xC − antiporter is important for the cell viability. Especially in cancer cells, the upregulation of xC − activity is observed, which protects these cells from intracellular oxidative stress. Hence, inhibition of the CYC uptake may eventually lead to cancer cell death. Up to now, the molecular level mechanism of the CYC uptake by xC − antiporter has not been studied in detail. In this study, we applied several different simulation techniques to investigate the transport of CYC through xCT, the light subunit of the xC − antiporter, which is responsible for the CYC and glutamate translocation. Specifically, we studied the permeation of CYC across three model systems, i.e., outward facing (OF), occluded (OCC) and inward facing (IF) configurations of xCT. We also investigated the effect of mutation of Cys 327 to Ala within xCT, which was also studied experimentally in literature. This allowed us to qualitatively compare our computation results with experimental observations, and thus, to validate our simulations. In summary, our simulations provide a molecular level mechanism of the transport of CYC across the xC − antiporter, more specifically, which amino acid residues in the xC − antiporter play a key role in the uptake, transport and release of CYC. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Herein, we perform the regioselective acetylation of phloridzin catalyzed by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB). We show that the enzyme amount and reaction time can significantly influence the composition of mono-, di- and tri-acetylated phloridzin in the product. The last acetylated derivative of phloridzin is isolated and identified as 4, 3″ 6″-3-O-acetyl-phloridzin by HPLC, UV, IR, MS and NMR. Molecular docking suggests that the first acetylation of phloridzin catalyzed by CALB occurs in 6″-OH, followed by 3″-OH, then 4-OH. During this process, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic forces play an important role in maintaining the binding interaction of CALB with phloridzin or its acetylated derivatives. Although, tri-acetylated phloridzin has moderate to minimal adverse-effects on LO-2, its anti-proliferative activity against human HepG2 cancer cells is superior to that of phloridzin, which attributes to its high capacity of inducing cell apoptosis, retarding cell cycle, lowering mitochondrial membrane potential and scavenging intracellular ROS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Cell surface proteins are responsible for many critical functions. Systematical profiling of these proteins would provide a unique molecular fingerprint to classify cells and provide important information to guide immunotherapy. Cell surface biotinylation method is one of the effective methods for cell surface proteome profiling. However, classical workflows suffer the disadvantage of poor sensitivity. In this work, we presented an optimized protocol which enabled identification of more cell surface proteins from a smaller number of cells. When this protocol was combined with a tip based fractionation scheme, 4510 proteins, including 2055 annotated cell surface-associated proteins, were identified with only 20 microgram protein digest, showing the superior sensitivity of the approach. To enable process 10 times fewer cells, a pipet tip based protocol was developed, which led to the identification of about 600 cell surface-associated proteins. Finally, the new protocol was applied to compare the cell surface proteomes of two breast cancer cell lines, BT474 and MCF7. It was found that many cell surface-associated proteins were differentially expressed. The new protocols were demonstrated to be easy to perform, time-saving, and yielding good selectivity and high sensitivity. We expect this protocol would have broad applications in the future. Significance: Cell surface proteins confer specific cellular functions and are easily accessible. They are often used as drug targets and potential biomarkers for prognostic or diagnostic purposes. Thus, efficient methods for profiling cell surface proteins are highly demanded. Cell surface biotinylation method is one of the effective methods for cell surface proteome profiling. However, classical workflows suffer the disadvantage of poor sensitivity. In this work, we presented an optimized protocol which enabled identification of more cell surface proteins from a smaller number of starting cells. The new protocol is easier to perform, time-saving and has less protein loss. By using a special pipet tip, sensitive and in-depth cell surface proteome analysis could be achieved. In combination with label-free quantitative MS, the new protocol can be applied to the differential analysis of the cell surface proteomes between different cell lines to find genetically- or drug-induced changes. We expect this protocol would have broad application in cell surface protein studies, including the discovery of diagnostic marker proteins and potential therapeutic targets. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative reactions are responsible for the changes in quality during food processing and storage. Oxidative stress is also involved in multiple chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, and aging. The consumption of dietary antioxidants has been demonstrated to help to reduce the oxidative damage in both the human body and food systems. In this study, the potential of Erythrina edulis (pajuro) protein as source of antioxidant peptides was evaluated. RESULTS: Pajuro protein concentrate hydrolyzed by alcalase for 120 min showed potent ABTS ·+ and peroxyl radical scavenging activity with Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values of 1.37 ± 0.09 µmol TE mg −1 peptide and 2.83 ± 0.07 µmol TE mg −1 peptide, respectively. Fractionation of the hydrolyzate to small peptides resulted in increased antioxidant activity. De novo sequencing of most active fractions collected by chromatographic analysis enabled 30 novel peptides to be identified. Of these, ten were synthesized and their radical activity evaluated, demonstrating their relevant contribution to the antioxidant effects observed for pajuro protein hydrolyzate. CONCLUSIONS: The sequences identified represent an important advance in the molecular characterization of the pajuro protein, demonstrating its potential as a source of antioxidant peptides for food and nutraceutical applications. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",

    "Abstract": "Drug-loading on magnetic nanoparticles coated with biocompatible polymers are intriguing nanostructures for targeted delivery of anticancer drugs with the application of a magnetic field. In this paper, we report the preparation of SmFeO3 nanoparticles and loading of the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil on the carrier by forming host–guest complex with β-cyclodextrin. The material and the polymer are characterized using IR and EDX spectroscopic techniques. The nanocarrier formulation shows an enhanced loading and release of the drug. The size and the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles are suitable for cancer drug targeting, i.e., around 50 nm, and the particles show a superparamagnetic behavior. In vitro cytotoxicity studies reveal that the loaded 5-fluorouracil retains its potency and the drug-loaded nanocarrier shows better anticancer activity. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "BRMS1 is a 246-residue-long protein belonging to the family of metastasis suppressors. It is a predominantly nuclear protein, although it can also function in the cytoplasm. At its C terminus, it has a region that is predicted to be a nuclear localization sequence (NLS); this region, NLS2, is necessary for metastasis suppression. We have studied in vitro and in silico the conformational preferences in aqueous solution of a peptide (NLS2-pep) that comprises the NLS2 of BRMS1, to test whether it has a preferred conformation that could be responsible for its function. Our spectroscopic (far-UV circular dichroism, DOSY-NMR and 2D-NMR) and computational (all-atom molecular dynamics) results indicate that NLS2-pep was disordered in aqueous solution. Furthermore, it did not acquire a structure even when experiments were performed in a more hydrophobic environment, such as the one provided by 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). The hydrodynamic radius of the peptide in water was identical to that of a random-coil sequence, in agreement with both our molecular simulations and other theoretical predictions. Thus, we suggest that NLS2 is a disordered region, with non pre-formed structure, that participates in metastasis suppression. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To explore the feasibility of using mesothelin (MESO) as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and its function in the development of cervical cancer. Methods: We collected eight cervical tissue samples of squamous cell carcinoma as the test group and eight samples of cervicitis as the control group from patients who underwent a hysterectomy because of a diagnosis of myoma. Then we used western blotting to screen for a potential TAA in cervical squamous cell carcinoma samples. In addition, Lentivirus-mediated RNAi was used to downregulate the expression of the MESO gene (MSLN) in SiHa cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), 3‑(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z‑y1)‑3,5‑di‑phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT), and wound healing were used to examine cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell migration respectively. Results: Results of the western blotting showed that the MESO protein expressed highly in the cervical squamous cell carcinoma and paracancerous tissues in contrast to the cervicitis tissue (p = 0.242). We used quantitative PCR to verify that the expression of MSLN was 21.6% in the cells undergoing knockdown compared to that in the control cells, and thus, decided to continue with further experiments. We confirmed by FACS that the apoptosis rate in the SiHa cell group undergoing MSLN knockdown (KD group) was significantly higher than that in negative control (NC) group of SiHa cells (p = 0.014). The proliferation of cells was examined by MTT and the difference between the KD and NC groups was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.002). However, since the difference was <20% we did not consider it to be clinically significant. Cell migration ability was verified by wound healing test and found to be 43% in the KD group and 38% in the NC group after 48 h, but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions: MESO might be used as a TAA for diagnosing cervical squamous cell carcinoma. When MSLN was knocked down in SiHa cells, cell apoptosis increased, but no significant effects were observed on cell proliferation and migration. Thus, our study shows that MSLN plays a role in the apoptosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma cells, and since this might affect tumor progression, further research is warranted to understand how MSLN plays this role. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "The non-isothermal autohydrolysis temperature impact of edible brown seaweed Laminaria ochroleuca was studied to recover high valuable compounds. Extraction yield was determined, above 80% was obtained at 220 °C. The maximal fucose content (17% d.b.) was attained at 180 °C, whereas the maximal sulphate was achieved at 160 °C, and phenolic and protein content at 220 °C. The maximum sulphated fucoidan content (41.38 g fucoidan/100 g extract) was obtained at 160 °C, whereas the maximum fucose oligosaccharides was obtained at 180 °C. The antioxidant capacity was equivalent to 32 mg Trolox/g dry extract produced at 220 °C. The milder processing condition was selected to study the potentiality of the precipitated alginate in terms of viscoelastic properties determined by rheology. Alginate extraction (14.94 g/100 g extract) was determined at 160 °C. The crude fucoidan fractions were tested at 25–500 μg/mL, showed up to 50% cell growth inhibition in four selected tumoral cell lines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "This study aims to investigate whether circ-HIPK3 could promote the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells by upregulating STAT3 after binding to miR-124-3p, thus participating in the development of glioma. Expression levels of circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3 in glioma cell lines were determined using qRT-PCR. The regulatory effects of circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3 on proliferative and invasive capacities of glioma cells were accessed using EdU assay, CCK-8 assay and invasion assay, respectively. Cell cycle assay and cell apoptosis assay were performed by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to determine the binding condition among circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3. Rescue experiments were performed in co-transfected glioma cells. QRT-PCR data showed that circ-HIPK3 and STAT3 are highly expressed, whereas miR-124-3p is lowly expressed in glioma cells than those of negative control cell. Knockdown of circ-HIPK3 in U87 and U251 cells inhibited their proliferative and invasive capacities. On the contrary, miR-124-3p knockdown improved proliferative and migratory capacities. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay exerted that circ-HIPK3 could bind to miR-124-3p and STAT3 is the target gene of miR-124-3p. Western blot results elucidated that circ-HIPK3 stabilizes STAT3 expression, whereas miR-124-3p degrades STAT3 expression. Rescue experiments demonstrated that overexpression of circ-HIPK3 could partially reverse the inhibited proliferative and migratory capacities induced by miR-124-3p in U87 and U251 cells. In summary, we found that overexpression of circ-HIPK3 promotes proliferative and invasive capacities of glioma cells by sponging miR-124-3p to upregulate STAT3 expression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Genetic variations among HR-HPV types lead to altered biological functions with possible clinical significance in different geographical locations. To explore intratype genetic variations of HPV51 E6, E7, L1 and L2 genes originating from Southwest China, a total of 5204 cervical scraped cell samples were collected for DNA extraction and HPV typing. And then the E6, E7, L1 and L2 genes of HPV51 (n = 79) were sequenced and compared to the reference sequence (M62877). The ConSurf server was used for identification of conserved structural and functional amino acids of the E6 and E7 oncogenes, and the changes of the secondary structure were analyzed by PSIPred software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method implemented in IQ-TREE. The selection pressure acting on the E6, E7, L1 and L2 genes was estimated by Datamonkey web server. 13 nucleotide polymorphism sites were observed in E6-E7 gene and the most common mutation sites were C395T (S100L), C756T (S66L), C796T, A832G. 36 nucleotide polymorphism sites were identified in full length L1 gene and the non-synonymous mutations T6311G, A6312T (V264G), G6313A (G265S) A5674C (I52L), A6335C (N272T), A6586C (T354P) and synonymous mutations A5649T, C6147T, A6435G, G6570A, A6651G, T6774C, A6784C, A6882G, C6918A, and G6984A were the most common mutations. 53 nucleotide variation sites were identified in full-length L2 gene including four insertion sites (4418A, 4670G, 4693A, 4694C) and one deletion site (A4430). Besides, the non-synonymous mutations G4227A (V32I), A4407G (I92V), G4945A (D271N), C4985A (T284K), T5260G (L376V), A5335C (T401P) and the synonymous mutations A4166G, G4229A, G4283A, T4453C, C4566A, T4596C, C4695T, C4830T, G4839A, A5160C, and T5286G were the most common mutations. Specially, a triallelic mutation site (G4461C/A) in L2 was identified, with 26% G4461C (E109D) being non-synonymous mutation. Selective pressure analysis showed that only codon site 66 in E7 and 52 in L1 were the positively selected sites and codon sites 72, 107, 342, 412, 427 were negatively selected sites in L2 gene. Our investigation also suggests that A2 and A4 were the most frequent HPV51 lineage in Southwest China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI, or RMP, a member of the prefoldin family of molecular chaperones) exhibits oncogenic activity in several types of cancer, including ovarian cancer. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism in ovarian cancer remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate gene expression, and their dysregulation has been implicated in tumorigenesis. To elucidate the role of miRNAs in URI-induced ovarian cancer, miR-598 and URI were overexpressed in the SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line. The CCK8 kit was used to determine cell proliferation, and the Transwell assay was used to measure cell invasion and migration. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to analyze the expression of miR-598 and URI, and the luciferase reporter assay was used to examine the interaction between miR-598 and URI. Nude mice were used to characterize the regulation of tumor growth in vivo. The results showed that the expression of miR-598 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of ovarian cancer cells by targeting URI. The inhibitory effect of miR-598 was reversed by overexpression of URI. The luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-598 downregulated URI by directly targeting the 3′ UTR of URI. In vivo studies showed that the expression of miR-598 significantly inhibited the growth of tumors. Taken together, the results suggested that miR-598 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis by targeting URI. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin inhibits development of colitis-associated colon cancer. However, the role of cathelicidin in colon cancer metastasis remains unknown. We hypothesized that cathelicidin is effective in inhibiting colon cancer metastasis. Human colon cancer HT-29 cells were injected intravenously into nude mice. Control HA-tagged adeno-associated virus (HA-AAV) or cathelicidin-overexpressing AAV (CAMP-HA-AAV) were injected intravenously into nude mice on the same day. Four weeks later, the nude mice were assessed for lung and liver metastases. Human colon cancer SW620 cells were used to study the effect of cathelicidin on cell migration and cytoskeleton. Incubation of SW620 cells with cathelicidin dose-dependently reduced cell migration, disrupted cytoskeletal structure, and reduced βIII-tubulin (TUBB3) mRNA expression. The addition of the P2RX7 antagonist KN62, but not the FPRL1 antagonist WRW4, prevented the LL-37-mediated inhibition of cell migration and TUBB3 mRNA expression. The CAMP-HA-AAV-overexpressing group showed significantly reduced human CK20 protein (by 60%) and TUBB3 mRNA expression (by 40%) in the lungs and liver of the HT-29-loaded nude mice, compared to the HA-AAV control group. Intraperitoneal injection of KN62 reversed the CAMP-HA-AAV-mediated inhibition of human CK20 and TUBB3 expression in the lungs and liver of HT-29-loaded nude mice. In conclusion, cathelicidin inhibits colon cancer metastasis via a P2RX7-dependent pathway. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and treatment, cancer remains the major reason for mortality worldwide. The Runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family has been reported to participate in diverse human diseases. However, little is known about their expression and prognostic values in human leukemia. Herein, we conducted a detailed cancer versus normal analysis. The mRNA expression levels of the RUNX family in various kinds of cancers, including leukemia, were analyzed via the ONCOMINE and GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) databases. We observed that the mRNA expression levels of RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3 were all increased in most cancers compared with normal tissues, especially in leukemia. Moreover, the expression levels of RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3 are also highly expressed in almost all cancer cell lines, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, analyzed by Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) databases. Further, the LinkedOmics and GEPIA databases were used to evaluate the prognostic values. In survival analyses based on LinkedOmics, higher expression of RUNX1 and RUNX2 indicated a better overall survival (OS), but with no significance, whereas increased RUNX3 revealed a poor OS in leukemia. In addition, the GEPIA dataset was also used to perform survival analyses, and results manifested that the expression of RUNX1 and RUNX2 had no remarkable correction with OS in leukemia, but it showed highly expressed RUNX3 was significantly related with poor OS in leukemia. In conclusion, the RUNX family showed significant expression differences between cancer and normal tissues, especially leukemia, and RUNX3 could be a promising prognostic biomarker for leukemia. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising approach for treating recurrent and/or drug-resistant ovarian cancer. However, its successful application in the clinic has been hampered by rapid immune-mediated clearance or neutralization of the virus, which reduces viral access to tumor foci. To overcome this barrier, patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been used to deliver virus to tumors, but variability associated with autologous cell isolations prevents this approach from being broadly clinically applicable. Here, we demonstrate the ability of an allogeneic, clonal neural stem cell (NSC) line (HB1.F3.CD21) to protect oncolytic viral cargo from neutralizing antibodies within patient ascites fluid and to deliver it to tumors within preclinical peritoneal ovarian metastases models. The viral payload used is a conditionally replication-competent adenovirus driven by the survivin promoter (CRAd-S-pk7). Because the protein survivin is highly expressed in ovarian cancer, but not in normal differentiated cells, viral replication should occur selectively in ovarian tumor cells. We found this viral agent was effective against cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumors and could be used as an adjunct treatment with cisplatin to decrease tumor burden without increasing toxicity. Collectively, our data suggest NSC-delivered CRAd-S-pk7 virotherapy holds promise for improving clinical outcome, reducing toxicities, and improving quality of life for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Upregulation of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) is often observed in different types of cancers, including gastric cancer (GC), but the association of elevated HE4 level with radiation resistance in GC remains unclear. The expression of HE4 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α subunit (HIF1α) was assessed in GC patient samples and cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were performed to reveal the regulation between HE4 and HIF1α. Stable HE4 knockdown and HIF1α overexpression were introduced into GC cell lines to study the role of HE4 in the resistance of GC to radiation therapy. Colony formation assay and the xenograft mouse model were used to investigate the effects of radiation on GC cells. HE4 and HIF1α were upregulated in both GC patient tissues and GC cells. Hypoxia and HIF1α upregulated HE4 by directly targeting the hypoxia response element in its promoter region. Stable HE4 knockdown significantly sensitized GC cells and xenograft tumors to radiation. HIF1α overexpression markedly elevated the radiation resistance of GC cells, which was almost completely abolished by HE4 knockdown. Hypoxia-induced upregulation of HE4 is responsible for resistance to radiation therapy of GC, suggesting that HE4 knockdown or inhibition, combined with radiation therapy, holds great potential in the clinical treatment of GC. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a human glycoprotein involved in cellular adhesion and expressed during human fetal development. Although expression of CEA largely ceases prior to birth, several human epithelial cancers, including colorectal, gastric, squamous esophageal, and breast carcinomas have been known to overexpress CEA, suggesting its potential as an immunotherapeutic target. Using a transgenic mouse model constitutively expressing human CEA in a spatiotemporal manner as a self-protein and a syngeneic mouse colon cancer cell line, MC38-CEA, overexpressing CEA, we tested the potential of a novel genetic immunotherapy approach against CEA-expressing tumors, using recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding CEA (rAAV-CEA) and appropriately timed immune adjuvant application. Results of the study demonstrated breaking of immune tolerance for CEA with this vaccine regimen and an anti-tumor response, resulting in tumor-free survival. Furthermore, tumor challenge of CEA-vaccinated mice with parental MC38 cells not expressing CEA did not result in protection from tumor development, confirming that the protection against tumor development is CEA specific. The study illustrates the feasibility of utilizing rAAV vectors in combination with an immunostimulatory adjuvant to break tolerance to weakly immunogenic self-antigens and for an anti-tumor response. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Selective targeting of drugs to tumor cells is a key goal in oncology. Here, we performed an in vivo phage display to identify peptides that specifically target xenografted prostate cancer cells. This yielded three peptide candidates, LN1 (C-TGTPARQ-C), LN2 (C-KNSMFAT-C), and LN3 (C-TNKHSPK-C); each of these peptides was synthesized and evaluated for binding and biological activity. LN1 showed the highest avidity for LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro and was thus administered to tumor-bearing mice to evaluate in vivo binding. Strikingly, LN1 specifically bound to the tumor tissue and exhibited very low reactivity with normal liver and kidney tissues. To demonstrate that LN1 could specifically deliver drugs to prostate cancer tissue, a therapeutic peptide, LN1-KLA (C-TGTPARQ-C-GGG-D[KLAKLAK]2), was prepared and used to treat LNCaP cells in vitro and was also administered to tumor-bearing mice. The therapeutic peptide significantly suppressed growth of the cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our study shows that a selective homing peptide strategy could facilitate cell-specific targeting of therapeutics while avoiding adverse reactions in normal tissues. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant expression of zinc-finger proteins has been extensively reported to contribute to malignant progression in a variety of cancers. However, clinical significance and biological roles of ZNF280A in the field of cancer are poorly known. In this study, the expression of ZNF280A was detected in clinical colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. Functional experiments in vitro and animal experiment in vivo were performed to measure the effect of ZNF280A on the proliferation and tumorigenesis in CRC cells. Western blot and luciferase assays were used to identify the underlying pathway mediating the biological roles of ZNF280A in CRC. Here we report that ZNF280A was upregulated in CRC tissues and cells and a high expression of ZNF280A correlated with tumor, lymph node, and metastasis (TNM) classifications, clinical stage, and predicted poor prognosis and disease progression in CRC patients. Moreover, silencing ZNF280A repressed proliferation and induced G0 and/or G1 arrest in vitro, and it inhibited tumorigenesis of CRC cells in vivo. Our results further demonstrate that silencing ZNF280A inhibited the proliferation of CRC cells by activating Hippo signaling. Therefore, our results uncover a novel mechanistic understanding of ZNF280A-mediated tumor progression in CRC, and meanwhile they provide a novel prognostic factor in CRC patients and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Nitidine chloride (NC) has been demonstrated to exert a tumor-suppressive function in various types of human cancers. However, the detailed mechanism of NC-mediated anti-tumor effects remains elusive. It has been reported that SIN1, a component of mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex C2), plays an oncogenic role in a variety of human cancers. Therefore, the inhibition of SIN1 could be useful for the treatment of human cancers. In this study, we explored whether NC triggered an anti-cancer function via the inhibition of SIN1 in osteosarcoma (OS) cells. An MTT assay was performed to measure the effect of NC on the cell growth of osteosarcoma cells, and flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptotic rate of the cells after NC treatment. The expression of SIN1 was detected by western blotting. Wound-healing assay and Transwell chamber invasion assay were conducted to analyze the motility of osteosarcoma cells following NC exposure. We found that exposure to NC led to the inhibition of cell growth, migration, and invasion and the induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, we found that NC inhibited the expression of SIN1 in osteosarcoma cells. Overexpression of SIN1 abrogated the inhibition of cell growth and motility induced by NC in osteosarcoma cells. Our results indicate that NC exhibits its tumor-suppressive activity via the inhibition of SIN1 in osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that NC could be a potential inhibitor of SIN1 in osteosarcoma. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Oncolytic virotherapies have emerged as new modalities for cancer treatment. We previously reported that coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a novel oncolytic virus (OV) with a strong ability to lyse human non-small cell lung cancer cells; however, its non-specific toxicity against normal cells remains to be resolved. To improve its safety profile, microRNA target sequences complementary to miR-34a/c, which is expressed preferentially in normal cells, were inserted into the 5′ UTR or 3′ UTR of the CVB3 genome. In the presence of miR-34a/c, the gene-modified CVB3 could not replicate in normal cells. We also found that the pathogenicity of CVB3 was reduced to a greater extent by targeting miR-34a than miR-34c; in addition, it was more effective to insert the target sequences into the 3′ UTR rather than the 5′ UTR of the viral genome. Ultimately, we developed a double-miR-34a targeting virus (53a-CVB) by inserting miR-34a targets in both the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR of the virus. 53a-CVB was minimally toxic to cells in normal tissue, but maintained nearly its full oncolytic activity in mice xenografted with human lung cancer. 53a-CVB is the first miR-34-regulated OV and represents a promising platform for the development of safe and effective anti-cancer therapies. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been found to exert its anti-cancer activity in various human malignancies. In our previous report, we have shown that ATO inhibited cell growth and invasion via downregulation of Skp2 in pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. It has been extensively demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. ATO might induce PC cell apoptosis and regulate Skp2 downregulation through the regulation of miRNAs. One study has demonstrated that miR-330-5p exerts a tumor-suppressive function in PC cell lines. Here, we investigated the role of miRNA-330-5p in ATO-mediated anti-tumor activity and explored whether ATO could regulate miR-330-5p in PC cells. We found that ATO treatment upregulated the expression of miR-330-5p. Moreover, miR-330-5p inhibitor rescued the ATO-mediated tumor-suppressive function. The combination of miR-330-5p mimic with ATO reduced cell growth, motility, and invasion, and enhanced apoptosis to a greater degree in PC cells. This study suggests that the combination of miR-330-5p mimic with ATO may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PC. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Previous studies showed that the COpper Metabolism gene MURR1 Domain (COMMD) family of proteins was abnormally expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to explore the roles of COMMD1 and COMMD7 in regulating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in HCC stem cells (HCSCs). In vivo, the expression of COMMD7 and COMMD1 was determined in 35 pairs of HCC cancer tissues and adjacent tissues, and the effect of COMMD7 silencing on xenograft tumor growth was evaluated. In vitro, the effects of COMMD7 silencing and COMMD1 overexpression on HCSC function were assessed. Results found that the expression levels of COMMD7 were higher, whereas COMMD1 levels were lower in HCC tissues and HCSCs. COMMD7 silencing or COMMD1 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through suppression of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, COMMD7 positively regulated NF-κB by upregulating protein inhibitor for activated stat 4 (PIAS4). This study demonstrates that COMMD7 has a dual regulatory role in the NF-κB signaling pathway in Nanog + HCSCs. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Clinical efficacy of redifferentiation therapy with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) for lethal radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer (RR-PTC) is urgently needed to be improved. Given that the impairment of histone acetylation is a mechanism in BRAF V600E -mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-induced aberrant silencing of thyroid iodine-metabolizing genes, dual inhibition of HDAC and MAPK may produce a more favorable effect. In this study, we treated BRAF V600E -mutant (BCPAP and K1) and BRAF-wild-type (BHP 2-7) cells with HDACi (panobinostat) and MAPK inhibitor (dabrafenib or selumetinib), alone or in combination, and we tested the expression of iodine- and glucose-metabolizing genes, radioiodine uptake and efflux, and toxicity. We found that panobinostat alone increased iodine-metabolizing gene expression, promoted radioiodine uptake and toxicity, and suppressed GLUT1 expression in all the cells. However, MAPKi (dabrafenib or selumetinib) induced these effects only in BRAF V600E -mutant cells. Combined treatment with panobinostat and MAPKi (dabrafenib or selumetinib) displayed a more robust BRAF V600E -dependent redifferentiation effect than panobinostat alone via further improving the acetylation level of histone at the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) promoter. In conclusion, MAPK inhibitors enhance HDACi-induced redifferentiation in PTC cells harboring BRAF V600E , warranting animal and clinical trials. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Rexin-G is a replication-incompetent retroviral vector displaying a cryptic SIG-binding peptide for targeting abnormal Signature (SIG) proteins in tumors and encoding a dominant-negative human cyclin G1 construct. Herein we report on the safety and antitumor activity of escalating doses of Rexin-G in gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with one 10-year survivor. For the safety analysis (n = 20), treatment-related grade 1 adverse events included fatigue (n = 6), chills (n = 2), and headache (n = 1), with no organ damage and no DLT. No patient tested positive for vector-neutralizing antibodies, antibodies to gp70, replication-competent retrovirus (RCR), or vector integration into genomic DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). For the efficacy analysis (n = 15), one patient achieved a complete response (CR), two patients had a partial response (PR), and 12 had stable disease (SD). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7, 4.0, and 5.6 months at doses 0–I, II, and III, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) and 1-year OS rate at dose 0–I were 4.3 months and 0%, and at dose II–III they were 9.2 months and 33.3%. To date, one patient is still alive with no evidence of cancer 10 years after the start of Rexin-G treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that Rexin-G, the first targeted gene delivery system, is uniquely safe and exhibits significant antitumor activity, for which the FDA granted fast-track designation. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "HMGB1 is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular protein that binds DNA and transcription factors and regulates chromosomal structure and function. Under conditions of cell death or stress, it is actively or passively released by cells into the extracellular environment, where it functions as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that orchestrates pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inflammation. Our results demonstrate that HMGB1 is secreted in the tumor microenvironment after oncolytic HSV (oHSV) infection in vitro and in vivo. The impact of secreted HMGB1 on tumor growth and response to oncolytic viral therapy was evaluated by using HMGB1-blocking antibodies in vitro and in mice bearing intracranial tumors. IVIS and MRI imaging was utilized to visualize in real time virus spread, tumor growth, and changes in edema in mice. Our data showed that HMGB1 released in tumor microenvironment orchestrated increased vascular leakiness and edema. Further HMGB1 blocking antibodies rescued vascular leakiness and enhanced survival of intracranial glioma-bearing mice treated with oHSV. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) represents an attractive oncolytic virotherapy platform because of its potent tumor cell-killing and immune-stimulating properties; yet the clinical translation of VSV faces numerous challenges, such as inefficient systemic delivery and severe side effects such as neurotoxicity. We hypothesized that we could overcome these limitations and simultaneously enhance the therapy, by combining VSV with adoptively transferred T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells as carrier cells. We show that CD8 + T central memory cells (CD8 + T cm) can be efficiently loaded with VSV, they support intracellular virus production, and they can efficiently transfer VSV to tumor cells without compromising their own viability or antitumor reactivity. Loading VSV onto CD8 + T cm not only improves the safety compared with systemic administration of naked virus, but this approach also allows for an effective delivery of virus to its tumor target, resulting in an effective combination therapy in NSG mice bearing subcutaneous human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumors. We conclude that the combination of potent tumor debulking provided by the oncolytic VSV with the added effector functions afforded by the cytotoxic immune carrier cells results in a potent and safer immunotherapeutic, which can be further developed for clinical translation. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Recombinant measles viruses (MVs) have oncolytic activity against a variety of human cancers. However, their kinetics of spread within tumors has been unexplored. We established an intravital imaging system using the dorsal skin fold chamber, which allows for serial, non-invasive imaging of tumor cells and replication of a fusogenic and a hypofusogenic MV. Hypofusogenic virus-infected cells were detected at the earliest 3 days post-infection (dpi), with peak infection around 6 dpi. In contrast, the fusogenic virus replicated faster: infected cells were detectable 1 dpi and cells were killed quickly. Infection foci were significantly larger with the fusogenic virus. Both viruses formed syncytia. The spatial relationships between cells have a major influence on the outcome of therapy with oncolytic viruses. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Targeted molecular imaging allows specific visualization and monitoring of tumors. Cancer-specific peptides have been developed for imaging and therapy. Peptides that specifically target cancer have several advantages including, ease of synthesis, low antigenicity, and enhanced diffusion into tissues. We developed the HVGGSSV peptide as a molecular targeting/imaging agent. HVGGSSV targets Tax interacting protein 1 (TIP1) which is a 14 kDa PDZ domain-containing protein that is overexpressed in cancer. We docked HVGGSSV in silico using the three-dimensional structure of TIP1 and found the binding energy was −6.0 kCal/mol. The binding affinity of HVGGSSV to TIP1 protein was found to have a K D of 3.3 × 10 −6 M using surface plasmon resonance. We conjugated a 40 kDa PEG to HVGGSSV to enhance the circulation and evaluated the tumor binding in nude mice bearing heterotopic cervical (HT3), esophageal (OE33), pancreatic (BXPC3), lung (A549) and glioma (D54) tumors. NanoSPECT/CT imaging of the mice was performed 48 h and 72 h after injecting with 111 Indium ( 111 In) labeled PEG-HVGGSSV or PEG-control peptide. SPECT imaging revealed that 111 In-PEG-HVGGSSV specifically bound to cervical, esophageal, pancreatic, lung and brain tumors. Post SPECT biodistribution data further validated tumor-specific binding. Overall, HVGGSSV peptide specifically binds to the major groove of the TIP1 protein surface. PEGylated-HVGGSSV could be used to target cancers that overexpress TIP1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can support physicians in classifying different kinds of breast cancer, liver cancer and blood tumours also revealed by images acquired via Computer Tomography, Magnetic Resonance, and Blood Smear systems. In this regard, this survey focuses on papers dealing with the description of existing CAD frameworks for the classification of the three mentioned diseases, by detailing existing CAD workflows based on the same steps for supporting the diagnosis of these tumours. In detail, after an appropriate acquisition of the images, the fundamental steps carried out by a CAD framework can be identified as image segmentation, feature extraction and classification. In particular, in this work, specific CAD frameworks are considered, where the task of feature extraction is performed by using both traditional handcrafted strategies and Convolutional Neural Networks-based innovative methodologies, whereas the final supervised pattern classification is based on neural/non-neural machine learning methods. The cited methodology is focused on sharing and reviewing an amount of specific works. Then, the performance of three selected case studies are carefully reported, designed with the aim of showing how final outcomes can vary according to different choices in each step of the adopted workflow. More in detail, these case studies concern with breast images acquired by Tomosynthesis and Magnetic Resonance, hepatocellular carcinoma images acquired by Computed Tomography and enhanced by a triphasic protocol with a contrast medium, peripheral blood smear images for cellular blood tumours and are used to compare their performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "pH-responsive peptides are promising therapeutic molecules that can specifically target the plasma membrane in the acidified extracellular medium that bathes cells in tumors. We designed the acidity-triggered rational membrane (ATRAM) peptide to have a pH-responsive membrane interaction. At physiological pH, ATRAM binds to the membrane surface in a largely unstructured conformation, while in acidic conditions it inserts into lipid bilayers forming a transmembrane helix. However, the molecular mechanism ATRAM uses to target and insert into tumor cells remains poorly understood. Here, we determined that ATRAM inserts into cancer cells with a preferential membrane orientation, where the C-terminus of the peptide traverses the plasma membrane and explores the cytoplasm. Using biophysical techniques, we determined that the membrane interaction of ATRAM is contingent on the concentration of the peptide. Kinetic studies showed that membrane insertion occurs in at least three steps, where only the first step was affected by the membrane density of ATRAM. These observations, combined with membrane binding and leakage data, indicate that the interaction of ATRAM with lipid membranes is dependent on its oligomerization state. SPECT/CT imaging in mice revealed that ATRAM accumulates in the blood pool, where it has a prolonged circulation time (> 4 h). Since fast peptide clearance and degradation in circulation are major problems for clinical development, we studied the mechanism ATRAM uses to remain in the blood stream. Using binding and transfer assays, we determined that ATRAM binds reversibly to human serum albumin. We propose that ATRAM uses albumin as a carrier in the blood stream to evade clearance and proteolysis before interacting with the plasma membrane of cancer cells. We also show that ATRAM is able to be deliver liposomes to cells in a pH dependent way. Our data highlight the potential of ATRAM as a specific therapeutic agent for diseases that lead to acidic tissues, including cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The combination of imaging and anticancer therapy has recently emerged as a promising strategy. However, nonspecific imaging signals and distribution of anticancer drugs at normal tissues limit the specificity of the combination therapy. To overcome the challenges, we designed a system which can selectively visualize cancer tissues and initiate the subsequent action of therapeutic molecules in tumor microenvironment. Exploiting the overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in the tumor microenvironment, we designed a graphene oxide (GO)-based nanosheet system loaded with a pegylated MMP-cleavable imaging probe and an anticancer peptide shielded under the imaging probe. GO loaded with pegylated imaging probe derivative and anticancer buforin IIb peptide (IPGO/BF) was not fluorescent and BF hidden within pegylated surfaces did not exert anticancer activity. However, in tumor microenvironment, IPGO/BF selectively provided imaging by liberating pegylated fluorescent moiety. The cleavage of MMP-sensitive peptide triggered imaging signal and subsequent exposure of shielded BF on GO and enhanced its therapeutic function. SCC7 tumor-bearing mice treated with IPGO/BF exhibited selective fluorescence in tumor tissues, and greater imaging signal-dependent antitumor effects compared with other groups. The selective imaging-dependent sequential activation of anticancer therapy in tumor microenvironment would be a feasible strategy to reduce the nonspecific false-positive signals of tumor imaging and undesirable side effects of anticancer drugs at normal tissues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA) micelles affect drug solubilization, and a paclitaxel (PTX) loaded-PEG-b-PLA micelle (PTX-PM) is approved for cancer treatment due to injection safety and dose escalation (Genexol-PM®) compared to Taxol®. However, PTX-PM is unstable in blood, has rapid clearance, and causes dose-limiting toxicity. We have synthesized a prodrug for PTX (7-OH), using oligo(lactic acid) as a novel pro-moiety (o(LA) 8 -PTX) specifically for PEG-b-PLA micelles, gaining higher loading and slower release of o(LA) 8 -PTX over PTX. Notably, o(LA) 8 -PTX prodrug converts into PTX by a backbiting reaction in vitro, without requiring esterases. We hypothesize that o(LA) 8 -PTX-loaded PEG-b-PLA micelles (o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM) has a lower C max and higher plasma AUC than PTX-PM for improved therapeutic effectiveness. In Sprague-Dawley rats at 10 mg/kg, compared to o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM (10% w/w loading) and PTX-PM (10%), o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM (50% w/w loading) produces a 2- and 3-fold higher plasma AUC 0–24 of PTX, lactic acid-PTX, and o(LA) 2 -PTX (o(LA) 0-2 -PTX), respectively. For o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM at 10 and 50% w/w loading, PTX and lactic acid-PTX are major bioactive metabolites, respectively. Fast prodrug conversion of o(LA) 8 -PTX in vivo versus in vitro (by backbiting) suggests that o(LA) 8 is a good substrate for esterases. At 60 mg/kg (qwx3), o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM (50%) has higher antitumor activity than o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM (10%) and PTX-PM (10%) in a syngeneic 4T1-luc breast tumor model based on measurements of tumor volume, 4T1-luc breast tumor bioluminescence, and survival. Importantly, intravenous administration of o(LA) 8 -PTX-PM is well tolerated by BALB/c mice. In summary, oligo(lactic acid) 8 -PTX is more compatible than PTX with PEG-b-PLA micelles, more stable, and may expand the role of PEG-b-PLA micelles from “solubilizer” into “nanocarrier” for PTX as a next-generation taxane for cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Melphalan is an efficient chemotherapeutic agent that is currently used to treat retinoblastoma (Rb); however, the inherent risk of immunogenicity and the hazardous integration of this drug in healthy cells is inevitable. MicroRNAs are short non-coding single-stranded RNAs that affect a vast range of biological processes. Previously, we focused on the regulatory role of miR-181a during cancer development and progression. In this manuscript, 171 nm switchable lipid nanoparticles (LNP) co-delivered melphalan and miR-181a with encapsulation efficiencies of 93%. Encapsulation of melphalan in LNP significantly improved its therapeutic efficiency. Gene analysis shows that miR-181a decreases the expression of anti-proliferative gene MAPK1 and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, but significantly increased the expression of pro-apoptotic gene BAX. Our results suggest that the two agents have a complementary effect in reducing the viability of cultured Rb cells (primary and cell line) and decreasing Rb cell counts in an in-vivo xenograft Rb model in rats. Our results suggest that the proposed co-delivery technique significantly increases the therapeutic impact, allows for lower administration of melphalan, and consequently, could minimize the cytotoxic side-effects of this drug. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "We propose here a new approach to achieve intratumoral near-infrared (NIR) two-photon photodynamic therapy (PDT). We established a composite micellar thermosensitive hydrogel made of clinically approved methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-polylactide copolymer (mPEG-PDLLA) and Pluronic (F127). The mPEG-PDLLA form micelles that can be loaded with two-photon absorption compound (T1) and photosensitizer (PS), The F127 micelles are liquid at room temperature and while forming an hydrogel at body temperature. This enables an in situ gelification upon injection providing long-term retentio within the tumor. The NIR light is thus upconverted into visible light by T1 and excited PS. The morphology, rheology properties and releasing profiles of hydrogel were fully characterized. The rheology properties and releasing mechanism was investigated. The composite hydrogel showed significant cytotoxicity to 4 T1 murine breast cancer cells upon NIR laser irradiation, while it showed non-significant cytotoxicity without. Time-dependent in vivo and ex vivo distribution results suggested that hydrogel administrated via intra-tumoral injection could prolong both PDT agents retention in tumor. We show here that the use of NIR radiation allows deep tissue penetration and inhibition of tumor growth of >50% even under 1 cm thick muscle tissue. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "High metabolic activity, reflected in increased glucose uptake, is one of the hallmarks of many cancers including breast cancer. However, not all cancers avidly take up glucose, suggesting heterogeneity in their metabolic demand. Thus, we aim to generate a genomic signature of glucose hypermetabolism in breast cancer and examine its clinical relevance. To identify genes significantly associated with glucose uptake, gene expression data were analyzed together with the standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of 18 F-fluorodeoxy-glucose on positron emission tomography (PET) for 11 breast cancers. The resulting PET signature was evaluated for prognostic significance in four large independent patient cohorts (n = 5417). Potential upstream regulators accountable for the high glucose uptake were identified by gene network analysis. A PET signature of 242 genes was significantly correlated with SUVmax in breast cancer. In all four cohorts, high PET signature was significantly associated with poorer prognosis. The prognostic value of this PET signature was further supported by Cox regression analyses (hazard ratio 1.7, confidential interval 1.48–2.02; P &lt; 0.001). The PET signature was also strongly correlated with previously established prognostic genomic signatures such as PAM50, Oncotype DX, and NKI. Gene network analyses suggested that MYC and TBX2 were the most significant upstream transcription factors in the breast cancers with high glucose uptake. A PET signature reflecting high glucose uptake is a novel independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. MYC and TBX2 are potential regulators of glucose uptake. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Although our previous studies have showed that a novel oncogene, cancer upregulated gene (CUG)2 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the detailed molecular mechanism remains unknown. Because several lines of evidence documented that Yes-Associated Protein (YAP)1 is closely associated with cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotypes including EMT, stemness, and drug resistance, we wondered if YAP1 is involved in CUG2-induced EMT. We herein found that the overexpression of CUG2 increased YAP1 expression at the transcriptional as well as protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the elevated YAP1 transcripts are attributed to c-Jun and AP2 bindings to the YAP1 promoter. Akt and MAPK kinases including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK enhanced the level of YAP1 protein. In spite of a close relationship between β-catenin and YAP1, not β-catenin but NEK2 played the role in increasing YAP1 expression. Silencing YAP1 inhibited CUG2-induced cell migration and invasion. N-cadherin and vimentin expressions were decreased during YAP1 knockdown. The suppression of YAP1 diminished TGF-β transcriptional activity and expression as well as phosphorylation level of Smad2 and Twist protein. Conversely, LY2109761 or Smad2 siRNA treatment reduced YAP1 protein levels, indicating a close interplay between YAP1 and TGF-β signaling. Taken together, we suggest that CUG2 induces up-regulation of YAP1 expression, leading to enhancing CUG2-induced EMT via a close crosstalk between YAP1 and TGF-β signaling. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The overexpression of endothelin (ET)-1 or ET receptors (ETRs) is related to initiation and progression of tumor. In cancer cells, ET-1 activates various signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C through ETRs, although the mechanisms by which ET-1 activates these signaling pathways remain uncertain. Here, we found that ETRs interacted with annexin A2, which is overexpressed in various cancers. Annexin A2 bound to ET type A receptor and ET type B receptor. Upon ET-1 stimulation, serine phosphorylation of annexin A2 increased, while there is no change in tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin A2. On the other hand, annexin A2 silencing suppressed activation of ERK upon ET-1 stimulation. These results suggest that interaction of ETRs and annexin A2 may play important roles in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase upon ET-1 stimulation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4), are essential regulators of uterine biology. The imbalance of these ovarian steroid hormones leads to uterine diseases such as endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and infertility. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG-6) is an adaptor protein. MIG-6 mediates P4 signaling and acts as a tumor suppressor during endometrial tumorigenesis in both humans and mice. In previous studies, we developed the conditional knockout of Mig-6 in all uterine compartments (Pgr cre/+ Mig-6 f/f ; Mig-6 KO ) and endometrial epithelial cell-specific Mig-6 knockout (Sprr2f cre/+ Mig-6 f/f ; Mig-6 Ep-KO ) mice. Both mouse models developed endometrial hyperplasia and E2-dependent endometrial cancer. P4 treatment significantly decreases aberrant epithelial proliferation and AKT signaling in Mig-6 Ep-KO mice but not in Mig-6 KO mice. In the present study, we identified a calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPla2) as one of the genes down-regulated by Mig-6 in the uterus. We performed immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis to investigate the regulation of cPLA2 by MIG-6 as well as determine the expression patterns of cPLA2 in the uterus. While the expression of cPLA2 was stronger at the uterine epithelial cells of Mig-6 KO and Mig-6 Ep-KO mice compared to control mice, P4 suppressed the expression of cPLA2 in Mig-6 Ep-KO mice but not in Mig-6 KO mice. To determine the ovarian steroid hormone regulation of cPLA2, we examined the expression of cPLA2 in ovariectomized control, Mig-6 KO , Mig-6 Ep-KO , and PRKO mice treated with P4 or E2. After P4 treatment, cPLA2 expression was remarkably reduced in Mig-6 Ep-KO mice but not in Mig-6 KO mice. However, the expression of cPLA2 was not changed in PRKO mice. Our results identified cPLA2 as a novel target of MIG-6 in the murine uterus and identified its important role during endometrial tumorigenesis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aristaless-like homeobox1 (ALX1), a member of the ALX family, is capable of mediating survival and development of mesenchyme-derived elements in vertebrates and its mutation will prevent the fusion of frontonasal and maxillary elements. Recently, ALX1 has been reported to be associated with cancer progression. However, the specific roles of ALX1 in melanoma remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and biological functions of ALX1 in melanoma. We found that ALX1 was highly expressed in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of ALX1 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells. Furthermore, we showed that ALX1 knockdown reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in melanoma cells, which might be attributed to inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Taken together, this study provided a new insight into the role of ALX1 as a therapeutic target for melanoma treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial cell (VEC) apoptosis takes part in the development of various cardiovascular diseases. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) regulates apoptosis through various apoptosis associated client proteins. In previous study, we identified a novel HSP90 inhibitor HCP1 induced apoptosis in A549 human lung cancer cells. Here, we found that low-concentration HCP1 (1 μM, 2 μM) suppressed VEC apoptosis caused by serum and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) deprivation. HCP1 directly bound to glucose-regulated protein 94 (Grp94), an isoform of HSP90 located in endoplasmic reticulum, and HCP1 selectively inhibited Grp94 activity via binding to site 3. Overexpression of Grp94 inhibited the anti-apoptotic effect of HCP1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Therefore, we provided HCP1 as a new VEC apoptosis inhibitor which might be a potential compound in the treatment of VEC apoptosis related vascular diseases. And we provided new pieces of evidence to understand the role of Grp94 in VEC apoptosis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The MYCN oncoprotein induces the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells through regulating gene transcription. The E2F transcription factor 5 (E2F5) plays an oncogenic role in several types of cancer, however, its role in neuroblastoma cells remains poorly characterized. We report here that MYCN positively regulates E2F5 expression in neuroblastoma cells. Analyses of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and reporter gene assay demonstrate that MYCN directly binds to a Myc E-Box DNA binding motif within the promoter of E2F5 gene, whereby inducing its transcription. In addition, E2F5 knockdown inhibits the proliferation of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, E2F5 knockdown inhibits cell cycle progression, which could be attributed to its regulation in the expression of related cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), including CDK2 and CDK6. These results suggest that MYCN-regulated E2F5 upregulation is an important mechanism through which MYCN induces the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells. In conclusion, this study identifies E2F5 as a pro-proliferative factor in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, and also implicates it as a potential target in neuroblastoma treatment. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Graphene quantum dots-based nanoparticles (GQD-NPs) with reduction-responsive properties were synthesized via conjugation with two precursors, doxorubicin-disulfide-GQD that endowed the drug loading capability and polyethylene glycol-disulfide-Herceptin that enhanced the half-life and conferred active targeting ability towards HER2-overexpressed cancer. Disulfide linkages between the compartments are cleaved at a physiologically relevant concentration of glutathione in cancer cells, resulting a controlled release of drugs. In vitro analysis confirmed successful internalization of GQD-NPs in the cytoplasm and enhanced cellular uptake of DOX in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The GQD-NPs show potential as a theranostic agent for HER2-overexpressed breast cancer cells. © 2018 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",

    "Abstract": "Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) originating from a primary tumour, lymph nodes and distant metastases hold great potential for liquid biopsies by providing a molecular fingerprint for disease dissemination and its temporal evolution through the course of disease management. CTC enumeration, classically defined on the basis of surface expression of Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) and absence of the pan-leukocyte marker CD45, has been shown to correlate with clinical outcome. However, existing approaches introduce bias into the subsets of captured CTCs, which may exclude biologically and clinically relevant subpopulations. Here we explore the overexpression of the membrane protein O-glycan sialyl-Tn (STn) antigen in advanced bladder and colorectal tumours, but not in blood cells, to propose a novel CTC isolation technology. Using a size-based microfluidic device, we show that the majority (&gt;90%) of CTCs isolated from the blood of patients with metastatic bladder and colorectal cancers express the STn antigen, supporting a link with metastasis. STn + CTC counts were significantly higher than EpCAM-based detection in colorectal cancer, providing a more efficient cell-surface biomarker for CTC isolation. Exploring this concept, we constructed a glycan affinity-based microfluidic device for selective isolation of STn + CTCs and propose an enzyme-based strategy for the recovery of viable cancer cells for downstream investigations. Finally, clinically relevant cancer biomarkers (transcripts and mutations) in bladder and colorectal tumours, were identified in cells isolated by microfluidics, confirming their malignant origin and highlighting the potential of this technology in the context of precision oncology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Advanced breast cancer frequently metastasizes to the bone, resulting in patient morbidity and mortality. The interaction of tumor cells with osteoclasts and osteoblasts seriously affects the occurrence and development of bone metastasis in breast cancer. The signaling crosstalk among the Jagged1/Notch, TGF-β and IL-6 signaling pathways plays a significant role in the context of bone metastasis. Aim of the study: Although Wenshen Zhuanggu (WSZG) formula efficiently decreased the risk of bone metastases in tumor-bearing mice, it remains unclear how WSZG formula regulates the interaction of cancer cells with osteoclasts and osteoblasts in bone metastasis of breast cancer. Materials and methods: In this study, we investigated the role of WSZG formula in the progress of bone metastasis in breast cancer and focused on the cell-cell interactions of tumor cells with osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR were utilized to evaluate the inhibitory activities of WSZG formula on Jagged1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Osteoblast co-culture and osteoclastogenesis co-culture were applied to analyze the effects of WSZG formula on the interaction of tumor cells with osteoclasts and osteoblasts. A breast cancer xenograft model was also used to test the inhibitory effects of WSZG formula on bone metastasis in breast cancer. Results: WSZG formula decreased Jagged1 expression in osteolytic lesions in the breast cancer xenograft model. Additionally, WSZG formula decreased Jagged1 expression in tumor cell culture alone or co-culture with pre-osteoclasts and osteoblasts. In addition, WSZG formula decreased Jagged1 expression in Jagged1-overexpressing tumor cells. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that WSZG formula mitigates breast cancer bone metastasis through the Jagged1/Notch signaling pathway mediated by TGF-β and IL-6. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, air concentrations of BaP in two different seasons (winter 2015 and summer 2016) and BaP levels in ground vegetation from Tarragona County were used as control simulations performed with the WRF-CHIMERE air quality modelling system, in order to reproduce the incidence of that hazardous chemical in air and soils. The CTM was validated for the present climatology, showing a good ability to represent air and soil concentrations of BaP over the target domain (petrochemical, chemical, urban and background sites), particularly in the winter. Then, the variation of the BaP concentrations in air and soils were simulated for the time series 1996–2015 and for the climate change scenario RCP8.5 (2031–2050). While an increase is projected for the levels in air, particularly in chemical and remote sites where the variation can go up to 10%, in terms of soil deposition the findings are the opposite, with an evident decrease in soil BaP concentrations, particularly for background sites. Finally, a potential health effect of BaP for the local population (lung cancer) was assessed. Although according to the projections the EU threshold for BaP atmospheric incidence (1 ng m−3) will not be reached by 2050, there will be an increase in the life-time risk of lung cancer, particularly in the most populated areas within the simulation domain. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: The development of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype is a main obstacle to the successful treatment of breast cancer. Saponins of several herbs are considered as promising candidates for drug resistance treatment. We extracted Paris saponin VII (PS VII) from Trillium tschonoskii Maxim. and investigated whether it could sensitize chemoresistant breast cancer cells MCF-7/ADR to the cytotoxic effects of adriamycin. Materials and methods: MCF-7/ADR cells were exposed to 0.5 μM PSVII plus different concentrations of adriamycin (0–100 μM). Then, MTT assay and adriamycin accumulation assay were used to assess cell proliferation and intracellular adriamycin retention. P glycoprotein levels and intracellular rhodamine 123 (Rh-123) accumulations were investigated to measure the expression and activity of P-glycoprotein. A xenograft model of nude mouse was utilized to observe the effect of PSVII in vivo. Results: Treatment with PSVII influenced cell viability of MCF-7/ADR cells, as well as sensitized MCF-7/ADR cells to the cytotoxic effects of adriamycin. Moreover, PSVII significantly downregulated MDR1 expression in MCF-7/ADR cells. Intravenous administration of PSVII significantly enhanced anticancer efficacy of adriamycin to MCF-7/ADR xenograft model in nude mice. Conclusion: These findings suggested a possible application of PSVII in combination with chemotherapy and/or as neo-adjuvant therapy in the treatment of MDR breast cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we developed novel thermal and redox-responsive micelles based on the Pluronic F127 tri-block copolymer and employed these for redox-responsive intratumor release of bufalin, an anti-cancer drug. Pluronic F127 was first functionalized with carboxylate groups, and then assembled into micelles. The HOOC-F127-COOH micelles are 20 ± 4 nm in size at 37 °C, but expand to 281 ± 5 nm when cooled to 4 °C. This allows for the free diffusion of bufalin into the micellar cores at low temperatures, while at 37 °C the micelles are much more compact and the drug molecules can be effectively held in their interiors. A high encapsulation efficiency and loading content were obtained via drug incorporation at 4 °C. The drug-loaded micelles were cross-linked with cystamine, which contains a disulfide bond responsive to the local cancer microenvironment. In vitro studies showed that drug release from the cross-linked micelles was low under normal physiological conditions, but markedly accelerated upon exposure to conditions representative of the intracellular tumor environment. Confocal microscopy revealed that the cross-linked micelles gave high levels of drug release inside the cells. In vivo studies in mice showed the drug-loaded cross-linked micelles have potent anti-tumor activity, leading to high levels of apoptosis of tumor cells and significant reductions in tumor volume. The drug-loaded cross-linked micelles did not significantly influence body weight, and there was no evidence for detrimental off-target effects. These results indicate that the Pluronic-based micelles developed in this work are promising drug delivery systems for the targeted treatment of cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: In traditional Chinese medicine, supplementing Qi and strengthening body resistance are an important principle of anticancer treatment. Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. (ginseng) and Astragalus membranaceus Bunge (astragalus) are the representative herbs for this therapeutic principle. Aim of the study: This study aims to explore the effect of the water extract of ginseng and astragalus (WEGA) on regulating macrophage polarization and mediating anticancer in the tumor microenvironment. Materials and methods: A549 cells were cultured in tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) supernatant with various concentrations of WEGA (0, 5, 10, 20 mg/mL). A549 cell proliferation was determined through methyl thiazole tetrazolium (MTT) assay and real-time cell analysis (RTCA), respectively. In vivo experiments were performed with a Lewis lung cancer (LLC) xenograft mouse model. Forty-eight mice were divided into six groups and treated with saline, WEGA, or cis-diamine dichloro platinum (DDP) with dosage of WEGA (0, 30, 60, 120 mg/kg body weight/day). The different groups were administered with drugs via oral or intraperitoneal injection once a day for 21 consecutive days. Tumor inhibition rate, spleen index, thymus index, cytokine, protein, and mRNA expression levels were detected in mice. Results: In a co-culture system, WEGA remarkably inhibited A549 cell proliferation, promoted the expression of M1 macrophage markers and inhibited M2 TAMs markers. Therefore, WEGA affected the biological behavior of cancer cells by regulating the expression of some markers relevant to macrophage polarization. In addition, the group of WEGA and DDP chemotherapy effectively inhibited the transplanted tumor growth in mice and improved weight loss and immunosuppressive with the cisplatin inducing. Conclusions: This study provides mechanistic insights into the anticancer effect of WEGA through the regulation of macrophage polarization and highlights that WEGA could be a novel option for integrative cancer therapies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid urbanization and modernization have increased exposures to phthalates from synthetic materials used indoors in China. However, exposure to phthalates from indoor environment and the associated health risks to the urban population have not been adequately characterized and documented. In this study, we summarized the recent measurements of five commonly-used phthalates in indoor environment in urban China and documented their distributions. Based on the activity patterns and exposure factors of Chinese population, Monte-Carlo simulation was used to derive their exposures. On average, the daily intake of all the targeted phthalates was 3.6 μg/kg/day for adults; and for children it ranged from 4.4 μg/kg/day to 8.1 μg/kg/day. For children, the total risk from exposures inside residences and offices was 32%–90% and 4%–19%, respectively. From commuting environments and other indoor environments, it was 5%–31%, and 3%–26%, respectively. For adults, the total risk from residences and offices was 26%–78% and 9%–35%. Additionally, from commuting environments and other indoor environments, it was 8%–35% and 5%–11%, respectively. The non-carcinogenic risk assessment was based on a cumulative Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI cum ), with means ranging from 0.18 to 0.41, which was mainly as a result of exposure to DiBP and DnBP. The means for lifetime cancer risk resulting from DEHP exposure ranged from 0.4 × 10 −6 to 2.0 × 10 −6 for urban population groups. For 80% of working adults and 40%–75%% of children, their cancer risks exceeded the EPA's benchmark (1.0 × 10 −6 ). The present study could provide important information for decision makers to reduce indoor phthalate exposures as well as the associated health risks for larger population groups in Chinese cities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we prepared self-assembled micelles with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) for paclitaxel (PTX) delivery. MPEG-PCL was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization in which the hydroxyl group was substituted for a carboxyl group by succinic anhydride. PTX was then coupled to carboxylated MPEG-PCL through esterification (MPEG-PCL-PTX). MPEG-PCL-PTX micelles were prepared by a solvent evaporation method. Conjugation of PTX to MPEG-PCL-PTX was confirmed by 1H NMR. MPEG-PCL-PTX micelles self-assembled into micellar nanoparticles at concentrations above 2.5 × 10−2 mg/mL, as evaluated by fluorescence spectrometry. DLS and TEM analyses revealed that the micelles were globular in shape with an average size of 111 nm. The drug release studies under three pH conditions demonstrated that PTX release from MPEG-PCL-PTX micelles was entirely dependent upon the hydrolysis of ester bond between PTX and MPEG-PCL copolymer, therefore, no severe initial burst release but pH sensitive profile was observed. In vitro tests with the 4T1 cell line showed that conjugation of PTX to MPEG-PCL led to improved cellular uptake and apoptosis compared to free PTX, supporting the feasibility of using the micelles as drug carriers for cancer therapy. © 2018 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the present article is the evaluation, by means of life cycle assessment, of a system which consists of vacuum-tube solar thermal collectors. The system is appropriate for building integration and it has been developed in France. The methods ReCiPe and USEtox have been adopted. Regarding life-cycle results, according to the scenario “without recycling” and for 30-year system lifespan, ReCiPe payback time was calculated to be 18.14 years based on France's electricity mix whereas by using Spain's electricity mix (hypothetical scenario) it was found to be 4.03 years. Recycling offers a ReCiPe-payback time reduction of 2.66 years based on France's electricity mix and 0.59 years based on Spain's electricity mix. All the studied cases show ReCiPe payback times much lower than an assumed system-lifespan of 30 years. On the basis of ReCiPe midpoint and by considering material manufacturing of the 16 collectors and the additional elements of the system (scenario “without recycling”), among glass-, aluminium-, copper- and steel-based components, the copper-based ones present the highest impact in 15 of the 18 impact categories. For instance, for Freshwater eutrophication, the copper-based elements have a score that is around 30 times higher comparing to that of the aluminium-based ones. The USEtox findings, for the material manufacturing of the 16 collectors and the supplementary elements of the system and for the scenario “without recycling” reveal that the material with the highest total score in terms of: i) human toxicity/cancer is copper (6.7E−09 CTUh), ii) human toxicity non-cancer is propylene glycol (4.0E−08 CTUh), iii) ecotoxicity is copper (2.06 CTUe). Recycling of the metals, according to USEtox, offers an impact reduction of 20–95%. A discussion about factors that influence the environmental profile of building-integrated solar systems is also provided. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Road dust (RD) and its adsorbed pollutants have been regarded as a leading source of diffuse stormwater pollution. Therefore, a source-oriented mitigation strategy of pollutants in RD is important for an integrated stormwater management. In this study, a total of 66 RD samples were collected from 22 asphalt roads with five traffic load categories under different antecedent dry-weather periods (ADPs) in the city of Dresden, Germany. The surface loads (0.1–30.91 μg m−2) and solid-phase concentrations (0.95–27.83 μg g−1) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in RD were determined. The results show that the Σ16PAHs contents decreased with increasing distance from the city center to the city border. One-way ANOVA indicated that surface load was significantly dominated by ADPs and solid-phase concentration was statistically traffic-load dependent. According to the positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model, gasoline- and diesel-powered engine emissions always accounted for the highest proportions of total PAH contents. However, with an increasing ADP, the PAHs contents attributed to the incineration and tire debris became evident. The source-specific risks posed by PAHs were further estimated by the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) analysis. Traffic contributed to the majority of the carcinogenic substances. Moreover, the hazard quotient (HQ) and mean hazard quotient (MHQ) for the ecological risk assessment suggest that PAHs in RD had a 21% probability of being toxic to benthic organisms and aquatic environments. Capsule: Σ16PAH content decreased with an increasing distance from the city center to border, and an increasing number of PAH sources was identified with an increasing residual time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most common malignancies. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), with abnormal expression and constitutive activation, has been reported to promote proliferation, metastasis, survival and angiogenesis of HCC cells. Rheum palmatum (RP), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, exhibited tumor-suppressing effects in multiple human cancers, but its potential functions in HCC remain unexplored. Aim of the study: This study aimed to examine the involvement of STAT3 signaling in the anti-HCC effects of RP extract. Materials and methods: SMMC-7721 and HepG2 HCC cell lines were treated with RP extract for 24 h, and then viability, migration, and invasion of HCC cells and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were analyzed using MTS, wound-healing, Transwell invasion and tube formation assays, respectively. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to examine the activation of key molecules in STAT3 signaling, including STAT3, JAK2, and Src. Additionally, we explored the in vivo antitumor effects of RP extract in a xenograft tumor nude mouse model of HCC. Results: The result showed that RP extract reduced viability, migration, and invasion of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells and angiogenesis of HUVECs. It suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3 and its upstream kinases including JAK2 and Src. In addition, RP extract treatment downregulated STAT3 target genes, including survivin, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, Cyclin D1, CDK4, c-Myc, and VEGF-C. Furthermore, RP extract suppressed the xenograft tumor growth and activation of STAT3 in xenograft tumor mice. Conclusion: Collectively, the results showed that RP extract prevented HCC progression by inhibiting STAT3, and might be useful for the treatment of HCC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Passing the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) is a challenging aspect in nanomedicine. Utilizing surfactant particles is reported to be a potent strategy for easier BBB penetration. On the other hand, loading different functional molecules on a single particle is therapeutically and economically beneficial. In this study, multifunctional amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles have been prepared on the basis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. This Janus platform is armed with folic acid targeting agent and Doxorubicin (DOX) drug that have been conjugated on different sides of the nanoparticles. DOX has been conjugated via imine bond that makes these particles pH sensitive. Chemo-physical characters, in-vitro drug release pattern and toxicity of nanoparticles on rat C6 glioma cell line were studied that confirmed the preparation and pH-dependent behavior of nanoparticles. Microscopy observations showed the Janus morphology of nanoparticles and their cell penetration behavior. Prepared Janus nanoparticle can be utilized as a multifunctional nanomedicine platform for brain cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Gemcitabine (Gem) as an anti-cancer agent has been limited by its short circulation time and rapid metabolism that reflects in low tumor uptake and low therapeutic efficiency. To improve its anti-tumor activity, a novel FAPα enzyme-activated prodrug of Z-GP-Gem modified at 4-amino group of Gem was developed, which could effectively release parent Gem based on the specific cleavage via FAPα enzyme-activation in tumor microenvironment. Compared to Gem, the Z-GP-Gem prodrug exhibited significantly enhanced inhibition of both tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in BALB/c mice bearing orthotopic breast 4T1 tumors. The Z-GP-Gem prodrug has a prolonged circulation time and a high tumor uptake based on the modification of Z-GP dipeptide at 4-amino group of Gem. These eventually caused a marked improvement in the systemic toxicity and the tumor growth inhibition in 4T1 cells. More interestingly, the unexpected depletion of tumor-associated fibroblast (TAF) was observed during the treatment of Z-GP-Gem prodrug in animal model. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that the FAPα-activated prodrug Z-GP-Gem would be a desirable approach for tumor therapy by intravenous administration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of organic chemicals that are widely distributed in the atmosphere and well known for their adverse health effects. This study aims to describe, for the first time, the levels, sources and associated health risks of particulate PAHs in an urban background atmosphere of Lisbon, the capital and largest city in Portugal. PM10 aerosol samples were collected from early January to the end of December 2012 with a high-volume sampler and were later analyzed for 10 PAHs by high-performance liquid chromatography. The annual average of the sum of the concentrations of PAHs (ΣPAHs) was 1.64 ± 1.85 ng/m3. The dominant PAHs were pyrene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, fluoranthene and benzo[g,h,i]perylene. Together these species accounted for approximately 70% of the ΣPAHs. A marked seasonal variation was observed for the investigated PAHs, with the highest values in winter and the lowest in spring and summer, reflecting the variation of emissions and meteorological conditions over time. The average concentration of benzo[a]pyrene was found to be 0.107 ± 0.152 ng/m3, not exceeding the target value of 1 ng/m3 established by European air quality legislation. Diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis were employed for the source apportionment of PAHs. Both tools indicated that vehicle exhaust was the main contributor to the atmospheric levels of PAHs in the study area. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dryopteris crassirhizoma (DC) is used as a traditional herbal remedy to treat various diseases, the tapeworm infection, common cold, and cancer in Korea, Japan, and China. DC also has the antioxidant anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. However, the anti-allergic inflammatory effect of DC and some of its mechanisms in allergic rhinitis model are unknown well. Aim of this study: The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-allergic inflammatory effect of DC on the allergic rhinitis model, mast cell activation and histamine release. Materials and methods: Allergic rhinitis was induced in BALB/c mice by sensitization and challenge with ovalbumin (OVA). Different concentration of DC and dexamethasone was administrated by oral gavage on 1 h before the OVA challenge. Mice of the control group were treated with saline only. Then mice were evaluated for the presence of nasal mucosa inflammation, the production of allergen-specific cytokine response and the histology of nasal mucosa. Results: DC significantly ameliorated the nasal symptoms and the inflammation of nasal mucosa. DC also reduced the infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells in these tissues and the release of histamine in blood. Meanwhile, DC evidently inhibited the overproduction of Th2 cytokines and increased the Th1 and Treg cytokines in nasal lavage fluid by OVA. DC also reduced the levels of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a in blood. Conclusions: This study suggests that DC has a significant anti-allergic inflammatory effect in the nasal cavity. DC may have the therapeutic effect of allergic rhinitis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Oils and extracts of Eugenia uniflora have been reported as antimicrobial, antifungal, antinociceptive, antiprotozoal, antioxidant and cytotoxic. Aim of the study: The oils of five specimens (E1 to E5) that occur in the Brazilian Amazon were extracted, analyzed for their chemical composition, and submitted to antioxidant and cytotoxic assays. Material and methods: Oils were hydrodistilled, analyzed by GC and GC-MS, and submitted to PCA and HCA analyses. The antioxidant activity of the oils was evaluated by the DPPH radical scavenging and the β-carotene/linoleic acid assays. Antiproliferative effects of the oils and curzerene were tested against colon (HCT-116), gastric (AGP-01), and melanoma (SKMEL-19) human cancer cell lines and a normal human fibroblast cell line (MRC-5), using MTT assay. Results: Oxygenated sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons such as curzerene, selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-2-one, selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-2-one epoxide, germacrene B, caryophyllene oxide, and (E)-caryophyllene were predominant in the oils. PCA and HCA analyses classified the oils samples into four chemotypes. TEAC values of chemotype II (E3 oil, 228.3 ± 19.2 mg TE/mL) and chemotype III (E4 oil, 217.0 ± 23.3 mg TE/mL) displayed significant antioxidant activities. The oils E2 and E4 showed cytotoxic activity against all cell lines tested HCT-116 (IC50 E2:16.26 μg/mL; IC50 E4:9.28 μg/mL), AGP-01, (IC50 E2:12.60 μg/mL; IC50 E4:8.73 μg/mL), SKMEL-19 (IC50 E2:12.20 μg/mL; IC50 E4:15.42 μg/mL), and MRC-5 (IC50 E2:10.27 μg/mL; IC50 E4:14.95 μg/mL). Curzerene showed the more significant activity against melanoma cells (SKMEL-19, IC50:5.17 μM), induced apoptosis at 5.0 μM and 10.0 μM compared to DMSO, exhibiting a decrease in the cell migration at 5.0 μM and 10.0 μM, after 30 h of treatment. Conclusion: The curzerene chemotype oil and E. uniflora oils can be indicated as drug candidates for anticancer activity of the lung, colon, stomach, and melanoma, with a real prospect to their subsequent phytotherapeutic development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Plants of Epilobium angustifolium are popular in China to treatment of traumatic injury, subduing inflammation and menstrual disorders. In European, the preparations or extracts containing E. angustifolium are popular to treat prostate diseases. Recent research suggested that E. angustifolium showed therapeutic effects in early stage of BPH, inflammation of urethra and prostate, as well as micturition problems. And the related researches were focus on aqueous extract and its main constituent of oenothein B. Aim of the study: This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect against BPH of the ethyl acetate extracts (EAE) and n-butanol extracts (BUE) from E. angustifolium and to chemical investigation of the active constituents. Materials and methods: The in vitro anti-BPH activity was assessed by determining the benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial-1 (BPH-1) cell viability using MTT assay as well as suppressing of prostate specific antigen (PSA) secretion in prostate epithelial cancer hormone-dependent (LNCaP) cells measured by ELISA method. The in vivo anti-BPH was evaluated by testosterone propionate induced BPH SD rats. After oral administration of BUE at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg B.W. for 28 days, the prostate weight and index, plasma androgen level, histopathological alteration, oxidative and inflammatory-related factors in prostate were assessed. Phytochemical investigation on active extracts was carried by chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. Anti-BPH activities of the isolates were evaluated in vitro. Results: BUE and EAE from E. angustifolium exhibited significant anti-BPH effect in vitro. Further in vivo study demonstrated that BUE exhibited therapeutic effects against TP-induced BPH in SD rats via down-regulating of the androgen level, suppressing the expression of NF-κB and eventually alleviating the inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Phytochemical research on BUE and EAE extracts led to the isolation and identification of 50 compounds. In vitro anti-BPH screening revealed that 26 compounds exhibited anti-proliferation in BHP-1 cell and 36 compounds showed PSA inhibition in LNCap cell, in which 7 compounds exhibited very significant anti-BPH activities in both two cell lines (P < 0.01), 5 compounds with extremely significant activities in one of the cell lines (P < 0.001), and compound 25 exhibited the most potent anti-BPH activity (P < 0.001).

    "Abstract": "Two copper(II) complexes, [CuCl 2 (SarMeam) 2 ] · H 2 O (1) and [Cu(NO 3 ) 2 (SarMeam) 2 ] (2) were obtained by reactions of N′-methylsarcosinamide (SarMeam) with copper(II) chloride and copper(II) nitrate in aqueous solutions. The complexes were characterized by X-ray crystallography, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and DFT calculations. The octahedral coordination environments around the copper(II) ions in complexes 1 and 2 consisted of two N,O-bidentate N′-methylsarcosinamide ligands and two chloride or nitrate ions, respectively, forming trans isomers. The [CuCl(H 2 O)(SarMeam) 2 ] + and [Cu(H 2 O) 2 (SarMeam) 2 ] 2+ species formed upon dissolution of 1 by successive substitution of coordinated chloride ions with water molecules, while dissolution of 2 led exclusively to the formation of [Cu(H 2 O) 2 (SarMeam) 2 ] 2+ . [Cu(OH)(H 2 O)(SarMeam) 2 ] + species formed in basic solutions by deprotonation of coordinated ligands and then transformed to a planar [Cu(SarMeam −H ) 2 ]. Complexes 1 and 2 decomposed in highly acidic or basic solutions, giving [Cu(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ or Cu(OH) 2 , respectively. The water-soluble complexes 1 and 2 were biologically evaluated and tested on human bladder cancer T24 and UM-UC-3 cell lines and a panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. They showed excellent potency towards human bladder cancer T24 cell line and no activity against bacterial strains. At the same time no toxicity was noticed on normal human cells, as observed by the cell viability and comet assay on peripheral blood leukocytes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Several differently substituted Zn(II) phthalocyanines (ZnPcs) were prepared and conjugated to GQDs. The photophysical properties were determined for both the Pcs and their respective conjugates including the fluorescence/triplet quantum yields and lifetimes as well as the singlet oxygen generating abilities. Upon conjugation to GQDs, the fluorescence of the Pcs decreased (insignificant decrease in some cases), with an increase in the triplet quantum yields. However, the singlet quantum yields of the Pcs in the conjugates did not show an increase with the increase in the triplet quantum yields, this is suspected to be due to the screening effect. The cytotoxicity of the complexes in vitro decreased upon conjugation, as a result of the reduced actual number of Pcs units provided in the conjugate for therapy. Upon introduction of cationic charges, the photodynamic therapy activity of the complexes increased. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Five new copper(II) niflumate complexes, [Cu(en) 2 (nif) 2 ], 1, [Cu(unsym-dmen)(nif) 2 ], 2, [Cu(pn) 2 (nif) 2 ][Cu(pn) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ](nif) 2 3, [Cu(β-pic) 2 (nif) 2 ], 4, [Cu(γ-pic) 2 (nif) 2 ] 5 (where en = ethylenediamine, pn = propan-1,3-diamine, unsym-dmen = 1,1-dimethyl-ethylenediamine, β-pic = 3-methylpyridine, γ-pic = 4-methylpyridine, nif = niflumate) have been synthesized by using appropriate starting materials and methanol-water (4:1 v/v) as solvent. All the above synthesized complexes 1–5 have been characterized by spectroscopic methods (UV–Vis, FT-IR, and EPR). The structures of complexes 1, 3 and 5 have been unambiguously determined by single crystal X-ray structure determination which clearly revealed that these complexes are mononuclear complexes. The structure of complex 4 has been optimized by DFT calculations. In all complexes 1–5, niflumate ligand shows direct coordination to central copper(II) ion leading to covalent character of these complexes, although the complex 3 also contains cationic moiety [Cu(pn) 2 (nif) 2 ] 2+ and two nifumate ions. The ability of all the complexes to show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines has also been evaluated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Then synthesis of Ni (L) (1) and VO (L) (2) [H2L = N-2-hydroxyacetophenon-Ń-2, 4-dihydroxbenzaldehyde-1, 2-phenylenediimine)] novel unsymmetrical heterocyclic Schiff base complexes is reported. Elemental analysis, UV-Vis, IR spectroscopy, multi-nuclear spectroscopy (1H and 13C NMR) and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis have been used to characterize the products. UV-Vis spectroscopy, emission titration, viscosity measurement, helix melting methods and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy have been applied to investigate the interactions of the complexes with CT-DNA. Intercalative binding mode between the complexes and DNA is suggested by the binding constant (Kb) values of 2.9 × 104 and 5.4 × 104 for complexes 1 and 2, respectively. In particular, the in vitro cytotoxicity of the complexes on two cancer cells lines (MDA-MB 231, SKOV-3 cell line) showed that the compounds had broad spectrum, anti-cancer activity with low IC50 values and the order of in vitro anticancer activities is consistent with the DNA-binding affinities. In addition, protein binding studies using fluorescence spectroscopy have shown that the new complexes strongly quench the intrinsic BSA fluorescence by a static mechanism based on the bovine serum albumin (BSA) binding activity studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This study describes a simple, two-step method for obtaining ruthenium(II) trithiacyclononane ([9]aneS 3 ) flavonate complexes in yields ranging from 23% to 34%. With 7,3′,4′-trihydroxyflavone (thflv), a neutral complex, [Ru(II)([9]aneS 3 )(DMSO)(thflv)] (1), is formed by coordination at the catechol group. With chrysin (chrys) and tectochrysin (tchrys), Ru(II) binds to the chromenone fragment to form cationic complexes that are isolated as [Ru(II)([9]aneS 3 )(chrys)(DMSO)]Cl (2) and [Ru(II)([9]aneS 3 )(DMSO)(tchrys)]Cl (3). The structure of the complexes is characterised by FT-IR, NMR and ESI + -MS. Furthermore, the flavones and the corresponding complexes, 1–3, were investigated regarding their in vitro cytotoxic activity towards four different human tumour cell lines, PC-3 (prostate), MG-63 (osteosarcoma), MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (both breast adenocarcinoma). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A novel mechanism-based model - the Cancitis model - describing the interaction of blood cancer and the inflammatory system is proposed, analyzed and validated. The immune response is divided into two components, one where the elimination rate of malignant stem cells is independent of the level of the blood cancer and one where the elimination rate depends on the level of the blood cancer. A dimensional analysis shows that the full 6-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations may be reduced to a 2-dimensional system - the reduced Cancitis model - using Fenichel theory. The original 18 parameters appear in the reduced model in 8 groups of parameters. The reduced model is analyzed. Especially the steady states and their dependence on the exogenous inflammatory stimuli are analyzed. A semi-analytic investigation reveals the stability properties of the steady states. Finally, positivity of the system and the existence of an attracting trapping region in the positive octahedron guaranteeing global existence and uniqueness of solutions are proved. The possible topologies of the dynamical system are completely determined as having a Janus structure, where two qualitatively different topologies appear for different sets of parameters. To classify this Janus structure we propose a novel concept in blood cancer - a reproduction ratio R. It determines the topological structure depending on whether it is larger or smaller than a threshold value. Furthermore, it follows that inflammation, affected by the exogenous inflammatory stimulation, may determine the onset and development of blood cancers. The body may manage initial blood cancer as long as the self-renewal rate is not too high, but fails to manage it if an inflammation appears. Thus, inflammation may trigger and drive blood cancers. Finally, the mathematical analysis suggests novel treatment strategies and it is used to discuss the in silico effect of existing treatment, e.g. interferon-α or T-cell therapy, and the impact of malignant cells becoming resistant. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Diclofenac is a potent NSAID of clinical choice, which is widely used for containing inflammation. Moreover, recent experimental evidences overwhelmingly substantiate its antineoplastic potential. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of diclofenac's anticancer activity remain poorly understood. Neoplastic cells display reprogrammed metabolic features, which are manifested and regulated by a complex networking of molecular pathways. However, the effect of diclofenac on tumor cell metabolism are not yet clearly deciphered. Hence, the present investigation was carried out to identify and characterize key diclofenac targets of tumor metabolism, cell survival and chemoresistance. The interactions of diclofenac with such targets was analysed by PatchDock and YASARA (Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application). The docking ability of diclofenac with its targets was based on analysis of dissociation constant (Kd), geometric shape complementarity score (GSC score), approximate interface area (AI area) and binding energy. The findings of this investigation reveal that diclofenac is capable of interacting with all of the selected molecular targets. Prominent interactions were observed with GLUT1, MCT4, LDH A, COX1, COX2, BCRP/ABCG2, HDM2/MDM2 and MRP1 compared to other targets. Interactions were of noncovalent nature involving ionic, hydrophobic interactions, Van der Waals forces and H-bonds, which varied depending on targets. This study for the first time, characterizes the nature of molecular interactions of diclofenac with selected targets involved in cancer cell metabolism, pH homeostasis, chemosensitivity, cell signalling and inflammation. Hence, these findings will be highly beneficial in optimizing the utility of diclofenac in development of novel cancer therapeutics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "During the past decade, accumulating studies have been conducted on the mesoporous silica materials as the matrix of controlled drug-delivery, in which the complicated post-synthesis procedures are often involved with the molecular design to achieve the efficacy. In this study, a simplified drug delivery system of anti-cancer drug of doxorubicin (DOX) based on mesoporous SBA-15 functionalized with ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FCA) was constructed. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, the presence of FCA that was anchored inside the pore wall of amine groups grafted SBA-15 exhibits electron-accessible behavior without affecting the intactness of composite material. The pH-responsive release of drug molecules was achieved through the conjugation of DOX with FCA in the interior channels of mesoporous composites, which also favors the more coverage of DOX. Furthermore, the real-time cell analysis was performed to monitor the release of DOX from the mesopores and resulting cytotoxicity of cancer cell of A549 was evaluated, which results in a calculated IC50 of 43.8 μg/ml (24 h). The constructed mesoporous FCA-SBA-15 composite material provides an integrated nanoplatform to exert controlled-delivery of anti-cancer drug molecules. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A phenanthroline (phen) tethered berberine dimer 1 is synthesized and further conjugated with carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled single-stranded probe DNA (P-DNA) to give P-DNA@1. The mutual interaction of these two components triggers the fluorescence quenching of FAM, and the non-emissive P-DNA@1, in turn, functions as a sensor to detect cancer-associated microRNA-185 (miRNA-185), characterized by the FAM fluorescence recovery. The results show that P-DNA@1 is capable of detecting miRNA-185 in 2 min with the detection limit of 0.2 nM. The detection mechanism was supported by fluorescence anisotropy, binding constant and molecular docking study. Competing experiments further indicate that P-DNA@1 exhibits a high selectivity for miRNA-185 thus has a good potential in the diagnosis of related cancer at the early stage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The CYCIAE-230 cyclotron is a proton beam accelerator dedicated to cancer therapy. The low-level radiofrequency (LLRF) system of CYCIAE-230 cyclotron is designed based on the previous LLRF systems which have been successfully commissioned for CYCIAE-100 and CYCIAE-14 cyclotrons. This design includes four feedback control loops, namely, tuning loop, amplitude loop, phase loop, and balance loop. The LLRF system for CYCIAE-230 cyclotron have the same amplitude, phase, and tuning loops as the previous designs. Meanwhile, the balance loop makes the LLRF system stand out. It is enabled after the amplitude loop is closed and controls the homogeneity of the accelerating fields of the four cavities. From the bird view of the control system of the cyclotron, the LLRF system is an embedded control unit which communicates with the program logical controller with Profibus-DP (Distributed Peripherals). In this paper, the desktop experiment has been performed with a small-scale copper cavity with low power. This small-scale cavity has an unloaded quality factor (Q 0 ) of around 7800 and has push–pull and push–push resonate modes, which are the characteristic parameters of the cavities of CYCIAE-230 cyclotron. The design and performance of the LLRF system were discussed based on the desktop experiment results in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Mutation of p53 tumor suppressor gene represents one of the early molecular events in tumor initiation and progression. Although molecular computing holds tremendous potential with important applications in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of human diseases at the molecular level, designing molecular logic gates to implement cascade amplification via operating autonomously for the detection of point mutations still remains challenging. In this contribution, we developed a three concatenated logic gates (TCLG) to perform multiple strand displacement amplification (m-SDA) for screening the cancer-related point mutations only via designing an innovative molecular beacon (MB). Specifically, using p53 gene as model target, extending the two ends of a MB via adding two fragments with the same sequence achieves two unique terminal single-stranded (ss) overhangs. After self-folding of MB into hairpin structure, the two overhangs exhibit a near inverted mirror image (IM) relationship if taking the base nature and direction into account. For this, the probe is called IM-MB. Because cascade SDAs can occur on IM-MB and promote each other, the target gene can be detected down to 10 pM. Along this line, the TCLG circuit was proposed, and two primers and target gene serve as the indispensable input signals. Utilizing this logic circuit, the point mutation or absence of target gene can be sensitively screened. Moreover, its potential application in the recognition of point mutations in complex biomatrix has been demonstrated via blind test. The proof-of-concept scheme is expected to provide new insight into the development of DNA-based molecular logic gates and their applications in basic research, medical diagnosis and precise treatment and treatment of genetic diseases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin has been shown to promote progression in various cancers, including ovarian cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in Wnt/β-catenin activation are not well elucidated. In the work, we identify that R-spondin 1 is an upstream regulator in Wnt/β-catenin pathway to promote growth, survival and migration in ovarian cancer cells. We observe the upregulation of transcript and protein levels of R-spondin 1 in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues compared to normal counterparts. R-spondin 1 upregulation via genetic (overexpression) and pharmacological (recombinant protein) approaches facilitates growth and migration of normal ovarian cells. R-spondin 1 downregulation via siRNA knockdown decreases proliferation and migration, and induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. In addition, recombinant R-spondin 1 protects ovarian cancer cell against chemotherapy whereas R-spondin 1 knockdown sensitizes ovarian cancer cell response to chemotherapy. Importantly, increased β-catenin activities and mRNA expression levels of Wnt/β-catenin-targeted genes are detected in normal ovarian cells overexpressing R-spondin 1. In contrast, R-spondin 1 inhibition suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling in ovarian cancer cells. We further identify that R-spondin 1 regulates ovarian cancer biological activities via activating Wnt/β-catenin. Our work is the first to highlight the critical roles of R-spondin 1 in ovarian cancer progression and chemoresistance.

    "Abstract": "Background: Many enzymes involved in one‑carbon metabolism (OCM) are considered to have important roles in carcinogenesis, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the influence of polymorphisms in OCM genes on recurrence in HCC patients with liver transplantation has yet not been reported. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of donor liver graft OCM gene polymorphism on the prognosis of liver transplant recipients with HCC. Methods: This study enrolled 100 liver transplantation patients from a Chinese Han population to detect the association between donor OCM genes polymorphisms and post-transplant HCC recurrence. Nine SNPs from seven OCM genes (MTHFD1, MTR, MTRR, DHFR, ALDH1L1, SHMT1, and CBS) were evaluated by Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Result: None of the nine SNPs were significantly associated with cancer recurrence after liver transplantation. However, tumor-free survival for recipients with the AA genotype of rs1801394 polymorphism was significantly shorter than patients with AG/GG genotype (1097 ± 155 vs. 1657 ± 173 days, P < 0.05) among patients with alpha-fetoprotein < 400 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that recipients with donor rs1127717 homozygous TT had a significantly longer tumor-free survival and overall survival than heterozygous CT/CC recipients (tumor-free survival 1395 ± 128 vs. 671 ± 233 days, P < 0.05; overall survival 1540 ± 114 vs. 925 ± 242 days, P < 0.05) in the patient subgroup with well or moderately differentiated HCC. Conclusion: This is the first genetic study to examine the relation between donor liver graft OCM gene polymorphisms and the risk of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. Our findings support the hypothesis that polymorphisms of donor genes related to OCM play important roles in post-transplant HCC recurrence. Furthermore, donor rs1801394 and rs1127717 polymorphism may serve as promising prognostic biomarkers for HCC recurrence in liver transplant recipients. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "IIIM-290, an orally bioavailable preclinical candidate is effective in human xenograft models of leukemia, colon and pancreatic cancer. The promising preclinical data of this lead candidate has shown its potential for clinical development. As a part of its preclinical development, impurity profiling of pilot scale batches is one of the most important component of the CMC documentation. Herein, we report impurity profiling, its quantification in different scale-up batches and analytical method validation. Three impurities ranging from 0.09 to 1.25% in preclinical anticancer candidate, IIIM-290 were detected by validated HPLC method. The impurities (Imp-A, Imp-B and Imp-F) were isolated from the partially purified batch of IIIM-290 using semi-preparative HPLC. Isolated impurities were characterized by 1 H, 13 C NMR, FTIR and ESI–MS spectral data. Based on the characterization data, the sources of these impurities were identified as unreacted starting material (Imp-A), impurity from botanical raw material (Imp-B; impurity carried from starting material) and the chemically transformed product (Imp-F) of Imp-B, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Lifirafenib (BGB-283), a dual inhibitor trageting BRAF kinase and EGFR, showed favorable efficacy and safety in treating patients with different cancer types harboring mutations in BRAF, KRAS and NRAS. In order to support the clinical pharmacokinetic study, a sensitive high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) method was developed and validated to quantify lifirafenib concentration in human plasma and urine. Plasma samples were purified using protein precipitation. Urine samples were pre-treated by adding tween 80 with the purpose of preventing non-specific adsorption, then extracted by centrifugation. Chromatographic separation was achieved on Phenomenex Luna C 18 column with a gradient elution. The mass detection was performed using electrospray ionization (ESI) source under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive ionization mode. The method was fully validated, and the result of inter-assay and intra-assay precisions were less than 15% and the accuracy within the scope of ±15%. The linear range for plasma and urine covered from 10 to 10,000 ng/mL and 1 to 200 ng/mL, respectively, with correlation coefficients of 0.99. The validation for matrix effect, recovery, stability and carryover were met the acceptance criteria. The method showed robust and sensitive, it successfully fulfilled the requirement of clinical pharmacokinetic study of lifirafenib in Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the influence of halloysite nanotubes and magnetic nanoparticles stabilized by positively charged polyelectrolyte polyallyamine hydrochloride (PAH) on the built-up of multicellular spheroids using cancer and primary cell cultures. We found no adverse effects caused by the nanoparticles investigated on the formation of 3D cell structures. The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) has allowed controlling the spheroid spatial movement, which may find applications in cell biology, tissue engineering and nanomedicine. We have also shown for the first time that halloysite nanotubes do not affect the formation of spheroids, including those formed from mesenchymal stem cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "KDAC inhibitors (KDACi) overcome gefitinib primary resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including mutant-KRAS lung adenocarcinoma. To identify which proteins are involved in the restoration of this sensitivity and to provide new therapeutic targets for mutant-KRAS lung adenocarcinoma, we performed an iTRAQ quantitative proteomic analysis after subcellular fractionation of H358-NSCLC treated with gefitinib and KDACi (TSA/NAM) versus gefitinib alone. The 86 proteins found to have been significantly dysregulated between the two conditions, were mainly involved in cellular metabolism and cell transcription processes. As expected, the pathway related to histone modifications was affected by the KDACi. Pathways known for controlling tumor development and (chemo)-resistance (miRNA biogenesis/glutathione metabolism) were affected by the KDACi/gefitinib treatment. Moreover, 57 dysregulated proteins were upstream of apoptosis (such as eEF1A2 and STAT1) and hence provide potential therapeutic targets. The inhibition by siRNA of eEF1A2 expression resulted in a slight decrease in H358-NSCLC viability. In addition, eEF1A2 and STAT1 siRNA transfections suggested that both STAT1 and eEF1A2 prevent AKT phosphorylation known for enhancing gefitinib resistance in NSCLC. Therefore, altogether our data provide new insights into proteome regulations in the context of overcoming the NSCLC resistance to gefitinib through KDACi in H358 KRAS mutated and amphiregulin-overexpressing NSCLC cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ribociclib is a selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6, which has therapeutic potential for a variety of cancer types. This study was to develop and validate a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method for determining total and unbound concentrations of ribociclib in human plasma and brain tumor tissue samples. Plasma and tumor homogenate samples were extracted using protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Unbound fraction in plasma or tumor homogenate was determined by equilibrium dialysis method. Chromatographic separation was achieved based on aqueous normal-phase chromatography mechanism on a Waters XBridge ™ Amide column under isocratic elution with acetonitrile-ammonium formate (10 mM, pH 3) (75:25, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Ribociclib and the internal standard ([ 13 C 6 ]ribociclib) were monitored at the mass transitions m/z, 435.3 &gt; 367.2 and 441.3 &gt; 373.2, respectively, using positive electrospray ionization mode. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.5 nM of ribociclib in plasma. Linear calibration curve was established at the concentration range of 0.5–1000 nM in plasma. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were within the generally accepted criteria for bioanalytical method. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics and central nervous system penetration of ribociclib in patients with malignant primary brain cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Most cancer cells predominantly produce their energy through a high rate of glycolysis in the presence of abundant oxygen. Glycolysis has become a target of anticancer strategies. Previous researches showed that glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) inhibitor is effective as anticancer agents. This study assessed the effects of the selective GLUT1 inhibitor WZB117 on regulation of neuroblastoma (NB) cell line SH-SY5Y viability, cell cycle and glycolysis in vitro. SH-SY5Y cells were grown and treated with WZB117 for up to 72 h and then subjected to cell viability, qRT-PCR, Western blot and flow cytometry analysis. Level of ATP and LDH was also analyzed. The result showed that WZB117 treatment reduced tumor cells viability, downregulated level of GLUT1 protein. Moreover, WZB117 treatment arrested tumor cells at the G0–G1 phase of the cell cycle, induced tumor cells to undergo necrosis instead of apoptosis. In addition, WZB117 treatment downregulated the levels of intracellular ATP, LDH and glycolytic enzymes. Thus, WZB117-induced GLUT1 inhibition suppressed tumor cell growth, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced glycolysis metabolites in NB cells in vitro. This study suggested that GLUT1 can be used as a potential therapeutic target for NB. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Afatinib is an irreversible tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor which was approved lately by USFDA for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). AFT was subjected to stress degradation studies under hydrolytic (acid, base and neutral), oxidative, thermal and photolytic conditions to investigate the inherent stability of the drug. The present study describes the simple and rapid HPLC method development for the selective separation of the AFT and its degradation products. The drug and degradation products were separated on Agilent Eclipse plus C18 (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μ) column with ammonium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.7) in gradient elution mode. The drug was found to be unstable in all the conditions studied. The developed chromatographic method was extended to tandem mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) for the characterization of the degradation products. A total of 11 unknown degradation products were characterized using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS/MS). Two major degradation products (DP2 and DP3) were isolated using preparative HPLC and their structures were confirmed by conducting 1 H and 13 C NMR experiments. The isolated DPs were evaluated for their anticancer potential using non small cell lung cancer cell line A549. The IC 50 values for AFT, DP2 and DP3 were found to be 15.02 ± 1.49, 25.00 ± 1.26 and 32.56 ± 0.11 respectively. The in silico toxicity studies were performed employing ProTox-II software for the assessment of toxicity potential of drug and its degradation products. Finally, the developed chromatographic method was validated as per the International Conference on Harmonization guideline Q2 (R1). © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In China, urbanization strengthens the water-food-health nexus by driving dietary changes both at home and away from home (AFH). However, few studies have compared the effects of dining location on water footprint generation and/or linked such habits to the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer. Here, household survey data were used to develop a multiple-component urbanization sequence, on which the diet-related water footprint was quantified and the mechanisms under the water-food-health nexus were explored. Significant dietary changes due to urbanization have occurred at home (instead of AHF), and increases or decreases in various food groups are stratified across dining locations. Log mean Divisia index decomposition shows that the diet-structure effect outweighing the intake effect dominates the water footprint changes during China's urbanization. Animal products contribute 92(94)% of the diet-structure effect on net water footprint growth at home(AFH); in contrast, vegetal foods dominate the intake effect, contributing 67(49)%. The at-home water footprint ratio of animal products to vegetal foods is highly related to the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and asthma, and reaching statistical significance. Two urbanization components, namely housing situation and community diversity, serve as the key drivers of water-food-health nexus enhancement in urbanized China. Due to the complexity of water-food-health links, nexus thinking is needed to benefit human health and diet-related water consumption; besides, it may be reasonable to expand current dimension of food-energy-water nexus topic to include health issues. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Triptorelin is a synthetic decapeptide used for the treatment of prostate cancer. Attempts to determine triptorelin in clinical use by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring have encountered problems due to its low concentration in plasma (pg/mL) and interference from endogenous peptides. We have overcome these issues using micro-solid phase extraction (μ-SPE) on Oasis® HLB 96-well μElution plates followed by LC–MS 3 . Sample preparation by μ-SPE achieved sample concentration without the need for evaporation and reconstitution steps. Detection by LC–MS 3 showed no significant matrix interference at the retention time of analyte and achieved high sensitivity (lower limit of quantitation 10 pg/mL) and good linearity in the range 10–3000 pg/mL. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rat involving a single intramuscular injection of a formulation of triptorelin acetate biodegradable microspheres. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ilimaquinone, a metabolite isolated from the marine sponge Hippiospongia metachromia, has antimicrobial, cytotoxic, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. A new quantitative analytical method for determination of ilimaquinone in rat plasma using HPLC-MS/MS was developed and validated. Ascorbic acid was added to ensure the stability of ilimaquinone in plasma. After protein precipitation using acetonitrile plus diclofenac as an internal standard, the analytes were chromatographed on a biphenyl column with a mobile phase of methanol and water (8:2, v/v, including 0.1% formic acid).

    "Abstract": "Fluorescent conjugated polymers gained interest in the last decades for both imaging and targeting tumor cells for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In the light of this objective conjugated poly(p-phenylene) possessing β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) units in the main chain and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains is used as an imaging and therapeutic agent to target U87 and Vero cells. Additionally, imaging quality and therapy efficiency of the bare graft copolymer and its gold nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugated form were investigated and compared. It is observed that β-CD is effective not only for the imaging of the tumor cells, but also as a radiotherapy agent. Conjugation of the polymer with the AuNPs provides significant improvement in the therapeutic efficiency. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

    "Abstract": "A rapid, sensitive and wide coverage ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantitation of 14 alkylation DNA adducts in cell genomic DNA, RNA and cell contents isolated from the in vitro cultured human kidney cell line 293 T and the human liver cell line L02 exposed to 3 genotoxic reagents: N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). After exposure, DNA was isolated and directly hydrolysed under acid conditions or digested by enzymes to obtain the hydrolysates containing DNA alkylation adducts followed by optimization of the pretreatment method and chromatographic separation conditions. Quantification was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm) using an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive mode by selective reaction monitoring (SRM) at the precursor to product ion transitions of 14 analytes. The method showed selectivity, good linearity (r＞0.9950), accuracy (82.1%–115%), and intra-day (RSD%＜14%) and inter-day (RSD%＜15%) precision for 14 analytes. The recoveries of two pretreatment methods were all more than 50.5%, and no relative matrix effects were observed. Additionally, the samples were stable after short-term storage at 20 ℃ for 2 h, at 4 ℃ for 48 h or one cycle of freeze-thaw at −80 ℃. The established UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to evaluate the changes in alkylation DNA adducts and epigenetic modification-related methylcytosine after exposure to genotoxic reagents. For the first time, the results demonstrated that 3 genotoxic reagents induced different total amounts of adducts in the following sequence: MMS ＞ NNK ＞ MNU, and showed significant differences in the ratios of 7MeG to 1MeA and 1MeG to 1MeA in the 293 T cell model. Meanwhile, 293 T and L02 cells revealed significantly different DNA adduct formation characteristics in the contents of 1MeG and 1MeA. The DNA adduct formation relationships between DNA, RNA, and cell contents were probed to predict cancer risk and potential genotoxic exposure. This approach could be used to investigate the DNA adducts, their formation and the relationship to the mutagenicity or carcinogenicity of genotoxic reagents in future studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Aberrant expression of HOXA5 results in various diseases, including cancers. However, the specific function and molecular mechanism of HOXA5 in osteosarcoma is not fully understood. In the present study, we focused on HOXA5 in U2OS and MG63 cells in vitro. We observed lower expression of HOXA5 in U2OS, MG63, and SaOS2 human osteosarcoma cells, compared with hFOB1.19 human osteoblastic cells. HOXA5 overexpression in U2OS and MG63 cells markedly reduced cell survival and proliferation and elevated cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. HOXA5 also activated the p38α MAPK pathway by increasing p53. Treating U2OS and MG63 cells with the p53 inhibitor α-pifithrin or the p38α MAPK inhibitor SB203580 led to higher cell survival and proliferation and lower cell apoptosis, compared with the pcDNA3.1-HOXA5 group. In conclusion, our study showed that the p53 and p38α MAPK signal axis facilitated HOXA5's role in inhibiting growth and stimulating apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in the oral cavity and is often involved in periodontal diseases. Recent studies have shown increased F. nucleatum prevalence in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, and causal data has linked this bacterium to CRC tumorigenesis. Immune-based approaches to contain, reduce or eradicate its gut colonization may prevent CRC. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are naturally produced by Gram-negative bacteria, typically contain multiple putative virulence factors and may elicit protective immune responses if used as vaccines. Here, OMVs were isolated from F. nucleatum cultures and purified using gradient centrifugation. Proteins contained within the OMVs were identified by nano LC/MS/MS analysis. Of 98 proteins consistently identified from duplicate analyses, 60 were predicted to localize to the outer membrane or periplasm via signal peptide driven translocation. Of these, six autotransporter proteins, which constitute the majority of protein mass of OMVs, were associated with Type V secretion system. In addition, other putative virulence factor proteins with functional domains, including FadA, MORN2 and YadA-like domain, were identified with multiple exposed epitope sites as determined by in silico analysis. Altogether, the non-replicative OMVs of F. nucleatum contain multiple antigenic virulence factors that may play important roles in the design and development of vaccines against F. nucleatum. Significance: Fusobacterium nulceatum has been proved playing significant role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Outer membrane vesicles are nanoparticles that naturally secreted by Gram-negative bacterial containing various antigenic components, which provides new insight in vaccine development. Understanding the constituents of F. nucleatum OMVs will provide fundamental information and potential strategies for OMV-based F. nucleatum vaccines design. Based on our knowledge this is the first proteomic study of OMVs from F. nucleatum. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "In this study, different solvent extracts (methanol, dichloromethane and n-hexane) from aerial and stem parts of Buxus papillosa C.K. Schneid (Buxaceae) were investigated for a panoply of bioassays. Biological profiles were established by determining antioxidant and enzyme inhibition profiles. Toxicity was tested using MTT cell viability assay on five different human cancer cell lines i.e, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, CaSki, DU-145 and SW-480. For chemical fingerprinting, total bioactive contents and UHPLC-MS secondary metabolites profile were determined. Generally, both aerial and stem methanol extracts had highest total bioactive contents, radical scavenging and reducing power potential. DCM and n-hexane extracts were found to be most active for total antioxidant and metal chelating activity. The UHPLC-MS analysis of methanol extracts revealed the presence of several phenolic, flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin and depsipeptide derivatives. All the extracts were significantly active against butyrylcholinesterase, whereas moderate inhibition was observed for acetylcholinesterase, α-glucosidase and urease. Similarly, a considerable level of cytotoxicity was observed against all the tested cell lines with IC 50 values ranging from 26 to 225.9 μg/mL. Aerial methanol and stem n-hexane extracts were found to be most cytotoxic. Principal component analysis was also performed to find any possible correlation between biological activities and total bioactive contents. On the basis of our findings, B. papillosa may be considered as promising source of bioactive molecules. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Motesanib is a potent angiokinase inhibitor, has shown potential therapeutic effects against various cancers. An accurate, reproducible, rapid, specific, sensitive, and valid ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established to quantify motesanib in rat plasma. Motesanib and linifanib (used as an internal standard; IS) were extracted from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction using tert-butyl methyl ether as extracting agent. Chromatographic separation was performed on Acquity™ UPLC BEH™ C 18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 μm; Waters Corp., USA) using a mobile phase comprising of 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile: ammonium acetate (90:10 v/v) eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The electrospray ionization in the positive-mode was used for sample ionization. In the multiple reaction monitoring mode, motesanib and the IS were quantified using precursor-to-product ion transitions of m/z 374.03 → 212.02 and m/z 376.05 → 251.05, respectively. The ranges of the calibration curves were 5.0–1000.0 ng/mL with coefficient of determination of ≥0.998. The method was validated by following recently implemented USFDA guideline for bioanalytical method validation. The lower limit of quantification was 5.0 ng/mL, whereas the intra-day and inter-day accuracies of quality controls (QCs) samples were ranged between 88.91% to 95.65% and 90.20% to 102.17%, respectively. In addition, the linearity, recovery, precision, and stability parameters were found to be within the acceptable range. The method was applied successfully to in vitro microsomal metabolic stability and preliminary oral pharmacokinetic studies in rats. The applied UPLC/MS/MS method was found to be adequately sensitive and therefore suitable for application in routine motesanib pharmacokinetic studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Relative quantification of human alpha-acid glycoprotein (hAGP) glycan isomers using [ 12 C 6 ]/[ 13 C 6 ]-aniline in combination with multivariate data analysis is proposed as an efficient method for the identification of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) glycan biomarkers in serum samples. Intact and desialylated glycans from hAGP, purified from serum samples of patients with PDAC and chronic pancreatitis (ChrP), were labeled with aniline and analyzed by μZIC-HILIC-MS. Afterwards, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to the relative areas obtained for all glycan isomers in the different samples: pathological (ChrP or PDAC) versus healthy samples. Seven intact glycan isomers with α2-6 linked sialic acids, five of them also fucosylated, were the most meaningful to distinguish between PDAC and ChrP patients. The desialylated glycan isomers also identified by PLS-DA as potential biomarker candidates confirmed that antenna but also core fucosylation could be involved in PDAC. The analysis of intact and desialylated glycan isomers in combination with the multivariate data analysis revealed that the triantennary glycan with two fucoses of hAGP could have in the future a relevant role in the differentiation of patients with PDAC from those with ChrP. Significance: Multivariate data analysis is currently being used in many omics fields for biomarker discovery. However, to date, no glycomics studies have applied chemometric tools combined with mass spectrometry in a preclinical research. In this work, this methodology has been used to identify altered glycosylation of human alpha-acid glycoprotein in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The obtained results reveal that the triantennary glycan with two fucoses could have a great biomarker potential as it was relevant to differentiate PDAC and chronic pancreatitis (ChrP) patients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Hormesis is a dose-response relationship phenomenon characterized by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition. Although hormetic phenomena have been reported in broadly ranging biological areas, there is still no unified mechanism of hormesis. Investigating multiple-species hormesis of one compound and then exploring the possible mechanism may be an effective approach to clarify the reason for the occurrence of hormetic phenomena in a broad range of organisms. In this study, indole was selected as the test chemical due to the broad biological and hormetic effects of indole compounds. The results show that indole induces multiple-species hormetic phenomena in bacteria (Aliivibrio fischeri (A. fischeri), Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis), algae (Microcystis aeruginosa and Selenastrum capricornutum), and human cells (human skin fibroblasts and human cervical cancer cells). Through in-depth investigation of the time-dependent hormetic effects of indole, indole derivatives and indole's structural analogs on the bioluminescence of A. fischeri, indole ring has been identified as the potential key structure that causes indole to act on quorum sensing of A. fischeri to induce hormetic effects on the bioluminescence at lag, logarithmic, and stationary phases. Therefore, the occurrence of multiple-species hormetic phenomena is speculated to be derived from the action of indole on the cell-to-cell communication of organism cells. This paper can not only further confirm the generalizability of hormesis but also provide a reasonable explanation for hormesis, which will benefit the development of hormesis and the risk assessment of environmental pollutants. © 2018",
