    "Abstract": "RAS family GTPases contribute directly to the regulation of type I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) via RAS-binding domains in the PI3K catalytic p110 subunits. Disruption of this domain of p110α impairs RAS-mutant-oncogene-driven tumor formation and maintenance. Here, we test the effect of blocking the interaction of RAS with p110α on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant-driven lung tumorigenesis. Disrupting the RAS-PI3K interaction inhibits activation of both AKT and RAC1 in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells, leading to reduced growth and survival, and inhibits EGFR-mutant-induced tumor onset and promotes major regression of established tumors in an autochthonous mouse model of EGFR-mutant-induced lung adenocarcinoma. The RAS-PI3K interaction is thus an important signaling node and potential therapeutic target in EGFR-mutant lung cancer, even though RAS oncogenes are not themselves mutated in this setting, suggesting different strategies for tackling tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in lung cancer. © 2018 The Author(s)The interaction between RAS and PI 3-kinase is essential for RAS-mutant-induced carcinogenesis. Murillo et al. show that in EGFR-mutant-driven lung cancer, disruption of the interaction of PI 3-kinase with normal RAS proteins blocks tumor initiation and promotes regression of existing tumors, highlighting an unexpected vulnerability of EGFR-driven lung cancer. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Major cause of cervical cancer is a persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomaviruses (HPV). For that reason, HPV testing is now becoming an important addition to standard cytological screening of cervical malignancies in women (known as Pap test). New methods are sought which could offer rapid and inexpensive detection schemes, such as those based on electrochemical (EC) readout. Here, we developed an assay for parallel detection of two most oncogenic high-risk HPV types, HPV16 and HPV18, by combining loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) of template DNA, its separation using magnetic beads and detection with amperometry at carbon-based electrode chips. Our EC-LAMP test enabled us to successfully discriminate both HPV types not only in cancer cell lines, but also using clinical material obtained from HPV-positive patient samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Complement-mediated cytotoxicity may act as a selective pressure for tumor overexpression of complement regulators. We hypothesize that the same selective pressure could lead to complement alterations at the genetic level. We find that, when analyzed as a pathway, mutations in complement genes occur at a relatively high frequency and are associated with changes in overall survival across a number of cancer types. Analysis of pathways expressed in patients with complement mutations that are associated with poor overall survival reveals crosstalk between complement and hypoxia in colorectal cancer. The importance of this crosstalk is highlighted by two key findings: hypoxic signaling is increased in tumors harboring complement mutations, and hypoxic tumor cells are resistant to complement-mediated cytotoxicity due, in part, to hypoxia-induced expression of complement regulator CD55. The range of strategies employed by tumors to dysregulate the complement system testifies to the importance of this pathway in tumor progression. © 2018 The Author(s)Mutations in the complement system are prevalent across cancers. Olcina et al. find that colorectal cancers with complement component mutations are associated with increased hypoxic signaling and poor overall survival outcomes. Hypoxia-induced expression of complement regulator CD55 controls complement-mediated cytotoxicity. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Molecular subtyping of cancer offers tremendous promise for the optimization of a precision oncology approach to anticancer therapy. Recent advances in pancreatic cancer research uncovered various molecular subtypes with tumors expressing a squamous/basal-like gene expression signature displaying a worse prognosis. Through unbiased epigenome mapping, we identified deltaNp63 as a major driver of a gene signature in pancreatic cancer cell lines, which we report to faithfully represent the highly aggressive pancreatic squamous subtype observed in vivo, and display the specific epigenetic marking of genes associated with decreased survival. Importantly, depletion of deltaNp63 in these systems significantly decreased cell proliferation and gene expression patterns associated with a squamous subtype and transcriptionally mimicked a subtype switch. Using genomic localization data of deltaNp63 in pancreatic cancer cell lines coupled with epigenome mapping data from patient-derived xenografts, we uncovered that deltaNp63 mainly exerts its effects by activating subtype-specific super enhancers. Furthermore, we identified a group of 45 subtype-specific super enhancers that are associated with poorer prognosis and are highly dependent on deltaNp63. Genes associated with these enhancers included a network of transcription factors, including HIF1A, BHLHE40, and RXRA, which form a highly intertwined transcriptional regulatory network with deltaNp63 to further activate downstream genes associated with poor survival. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Glutathione is overexpressed in tumor cells and regulates cancer growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. Therefore, detecting glutathione levels may greatly facilitate cancer diagnosis and treatment response monitoring. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a noninvasive modality for high-sensitivity, high-resolution, deep-tissue optical imaging. Switchable PA probes that offer signal on/off responses to tumor targets would further improve the detection sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio of PA imaging. Here, we explore the use of MnO 2 nanotubes as a switchable and biodegradable PA probe for dynamic imaging of glutathione in cancer. Glutathione reduces black MnO 2 nanotubes into colorless Mn 2+ ions, leading to decreased and signal off PA amplitude. In phantoms, we observed a linear response of reduced PA signals of MnO 2 nanotubes to increased glutathione concentrations. Using melanoma as the disease model, we demonstrated that MnO 2 nanotube-based PA imaging of glutathione successfully distinguished B16F10 melanoma cells from BEAS-2B normal cells and discriminated B16F10 tumors from healthy skin tissues. Our results showed that MnO 2 nanotubes are a potent switchable and biodegradable PA probe for glutathione imaging in cancer diagnosis. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Bimetallic Au-Ag/Co3O4 nanofibers (Au-Ag/Co3O4NFs) were synthesized by an electrospinning method and calcination treatment. Due to the admirable synergic effect of electrocatalytic ability of Au and Ag, and the large surface-to-volume ratio of Co3O4 nanofibers caused by their rough surface, the synthesized Au-Ag/Co3O4NFs were applied to a sensing platform for hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Using electrochemical techniques, the novel sensing platform based on Au-Ag/Co3O4NFs shows a wide linear concentration range with high detection sensitivity of 1241.1 μA mM−1 cm−2. This sensitive sensor was also applied to determine H2O2 from human breast cancer cells, indicating its great potential application in physiology and pathology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "DNA nanotechnology has laid a platform to construct a variety of custom-shaped nanoscale objects for functionalization of specific target materials to achieve programmability and molecular recognition. Herein, we prepared DNA nanostructures [namely, synthetic DNA rings (RDNA) and DNA duplexes extracted from salmon (SDNA)] containing metal ions (M2+) such as Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ as payloads for delivery to exterminate highly pathologic hospital bacterial strains (e.g., Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) and prostate cancer cells (i.e., PC3, LNCaP, TRAMP-C1, 22Rv1, and DU145). Morphologies of these M2+-doped RDNA were visualized using atomic force microscopy. Interactions between M2+ and DNA were studied using UV-vis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Quantitative composition and chemical changes in DNA without or with M2+ were obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition, M2+-doped DNA complexes were subjected to antibacterial activity studies. They showed no bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on bacterial strains used. Finally, in vitro cellular toxicity study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pristine DNA and M2+-doped DNA complexes on prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxicities conferred by M2+-doped DNA complexes for most cell lines were significantly higher than those of M2+ without DNA. Cellular uptake of these complexes was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using PhenGreen FL indicator. On the basis of our observations, DNA nanostructures can be used as safe and efficient nanocarriers for delivery of therapeutics. They have enhanced therapeutic window than bare metals. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The emergence of circulating miRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer necessitates reliable approaches to detect miRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. We disclose a highly sensitive method for rapid and direct quantification of circulating miRNA in serum by combining dynamic DNA circuit and single-molecule fluorescence detection. The product of DNA circuits based amplification is detected by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The single-molecule counting allows the quantification of miRNA targets. Owing to the high sensitivity for fluorophore labeled nucleic acids of TIRFM, the products generated by 15 min amplification are sufficient for quantification. Meanwhile, the fast detection also addresses the problem of leakage because non-target triggered DNA circuits is relatively slow. There miRNA biomarkers miR-141, miR-21, miR-16 were detected with remarkable sensitivity as detection limits of 0.017, 0.012, 0.006 fM, respectively. This approach was applied for the direct quantification of the circulating miRNAs in human serum. The results of 29 health samples, 18 prostate cancer samples, 23 breast cancer samples imply that miR-141 and miR-21 are up-regulated in the prostate cancer samples and the breast cancer samples, respectively, and as reference miR-16 shows no difference in health and patient samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Mechanistic models are essential to deepen the understanding of complex diseases at the molecular level. Nowadays, high-throughput molecular and phenotypic characterizations are possible, but the integration of such data with prior knowledge on signaling pathways is limited by the availability of scalable computational methods. Here, we present a computational framework for the parameterization of large-scale mechanistic models and its application to the prediction of drug response of cancer cell lines from exome and transcriptome sequencing data. This framework is over 10 4 times faster than state-of-the-art methods, which enables modeling at previously infeasible scales. By applying the framework to a model describing major cancer-associated pathways (&gt;1,200 species and &gt;2,600 reactions), we could predict the effect of drug combinations from single drug data. This is the first integration of high-throughput datasets using large-scale mechanistic models. We anticipate this to be the starting point for development of more comprehensive models allowing a deeper mechanistic insight. © 2018 The AuthorsFröhlich et al. present a computational framework that allows training of mechanistic models at a previously infeasible scale. They apply the framework for drug response prediction in a cancer signaling context and demonstrate that combination treatment outcomes can be predicted from single drug treatment data. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: The p73 protein is a tumor suppressor that shares structural and functional similarity with p53. p73 is expressed in two major isoforms; the TA isoform that interacts with p53 pathway, thus acting as tumor suppressor and the N-terminal truncated ΔN isoform that inhibits TAp73 and p53 and thus, acts as an oncogene. Results: By employing a drug repurposing approach, we found that protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a metabolite of aminolevulinic acid applied in photodynamic therapy of cancer, stabilizes TAp73 and activates TAp73-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells lacking p53. The mechanism of TAp73 activation is via disruption of TAp73/MDM2 and TAp73/MDMX interactions and inhibition of TAp73 degradation by ubiquitin ligase Itch. Finally, PpIX showed potent antitumor effect and inhibited the growth of xenograft human tumors in mice. Conclusion: Our findings may in future contribute to the successful repurposing of PpIX into clinical practice. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Mastri et al. show that resistance to antiangiogenic therapy can induce senescence-mimicking secretory phenotypes that contribute to tumor promotion when treatment is stopped. Therapeutic targeting of senescence secretory regulators such as IL-6 and mTOR could improve outcomes after treatment failure. © 2018 The Author(s)VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR TKIs) approved to treat multiple cancer types can promote metastatic disease in certain limited preclinical settings. Here, we show that stopping VEGFR TKI treatment after resistance can lead to rebound tumor growth that is driven by cellular changes resembling senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) known to promote cancer progression. A SASP-mimicking antiangiogenic therapy-induced secretome (ATIS) was found to persist during short withdrawal periods, and blockade of known SASP regulators, including mTOR and IL-6, could blunt rebound effects. Critically, senescence hallmarks ultimately reversed after long drug withdrawal periods, suggesting that the transition to a permanent growth-arrested senescent state was incomplete and the hijacking of SASP machinery ultimately transient. These findings may account for the highly diverse and reversible cytokine changes observed in VEGF inhibitor-treated patients, and suggest senescence-targeted therapies (“senotherapeutics”)—particularly those that block SASP regulation—may improve outcomes in patients after VEGFR TKI failure. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Oncological diseases are the main causes of death in the world. Modern treatment of cancer patients contributes to an increase in survival rate due to strong chemotherapeutic drugs, the use of which is accompanied by toxic effects on cardiomyocytes. The main manifestations of cardiotoxicity are left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, thromboembolic complications, chronic heart failure. As a result, the risk of cardiovascular mortality may be higher than the risk of death from the tumor process. An important task of oncologists and cardiologists is the early diagnosis of cardiotoxic complications in order to start treatment in time and reduce mortality from cardiovascular pathology in cancer patients.",

    "Abstract": "The analysis of heterogeneous subpopulations of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is critical to enhance our understanding of cancer metastasis and enable noninvasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. The phenotypic variability and plasticity of these cells - properties closely linked to their clinical behavior - demand techniques that isolate viable, discrete fractions of tumor cells for functional assays of their behavior and detailed analysis of biochemical properties. Here, we introduce the Prism Chip, a high-resolution immunomagnetic profiling and separation chip which harnesses a cobalt-based alloy to separate a flowing stream of nanoparticle-bound tumor cells with differential magnetic loading into 10 discrete streams. Using this approach, we achieve exceptional purity (5.7 log white blood cell depletion) of isolated cells. We test the differential profiling function of the integrated device using prostate cancer blood samples from a mouse xenograft model. Using integrated graphene Hall sensors, we demonstrate concurrent automated profiling of single cells and CTC clusters that belong to distinct subpopulations based on protein surface expression. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Topical treatment using photodynamic therapy (PDT) for many types of skin cancers has largely been limited by the inability of existing photosensitizers to penetrate into the deep skin tissue. To overcome these problems, we developed a mesoporous nanovehicle with dual loading of photosensitizers and clinically relevant drugs for combination therapy, while utilizing microneedle technology to facilitate their penetration into deep skin tissue. Sub-50 nm photodynamically active mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles were synthesized with photosensitizers covalently bonded to the silica matrix, which dramatically increased the quantum yield and photostability of these photosensitizers. The mesopores of the nanoparticles were further loaded with small-molecule inhibitors, i.e., dabrafenib and trametinib, that target the hyperactive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway for melanoma treatment. As-prepared empty nanovehicle was cytocompatible with normal skin cells in the dark, while NIR-irradiated drug-loaded nanovehicle showed a synergistic killing effect on skin cancer cells mainly through reactive oxygen species and caspase-activated apoptosis. The nanovehicle could significantly inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in a 3D spheroid model in vitro. Porcine skin fluorescence imaging demonstrated that microneedles could facilitate the penetration of nanovehicle across the epidermis layer of skin to reach deep-seated melanoma sites. Tumor regression studies in a xenografted melanoma mouse model confirmed superior therapeutic efficacy of the nanovehicle through combinational PDT and targeted therapy. © Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-based cell-death pathway, has recently attracted great attention owing to its effectiveness in killing cancer cells. Previous investigations focused on the development of iron-based nanomaterials to induce ferroptosis in cancer cells by the up-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the well-known Fenton reaction. Herein, we report a ferroptosis-inducing agent based on arginine-rich manganese silicate nanobubbles (AMSNs) that possess highly efficient glutathione (GSH) depletion ability and thereby induce ferroptosis by the inactivation of glutathione-dependent peroxidases 4 (GPX4). The AMSNs were synthesized via a one-pot reaction with arginine (Arg) as the surface ligand for tumor homing. Subsequently, a significant tumor suppression effect can be achieved by GSH depletion-induced ferroptosis. Moreover, the degradation of AMSNs during the GSH depletion contributed to T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhancement as well as on-demand chemotherapeutic drug release for synergistic cancer therapy. We anticipate that the GSH-depletion-induced ferroptosis strategy by using manganese-based nanomaterials would provide insights in designing nanomedicines for tumor-targeted theranostics. © Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between promoter proximal transcription factor-associated gene expression and super-enhancer-driven transcriptional programs are not well defined. However, their distinct genomic occupancy suggests a mechanism for specific and separable gene control. We explored the transcriptional and functional interrelationship between E2F transcription factors and BET transcriptional co-activators in multiple myeloma. We found that the transcription factor E2F1 and its heterodimerization partner DP1 represent a dependency in multiple myeloma cells. Global chromatin analysis reveals distinct regulatory axes for E2F and BETs, with E2F predominantly localized to active gene promoters of growth and/or proliferation genes and BETs disproportionately at enhancer-regulated tissue-specific genes. These two separate gene regulatory axes can be simultaneously targeted to impair the myeloma proliferative program, providing an important molecular mechanism for combination therapy. This study therefore suggests a sequestered cellular functional control that may be perturbed in cancer with potential for development of a promising therapeutic strategy. © 2018Uncontrolled proliferation is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and is associated with perturbed transcriptomic profile. Fulciniti et al. explored the interrelationship between E2F transcription factors and BET transcriptional co-activators in multiple myeloma, reporting the existence of two distinct regulatory axes that can be synergistically targeted to impact myeloma growth and survival. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Enlargement of the lymphatic vascular network in tumor-draining lymph nodes (LNs) often precedes LN metastasis, likely providing a lymphovascular niche for tumor cells. We investigated morphological and molecular changes associated with the lymphatic remodeling process, using the 4T1 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma models. Lymphatic expansion in tumor-draining LNs is mediated by sprouting and proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) as early as 4 days after tumor implantation. RNA sequencing revealed an altered transcriptional profile of LECs from tumor-draining compared to naive LNs with similar changes in both tumor models. Integrin αIIb is upregulated in LECs of tumor-draining LNs and mediates LEC adhesion to fibrinogen in vitro. LEC-associated fibrinogen was also detected in LNs in vivo, suggesting a role of integrin αIIb in lymphatic remodeling. Together, our results identify specific responses of LN LECs to tumor stimuli and provide insights into the mechanisms of lymphovascular niche formation in tumor-draining LNs. © 2018 The Author(s)Commerford et al. characterize the morphological and molecular changes that occur in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in tumor-draining lymph nodes (LNs) in two distinct tumor models. They show an upregulation of integrin αIIb in LN LECs and find that integrin αIIb mediates LEC adhesion to fibrinogen. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "There are acknowledged risks of metastasis of cancer cells and obstructing cancer treatment from hypoxia. In this work, we design a multifunctional nanocomposite for treating hypoxia based on the oxygen release capability of CuO triggered by microwave (MW). Core-shell CuO@ZrO 2 nanocomposites are prepared by confining CuO nanoparticles within the cavities of mesoporous ZrO 2 hollow nanospheres. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (IL) is loaded to the CuO@ZrO 2 nanocomposites for improving microwave thermal therapy (MWTT). 1-Tetradecanol (PCM) is introduced to regulate the release of chemotherapeutic drugs of doxorubicin (DOX). Thus, the IL-DOX-PCM-CuO@ZrO 2 multifunctional (IDPC@Zr) nanocomposites are obtained. Finally, IDPC@Zr nanocomposites are modified by monomethoxy polyethylene glycol sulfhydryl (mPEG-SH, 5 kDa) (IDPC@Zr-PEG nanocomposites). IDPC@Zr-PEG nanocomposites can produce oxygen in the tumor microenvironment during the course of tumor treatment, thereby alleviating the hypoxic state and improving the therapeutic effect. In vivo antitumor experiments demonstrate a very high tumor inhibition rate of 92.14%. In addition, computed tomography (CT) imaging contrast of the nanocomposites can be enhanced due to the high atomic number of Zr. Therefore, IDPC@Zr-PEG nanocomposites can be applied for monitoring the tumor-treatment process in real time. This combined therapy offers many opportunities, such as the production of oxygen from CuO nanoparticles by MW to alleviate hypoxia, the enhancement of combined treatment of MWTT and chemotherapy, and the potential application of CT imaging to visualize the treatment process, which therefore provides a promising method for the clinical treatment of tumors in the future. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Developing effective immunotherapies with low toxicity and high tumor specificity is the ultimate goal in the battle against cancer. Here, we reported a cell-membrane immunotherapy strategy that was able to eliminate primary tumors and inhibited distant tumors by using natural killer (NK) cell membrane cloaked photosensitizer 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrakis (benzoic acid) (TCPP)-loaded nanoparticles (NK-NPs). The proteomic profiling of NK cell membranes was performed through shotgun proteomics, and we found that NK cell membranes enabled the NK-NPs to target tumors and could induce or enhance pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages polarization to produce antitumor immunity. The TCPP loaded in NK-NPs could induce cancer cell death through photodynamic therapy and consequently enhanced the antitumor immunity efficiency of the NK cell membranes. The results confirmed that NK-NPs selectively accumulated in the tumor and were able to eliminate primary tumor growth and produce an abscopal effect to inhibit distant tumors. This cell-membrane immunotherapeutic approach offers a strategy for tumor immunotherapy. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "One of the hallmarks of cancer is the formation of oncogenic fusion genes as a result of chromosomal translocations. Fusion genes are presumed to form before fusion RNA expression. However, studies have reported the presence of fusion RNAs in individuals who were negative for chromosomal translocations. These observations give rise to “the cart before the horse” hypothesis, in which the genesis of a fusion RNA precedes the fusion gene. The fusion RNA then guides the genomic rearrangements that ultimately result in a gene fusion. However, RNA-mediated genomic rearrangements in mammalian cells have never been demonstrated. Here we provide evidence that expression of a chimeric RNA drives formation of a specified gene fusion via genomic rearrangement in mammalian cells. The process is: (i) specified by the sequence of chimeric RNA involved, (ii) facilitated by physiological hormone levels, (iii) permissible regardless of intrachromosomal (TMPRSS2–ERG) or interchromosomal (TMPRSS2–ETV1) fusion, and (iv) can occur in normal cells before malignant transformation. We demonstrate that, contrary to “the cart before the horse” model, it is the antisense rather than sense chimeric RNAs that effectively drive gene fusion, and that this disparity can be explained by transcriptional conflict. Furthermore, we identified an endogenous RNA AZI1 that functions as the “initiator” RNA to induce TMPRSS2–ERG fusion. RNA-driven gene fusion demonstrated in this report provides important insight in early disease mechanisms, and could have fundamental implications in the biology of mammalian genome stability, as well as gene-editing technology via mechanisms native to mammalian cells. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Unlike many other cancers, the relationship of CYP1A2*1F (rs762551) polymorphism with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk has not been assessed so far. To evaluate its association with ESCC, we conducted a case control study in Kashmir, India, a high risk region. We recruited 404 histopathologically confirmed ESCC cases and 404 controls, individually matched for sex, age and residence to the respective cases. Information was obtained on dietary, lifestyle and environmental factors in face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire from each subject. Genotypes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing randomly selected samples. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We found that mutant genotype (AA) of CYP1A2*1F polymorphism was associated with ESCC risk (OR D 3.11; 95% CI: 1.72–5.36). A very strong ESCC risk was observed in subjects who drank >1250 ml of salt tea daily and harbored mutant genotype of CYP1A2*1F (OR D 14.51; 95% CI: 5.33–39.47). The study indicates that CYP1A2*1F polymorphism is associated with ESCC risk and the risk is modified in salt drinkers. However, more replicative and mechanistic studies are needed to substantiate the findings. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Non-apoptotic ferroptosis is of clinical importance because it offers a solution to the inevitable biocarriers of traditional apoptotic therapeutic means. Inspired by industrial electro-Fenton technology featured with electrochemical iron cycling, we construct ferrous-supply-regeneration nanoengineering to intervene tumorous iron metabolism for enhanced ferroptosis. Fe 3+ ion and naturally derived tannic acid (TA) spontaneously form a network-like corona onto sorafenib (SRF) nanocores. The formed SRF@Fe III TA nanoparticles can respond to a lysosomal acid environment with corona dissociation, permitting SRF release to inhibit GPX4 enzyme for ferroptosis initiation. TA is arranged to chemically reduce the liberated and the ferroptosis-generated Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , offering iron redox cycling to, thus, effectively produce lipid peroxide required in ferroptosis. Sustained Fe 2+ supply leads to long-term cytotoxicity, which is identified to be specific to H 2 O 2 -overloaded cancer cells but minimal in normal cells. SRF@Fe III TA-mediated cell death proves to follow the ferroptosis pathway and strongly inhibits tumor proliferation. Moreover, SRF@Fe III TA provides a powerful platform capable of versatile integration between apoptosis and non-apoptosis means. Typically, photosensitizer-adsorbed SRF@Fe III TA demonstrates rapid tumor imaging owing to the acid-responsive fluorescence recovery. Together with ferroptosis, imaging-guided photodynamic therapy induces complete tumor elimination. This study offers ideas about how to advance anticancer ferroptosis through rational material design. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Featured with a large surface area, uniform interpenetrating mesopores, diverse organic framework hybridization, and well-defined surface properties, the hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticle (HMON) represents a promising paradigm in drug delivery systems with excellent biocompatibility. However, effective tumor accumulation and precise cancer theranostics of the HMON still remain a challenge. In this study, an \"ammonia-assisted hot water etching\" method is applied for the successful construction of sub-50 nm thioether/phenylene dual-hybridized HMON with low hemolytic effect. Particularly, the surface modification with Mo(VI)-based polyoxometalate (POM) clusters drives the self-assembly of HMON in the mild acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to achieve enhanced tumor retention and accumulation. More importantly, the reducibility-activated Mo(VI)-to-Mo(V) conversion within POM not only endows the POM-anchored HMON with outstanding TME-responsive photoacoustic (PA) imaging contrast and photothermal therapy (PTT) performance but also plays an indispensable role in controllably triggering the decomposition of the Mn 2 (CO) 10 payload for CO release, which gives rise to remarkable synergistic PTT-enhanced CO gas therapy for complete tumor eradication. By harnessing the unique acidic and redox properties of TME, the judiciously designed smart POM-anchored HMON nanoplatform is expected to act as a \"magic bomb\" to selectively destroy cancer without damaging normal tissues. This nanoplatform holds significant potential in realizing TME-responsive self-assembly for enhanced tumor accumulation and precise tumor-specific synergistic therapy, which is very promising for clinical translation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer radiotherapy suffers from drawbacks such as radiation resistance of hypoxic cells, excessive radiation that causes damage of adjacent healthy tissues, and concomitant side effects. Hence, radiotherapy sensitizers with improved radiotherapeutic performance and requiring a relatively small radiation dose are highly desirable. In this study, a nanosystem based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and ultrasmall black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) is designed and prepared to accomplish precise tumor radiosensitization. The PLGA nanoparticles act as carriers to package the BPQDs to avoid off-target release and rapid degradation during blood circulation. The nanosystem that targets the polypeptide peptide motif Arg-Gly-Asp-Gys actively accumulates in tumor tissues. The 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride shell decomposes in an acidic microenvironment, and the nanoparticles become positively charged, thereby favoring cellular uptake. Furthermore, glutathione (GSH) deoxidizes the disulfide bond of cystamine and sequentially triggers release of BPQDs, rendering tumor cells sensitive to radiotherapy. The treatment utilizing the PLGA -SS- D@BPQDs nanosystem and X-ray induces cell apoptosis triggered by overproduction of reactive oxygen species. In the in vivo study, the nanosystem shows excellent radiotherapy sensitization efficiency but negligible histological damage of the major organs. This study provides insights into the design and fabrication of surface-charge-switching and pH-responsive nanosystems as potent radiosensitizers to achieve excellent radiotherapy sensitization efficacy and negligible toxic side effects. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a typical biomarker plays a remarkable role in various human physiological processes. A sensitive and rapid method should be developed to realize the precise diagnosis of cancer at its early stage. In this work, we successfully synthesized the peroxidase-like graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and utilized it to fabricate an enzyme-free electrochemical immunosensor towards CEA by forming a single-wall carbon nanotubes@GQDs (SWCNTs@GQDs) composite. In addition to the SWCNTs@GQDs, reduced graphene oxide-Au nanoparticles (rGO-Au NPs) with the huge specific surface area and excellent conductivity were employed to modify the electrodes, leading to a dual-signal amplification result. Both the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed to evaluate the interface properties of the layer-by-layer modified electrodes. The proposed electrochemical immunosensor displayed a good specificity and sensitivity towards the detection of CEA ranging from 50 pg mL−1 to 650 pg mL−1 with a low detection limit of 5.3 pg mL−1. This simple and inexpensive immunosensor shows promising potential for the determination of other biomarkers in clinical translation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "With biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high functionality, silica nanoparticles (SNPs) have been widely investigated for various biomedical applications. However, lack of optical fluorescence has limited the application of SNPs as a degradable imaging agent. Here, we hydrothermally synthesized fluorescent SNPs by artificially generating optically active defect centers using tetraethyl orthosilicate and (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane. The synthesized SNPs demonstrated strong blue photoluminescence originating from the dioxasilyrane (=Si(O2)) and silylene (=Si:) defect centers with the aid of aminopropyl groups. Furthermore, phosphorescence was observed at 459 nm, indicating the presence of silylene in SNPs. Finally, these SNPs have been successfully utilized as a fluorescent probe for bioimaging of normal, cancer, and macrophage cells. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are widely implicated in cancer progression, and TAM levels can influence drug responses, particularly to immunotherapy and nanomedicines. However, it has been difficult to quantify total TAM numbers and their dynamic spatiotemporal distribution in a non-invasive and translationally relevant manner. Here, we address this need by developing a pharmacokinetically optimized, 64 Cu-labeled polyglucose nanoparticle (Macrin) for quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of macrophages in tumors. By combining PET with high-resolution in vivo confocal microscopy and ex vivo imaging of optically cleared tissue, we found that Macrin was taken up by macrophages with &gt;90% selectivity. Uptake correlated with the content of macrophages in both healthy tissue and tumors (R 2 &gt; 0.9) and showed striking heterogeneity in the TAM content of an orthotopic and immunocompetent mouse model of lung carcinoma. In a proof-of-principle application, we imaged Macrin to monitor the macrophage response to neo-adjuvant therapy, using a panel of chemotherapeutic and γ-irradiation regimens. Multiple treatments elicited 180-650% increase in TAMs. Imaging identified especially TAM-rich tumors thought to exhibit enhanced permeability and retention of nanotherapeutics. Indeed, these TAM-rich tumors accumulated &gt;700% higher amounts of a model poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) therapeutic nanoparticle compared to TAM-deficient tumors, suggesting that imaging may guide patient selection into nanomedicine trials. In an orthotopic breast cancer model, chemoradiation enhanced TAM and Macrin accumulation in tumors, which corresponded to the improved delivery and efficacy of two model nanotherapies, PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin and a TAM-targeted nanoformulation of the toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848). Thus, Macrin imaging offers a selective and translational means to quantify TAMs and inform therapeutic decisions. © Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "An enhanced near-infrared (NIR) FRET biosensing system based on the novel donor-acceptor pair (MnCuInS/ZnS@BSA and urchin-like Au NPs) was developed for the sensitive detection of HER2 protein. In this strategy, MnCuInS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were chosen due to their NIR emission, high quantum efficiency, and low toxicity. Amounts of MnCuInS/ZnS QDs were encapsulated in BSA to form MnCuInS/ZnS@BSA nanoparticles, which can easily transfer MnCuInS/ZnS QDs from organic phase into aqueous solution, and the formed nanoparticles were applied as the energy donor which significantly enhanced the fluorescence intensity. As for the energy acceptor, urchin-like Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) with novel structure, good stability and excellent quenching ability towards NIR fluorescence were selected. Thus, the NIR MnCuInS/ZnS@BSA and urchin-like Au NPs were designed as a novel donor-acceptor pair for FRET assay. By combining the optical advantages of NIR QDs encapsulated BSA nanoparticles with the excellent fluorescence quenching ability of urchin-like Au NPs, the proposed FRET-based biosensor realized enhanced FRET effect for highly sensitive detection of HER2 in human serum samples. A wide detection range (2–100 ng mL−1) and a low detection limit (1 ng mL−1) were obtained. This sensing system can decrease the interference of other biomolecules in NIR region, can be applied to other biomarker determination in vitro, and also shows great potential for in vivo diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The cell nucleus houses, protects, and arranges the genome within the cell. Therefore, nuclear mechanics and morphology are important for dictating gene regulation, and these properties are perturbed in many human diseases, such as cancers and progerias. The field of nuclear mechanics has long been dominated by studies of the nuclear lamina, the intermediate filament shell residing just beneath the nuclear membrane. However, a growing body of work shows that chromatin and chromatin-related factors within the nucleus are an essential part of the mechanical response of the cell nucleus to forces. Recently, our group demonstrated that chromatin and the lamina provide distinct mechanical contributions to nuclear mechanical response. The lamina is indeed important for robust response to large, whole-nucleus stresses, but chromatin dominates the short-extension response. These findings offer a clarifying perspective on varied nuclear mechanics measurements and observations, and they suggest several new exciting possibilities for understanding nuclear morphology, organization, and mechanics. © 2018, The authors.",

    "Abstract": "Systemic administration of antibiotics can cause severe side-effects such as liver and kidney toxicity, destruction of healthy gut bacteria, as well as multidrug resistance. Here, we present a bio-orthogonal chemistry-based strategy toward local prodrug concentration and activation. The strategy is based on the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder chemistry between trans-cyclooctene and tetrazine and involves a biomaterial that can concentrate and activate multiple doses of systemic antibiotic therapy prodrugs at a local site. We demonstrate that a biomaterial, consisting of alginate hydrogel modified with tetrazine, is efficient at activating multiple doses of prodrugs of vancomycin and daptomycin in vitro as well as in vivo. These results support a drug delivery process that is independent of endogenous environmental markers. This approach is expected to improve therapeutic efficacy with decreased side-effects of antibiotics against bacterial infections. The platform has a wide scope of possible applications such as wound healing, and cancer and immunotherapy. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Employing live cells as therapeutics is a direction of future drug discovery. An easy and robust method to modify the surfaces of cells directly to incorporate novel functionalities is highly desirable. However, genetic methods for cell-surface engineering are laborious and limited by low efficiency for primary cell modification. Here we report a chemoenzymatic approach that exploits a fucosyltransferase to transfer bio-macromolecules, such as an IgG antibody (MW∼ 150 KD), to the glycocalyx on the surfaces of live cells when the antibody is conjugated to the enzyme's natural donor substrate GDP-Fucose. Requiring no genetic modification, this method is fast and biocompatible with little interference to cells' endogenous functions. We applied this method to construct two antibody-cell conjugates (ACCs) using both cell lines and primary cells, and the modified cells exhibited specific tumor targeting and resistance to inhibitory signals produced by tumor cells, respectively. Remarkably, Herceptin-NK-92MI conjugates, a natural killer cell line modified with Herceptin, exhibit enhanced activities to induce the lysis of HER2+ cancer cells both ex vivo and in a human tumor xenograft model. Given the unprecedented substrate tolerance of the fucosyltransferase, this chemoenzymatic method offers a general approach to engineer cells as research tools and for therapeutic applications. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "α-defensin is a potent antimicrobial peptide secreted from intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, such as Paneth cells, and affects not only bacteria but also parasites and fungi. Recently, human eosinophils have also been shown to produce α-defensin, but no studies have been done on other animals. In this study, we attempted to detect α-defensin protein in mouse eosinophils infiltrating the intestinal mucosa during a helminth infection using Zamboni fixation and immunohistochemistry. Most of the eosinophils infiltrating the intestinal mucosa during helminth infection were positive for α-defensin. The expression level of α-defensin mRNA was 50 fold that in the control. Meanwhile, the number of Paneth cells was doubled, and their α-defensin fluorescence intensity was increased. These results suggested that eosinophils are also important producers of α-defensin, such as Paneth cells in mice, and that α-defensin produced from eosinophils might be involved in defensive mechanisms against helminths. Moreover, the experimental system used in this study is a good model to study the generation of α-defensin by eosinophils.",

    "Abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) play pivotal roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, but how the DCs regulate diverse immune networks on homeostasis breakdown remains largely unknown. Here, we report that, in response to epithelial barrier disruption, colonic DCs regulate the differentiation of type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells through p38α-dependent IL-27 production to initiate an effective immune response. Deletion of p38α in DCs, but not in T cells, led to increased Tr1 and protected mice from dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute colitis and chronic colitis-associated colorectal cancer. We show that higher levels of IL-27 in p38α-deficient colonic cDC1s, but not cDC2s, were responsible for the increase of Tr1 cells. Moreover, p38α-dependent IL-27 enhanced IL-22 secretion from intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cells and protected epithelial barrier function. In p38α-deficient DCs, the TAK1–MKK4/7–JNK–c-Jun axis was hyperactivated, leading to high IL-27 levels, and inhibition of the JNK–c-Jun axis suppressed IL-27 expression. ChIP assay revealed direct binding of c-Jun to the promoter of Il27p28, which was further enhanced in p38α-deficient DCs. In summary, here we identify a key role for p38α signaling in DCs in regulating intestinal inflammatory response and tumorigenesis, and our finding may provide targets for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal diseases. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Neurite outgrowth is the critical step of nervous development. Molecular probes against neurites are essential for evaluation of the nervous system development, compound neurotoxicity, and drug efficacy on nerve regeneration. To obtain a neurite probe, we developed a neurite-SELEX strategy and generated a DNA aptamer, yly12, that strongly binds neurites. The molecular target of yly12 was identified to be neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM), a surface antigen expressed in normal nervous system and various cancers. Here, yly12 was successfully applied to image the three-dimensional network of neurites between live cells, as well as the neurite fibers on normal brain tissue section. This aptamer was also found to have an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth between cells. Given the advantages of aptamers, yly12 hold great potential as a molecular tool in the field of neuroscientific research. The high efficiency of neurite-SELEX suggests that SELEX against a subcellular structure instead of the whole cells is more effective in obtaining the desired aptamers. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Stem cell therapy has been proposed to restore the function and structure of injured tissues. In the present study, we investigated the ability of human endothelial progenitor cells (hEPCs) to attenuate ovarian aging and dysfunction. Female ICR mice aged 4 and 6 months were injected with cultured hEPCs. Cultured hEPCs were injected intravenously twice with 5 × 104 cells with a 4 day interval. After pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation, oocytes and ovaries of aged mice were collected, cumulus-free oocytes were activated by SrCl2 and gene expression levels related to inflammation, apoptosis, follicle development and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in ovaries were compared. Administration of hEPCs attenuated the level of inflammatory cytokines and adverse apoptotic factor, as well as reducing ER stress in the ovaries. Increased cleavage and blastocyst formation rates and cell numbers in blastocysts from hEPCs-treated aged mice vs. same aged control mice demonstrated a protective function of hEPCs against reproductive aging. Based on these data, we suggest that treatment with hEPCs attenuates reproductive aging and dysfunction potentially via regulation of inflammation, apoptosis and ER stress.",

    "Abstract": "Overexpression of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is associated with several hepatic and vascular fibrotic diseases and tumor progression in some aggressive cancers. Secreted LOXL2 promotes extracellular matrix cross-linking by catalyzing the oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine. A great deal remains to be learned about the post-translational modifications of LOXL2, including whether such modifications modulate enzymatic and disease-promoting activities; such knowledge would inform the development of potential therapies. We discovered that upon secretion in cell culture, LOXL2 undergoes proteolytic processing of the first two of four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains at the N-terminus. A similar pattern of processing was also evident in tissue extracts from an invasive ductal carcinoma patient. Processing occurred at 314Arg-315Phe-316Arg-317Lys↓-318Ala-, implicating proprotein convertases. siRNA-mediated knockdown of proprotein convertases (furin, PACE4, and PC5/6), as well as incubation with their recombinant forms, showed that PACE4 is the major protease that acts on extracellular LOXL2. Unlike LOX, which requires cleavage of its propeptide for catalytic activation, cleavage of LOXL2 was not essential for tropoelastin oxidation or for cross-linking of collagen type IV in vitro. However, in the latter case, processing enhanced the extent of collagen cross-linking ∼2-fold at ≤10 nM LOXL2. These results demonstrate an important difference in the regulatory mechanisms for LOX and LOXL2 catalytic activity. Moreover, they pave the way for further studies of potential differential functions of LOXL2 isoforms in fibrosis and tumor progression. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the reversible conversion of l-serine and tetrahydrofolate into glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. This enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in one-carbon metabolism, is involved in cancer metabolic reprogramming and is a recognized target of chemotherapy intervention. In humans, two isoforms of the enzyme exist, which are commonly termed cytosolic SHMT1 and mitochondrial SHMT2. Considerable attention has been paid to the structural, mechanistic, and metabolic features of these isozymes. On the other hand, a detailed comparison of their catalytic and regulatory properties is missing, although this aspect seems to be considerably important, considering that SHMT1 and SHMT2 reside in different cellular compartments, where they play distinct roles in folate metabolism. Here we performed a full kinetic characterization of the serine hydroxymethyltransferase reaction catalyzed by SHMT1 and SHMT2, with a focus on pH dependence and substrate inhibition. Our investigation, which allowed the determination of all kinetic parameters of serine hydroxymethyltransferase forward and backward reactions, uncovered a previously unobserved substrate inhibition by l-serine and highlighted several interesting differences between SHMT1 and SHMT2. In particular, SHMT2 maintains a pronounced tetrahydrofolate substrate inhibition even at the alkaline pH characteristic of the mitochondrial matrix, whereas with SHMT1 this is almost abolished. At this pH, SHMT2 also shows a catalytic efficiency that is much higher than that of SHMT1. These observations suggest that such different properties represent an adaptation of the isoforms to the respective cellular environments and that substrate inhibition may be a form of regulation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Prodrug strategies that facilitate localized and controlled activity of small-molecule therapeutics can reduce systemic exposure and improve pharmacokinetics, yet limitations in activation chemistry have made it difficult to assign tunable multifunctionality to prodrugs. Here, we present the design and application of a modular small-molecule caging strategy that couples bioorthogonal cleavage with a self-immolative linker and an aliphatic anchor. This strategy leverages recently discovered in vivo catalysis by a nanoencapsulated palladium compound (Pd-NP), which mediates alloxylcarbamate cleavage and triggers release of the activated drug. The aliphatic anchor enables &gt;90% nanoencapsulation efficiency of the prodrug, while also allowing &gt;104-fold increased cytotoxicity upon prodrug activation. We apply the strategy to a prodrug formulation of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), demonstrating its ability to target microtubules and kill cancer cells only after selective activation by Pd-NP. Computational pharmacokinetic modeling provides a mechanistic basis for the observation that the nanotherapeutic prodrug strategy can lead to more selective activation in the tumor, yet in a manner that is more sensitive to variable enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects. Combination treatment with the nanoencapsulated MMAE prodrug and Pd-NP safely blocks tumor growth, especially when combined with a local radiation therapy regimen that is known to improve EPR effects, and represents a conceptual step forward in prodrug design. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Mass spectrometry imaging is a valuable tool for visualizing the localization of drugs in tissues, a critical issue especially in cancer pharmacology where treatment failure may depend on poor drug distribution within the tumours. Proper preprocessing procedures are mandatory to obtain quantitative data of drug distribution in tumours, even at low intensity, through reliable ion peak identification and integration. We propose a simple preprocessing and quantification pipeline. This pipeline was designed starting from classical peak integration methods, developed when “microcomputers” became available for chromatography, now applied to MSI. This pre-processing approach is based on a novel method using the fixed mass difference between the analyte and its 5 d derivatives to set up a mass range gate. We demonstrate the use of this pipeline for the evaluating the distribution of the anticancer drug paclitaxel in tumour sections. The procedure takes advantage of a simple peak analysis and allows to quantify the drug concentration in each pixel with a limit of detection below 0.1 pmol mm-2 or 10 μg g−1. Quantitative images of paclitaxel distribution in different tumour models were obtained and average paclitaxel concentrations were compared with HPLC measures in the same specimens, showing &lt;20% difference. The scripts are developed in Python and available through GitHub, at github.com/FrancescaFalcetta/Imaging_of_drugs_distribution_and_quantifications.git. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Nobiletin, a dietary citrus flavonoid, has been reported to possess several biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the antileukemic effects of nobiletin and its underlying mechanisms on human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We demonstrated that nobiletin (0-100 μM) significantly reduced cell viability from 100.0 ± 9.6% to 31.1 ± 2.8% in human AML THP-1 cell line. Nobiletin arrested cell cycle progression in G1 phase and induced myeloid cell differentiation in human AML cells. Microarray analysis showed that mRNA expression of the c-KIT gene, a critical proto-oncogene associated with leukemia progression, was dramatically reduced in nobiletin-treated AML cells. Furthermore, we verified that AML cells treated with nobiletin (40 and 80 μM) for 48 h markedly suppressed c-KIT mRNA expression (from 1.00 ± 0.07-fold to 0.62 ± 0.08- and 0.30 ± 0.05-fold) and reduced the level of c-KIT protein expression (from 1.00 ± 0.11-fold to 0.60 ± 0.15- and 0.34 ± 0.05-fold) by inhibition of KIT promoter activity. The knockdown of c-KIT expression by shRNA attenuated cancer cell growth and induced cell differentiation. Moreover, we found that the overexpression of c-KIT abolished nobiletin-mediated cell growth inhibition in leukemia cells. These results indicate that nobiletin exerts antileukemic effects through the down-regulation of c-KIT gene expression in AML cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the combination of a conventional AML chemotherapeutic agent, cytarabine, with nobiletin resulted in more reduction of cell viability in AML cells. Our current findings suggest that nobiletin is a novel c-KIT inhibitor and may serve as a chemo-preventive or -therapeutic agent against human AML. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Magnetic hyperthermia is a promising therapy for the localized treatment of cancer based on the exposure of magnetic nanoparticles to an external alternating magnetic field. In order to evaluate some of the mechanisms involved in the cellular damage caused by this treatment, two different 3D cell culture models were prepared using collagen, which is the most abundant protein of the extracellular matrix. The same amount of nanoparticles was added to cells either before or after their incorporation into the 3D structure. Therefore, in one model, particles were located only inside cells (In model), while the other one had particles both inside and outside cells (In&Out model). In the In&Out model, the hyperthermia treatment facilitated the migration of the particles from the outer areas of the 3D structure to the inner parts, achieving a faster homogeneous distribution throughout the whole structure and allowing the particles to gain access to the inner cells. The cell death mechanism activated by the magnetic hyperthermia treatment was different in both models. Necrosis was observed in the In model and apoptosis in the In&Out model 24 h after the hyperthermia application. This was clearly correlated with the amount of nanoparticles located inside the cells. Thus, the combination of both 3D models allowed us to demonstrate two different roles of the magnetic particles during the hyperthermia treatment: (i) The modulation of the cell death mechanism depending on the amount of intracellular particles and (ii) the disruption of the collagen matrix caused by the extracellular nanoparticles.

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to exert crucial roles in tumorigenesis and can serve as novel biomarkers for cancer therapy including lung cancer. Cisplatin is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the therapeutic effect is unsatisfactory, partly due to drug resistance. Emerging evidence showed that chemo-resistance is associated with acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties. Cisplatin resistance remains a major obstacle in the treatment of lung cancer, and its mechanism is still not fully elucidated. Meanwhile, CSCs have been involved in tumor metastasis, tumor recurrence and chemotherapy resistance. So far, the mechanism of nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in modulating CSCs in lung cancer remains barely known. Therefore, we aimed to explore the correlation between NEAT1 and cancer stem cells in lung cancer. In our current study, we observed that CSC-like traits were much more enriched in cisplatin-resistant A549/CDDP cells. In addition, NEAT1 was obviously up-regulated in A549/CDDP cells compared with parental A549 cells. Knockdown of NEAT1 decreased the CSC-like properties of A549/CDDP cells through inhibiting tumor cell sphere volume, repressing CSC-like biomarkers levels and restraining CD44 positive cell ratios. Oppositely, overexpression of NEAT1 enhanced the stemness respectively. Moreover, it has been reported that Wnt pathway is implicated in many vital cellular functions including cancer stem cells. Here, it was exhibited that Wnt signal pathway was inactivated by knockdown of NEAT1 whereas activated by NEAT1 overexpression in A549/CDDP cells. Taken these together, it was indicated that NEAT1 could exert a novel biological role in NSCLC chemo-resistance. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic value of preoperative serum tumor markers combined with peripheral blood routine indexes in colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: From January 2010 to March 2013, clinicopathological data of colorectal cancer patients receiving surgery treatment at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were collected. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma; (2) primary cancer resected; (3) intact clinical data; (4) no signs of clinical infection. Patients with intestinal perforation or obstruction, hematological diseases or other malignant tumors were excluded. Informations were recorded containing sex, age, tumor location, degree of differentiation, tumor size, vascular tumor thrombus, nerve invasion, depth of infiltration, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, TNM stage, peripheral serum CEA, CA199, number of neutrophil, monocyte, platelet and lymphocyte. Positive CEA was defined as ≥5 μg/L, CA199 as ≥35 U/L; while NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), MLR (monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio), PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) greater than their cut-off values were defined as positive. ROC curve was used to determine the cut-off values (with greatest area under curve) of NLR, MLR and PLR. The prognostic values of these indexes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier regression and log-rank test. COX regression was used to perform risk factor analysis. RESULTS: A total of 312 colorectal cancer patients were enrolled, including 192 males and 120 females with median age of 61 (15-85) years. Till March 11, 2018, during median follow-up period of 65 months(2-96), the follow-up rate was 90.4% with loss of 30 cases and the mortality was 37.2% with 116 death. Univariate analysis found that colorectal cancer patients with positive CEA, CA199, NLR (>2.32), MLR (>0.24) and PLR (>164.1) had poor prognosis (all P<0.01). When combining CEA, CA199 with NLR, MLR, PLR, the survival analysis showed that patients with both negative indexes had the best prognosis, one positive the worse and both positive were the worst (all P<0.01). COX regression revealed that CEA(HR= 1.702,95%CI:1.148-2.522, P<0.01), combination of CA199 and MLR (HR=2.292, 95%CI:1.426-3.683, P<0.01) were independent risk factors for colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Combination of preoperative serum tumor markers and peripheral blood routine indexes can provide prognostic information for the patients with colorectal cancer.",

After treatment, the gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 was detected at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after culture, in vitro cell activity, cell apoptosis assays were performed by CCK-8 and Annexinv-FITC, respectively, to elucidate biological effects of miRNA-433, and After 72 h of culture, the ERK1/2 detected their protein expression were quantified by BCA method. Result: The growth activity of BGC-823+ miR-433 cells cultured in vitro was significantly lower than that of BGC-823 cells and BGC-823+ miR-433 negative control cells at 48 h and 72 h; BGC-823+ miR-433 cell apoptosis index was significantly increased at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h; the expression of ERK1/2 was significantly lower than BGC-823 cells and BGC-823+ miR-433 negative contral after 72 h culture. There were no significant differences between BGC-823+ miR-433 negative control cells and BGC-823 cells. Conclusion: ERK plays an important role in the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells induced by miR-433. Copyright © 2018 by the Chinese Medical Association.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients over 65 years old. METHODS: Clinical, pathological and follow-up data of 188 gastric cancer patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy at Department IV of Gastrointestinal Cancer Center, Peking University Cancer Hospital, from April 2009 to December 2016 were collected for a retrospective cohort study. INCLUSION CRITERIA: ECOG performance score 0-1; preoperative gastroscopy discovered gastric masses, and pathological biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma; distant metastases were excluded by image examination; preoperative cardiopulmonary function was normal; preoperative blood routine test, liver and renal function, and coagulation function were normal; laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy was performed. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: intraoperative laparoscopic exploration indicated abdominal and/or pelvic peritoneal metastasis; free cancer cells in peritoneal cavity; conversion to laparotomy during laparoscopic surgery. Patients were divided by age into 2 groups, ≥ 65 years old group(59 cases) and < 65 years old group (129 cases). The perioperative conditions and postoperative complications between two groups were compared, and the high risk factors of postoperative complications in patients over 65 years old were analyzed. RESULTS: All the patients were operated by the same operation team. The incidence of comorbidities was 44.1%(26/59) in the ≥ 65 years old group, which was significantly higher than 20.2% (26/129) in the < 65 years old group (χ²=11.570, P=0.001). The incidence of cardia/fundus cancer was 64.4%(38/59) in the ≥ 65 years old group, which was also significantly higher than 40.3% (52/129) in the < 65 years old group (χ²=16.625, P=0.001). The number of retrieved lymph nodes in the ≥65 years old group was significantly lower than that in the < 65 years old group (28.9±10.7 vs. 36.1±15.4, t=3.271, P=0.001). The total morbidity of complications was 13.8%(21/188) and the mortality within 30 days after operation was 1.6%(3/188). The morbidity of postoperative complications and the mortality within 30 days after operation were 20.3%(12/59) and 3.4%(2/59,respectively) in the ≥ 65 years old group, which were slightly higher than those in the <65 years old group [10.9%(14/129) and 0.8%(1/129)], without significant difference(both P>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative comorbidities(OR=0.223, 95%CI:0.053 to 0.944, P=0.041) was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications in patients aged ≥ 65 years old undergoing laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy. The median survival time was 21.3 months and the overall 5-year survival rate was 50.0%. The 5-year survival rate was 45.5% and 57.5% in patients aged ≥ 65 and < 65 years, respectively, and there was no significant difference(P=0.205). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy is safe and effective in the treatment of gastric cancer patients ≥ 65 years old. Age is not a contraindication of laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy.",

    "Abstract": "Angiogenesis is fundamental for solid tumor growth and metastasis, and anti-angiogenic therapy has been an important therapeutic option for cancer treatment. Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The current studies were aimed at investigating the anti-angiogenic effects of the natural compound 4′-hydroxywogonin (4′-HW) on CRC-related angiogenesis. Human CRC cell line SW620 cells and normal human intestinal epithelial HIEC cells were cultured and treated with interleukin-6 to mimic the tumor inflammatory microenvironment. Our data showed that 4′-HW reduced the viability of SW620 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. 4′-HW also suppressed the proliferation of SW620 cells, but had little effect on the viability of HIEC cells. Moreover, 4′-HW concentration-dependently decreased the mRNA and protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), the predominant pro-angiogenic cytokine in tumor angiogenesis. Subsequently, 4′-HW concentration-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, similar to 4′-HW, significantly downregulated the VEGF-A expression in SW620 cells, and combination of wortmannin and 4′-HW produced more significant effects. Finally, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with the conditioned medium of 4′-HW-treated SW620 cells exhibited impaired angiogenic capacity at Matrigel. Incubation with the neutralizing antibody against VEGF-Aalone also suppressed the angiogenic properties of HUVECs in vitro. Collectively, 4′-HW decreased the viability and reduced angiogenesis in CRC, which was associated with downregulation of VEGF-A expression by disrupting the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our discoveries suggested 4′-HW as a promising anticancer agent against CRC targeting angiogenesis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at different time-points on postoperative gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: Eighty patients with colorectal cancer undergoing laparotomy were randomly assigned to intravenous anesthesia, EA A, EA B, and EA C groups (n＝20 cases in each group). All the patients in the four groups received intravenous anesthesia with midazolam, sufentanil, cisatracurium besylate and Propofol, postoperative gastrointestinal decompression and drug analgesia. EA (2－3 mA, 2 Hz) was applied to Zhongwan (CV 12) and Tianshu (ST 25), Neiguan (PC 6), Zusanli (ST 36), Shangjuxu (ST 37), Xiajuxu (ST 39) on the right side for 30 min, once (one day before surgery) in the EA A group, twice (one day and 30 min before surgery) in the EA B group, and 3 times (one day, 30 min before and one day after surgery) in the EA C group. The acupoints used after surgery were PC 6, ST 36, ST 37 and ST 39. The time of postoperative ventilation, defecation, food-intake and water drinking, stomach tube removal and abdominal drainage tube removal, the volumes of stomach tube drainage and abdominal drainage, and postoperative adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: The first ventilation time, after surgery in the EA C group was significantly earlier than those in the intravenous anesthesia, EA A and EA B groups (P<0.05); and the water intake and abdomicnal drainage tube removal time after surgery in the EA C group were significantly earlier than those in the intravenous anesthesia group (P<0.05). No significant differences were found among the 4 groups in the time of defecation, food intake, stomach tube removal, stomach tube drainage and abdominal drainage volumes, and numbers of patients with nausea, vomiting, fever and other adverse reactions (P>0.05)．. CONCLUSION: EA treatment combined with intravenous anesthesia conducted before and after surgery is effective in promoting the recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing colorectal cancer laparotomy, and is obviously better than simple pre-operative EA.",

    "Abstract": "旨在探讨IFN-γ 诱导乳腺癌细胞株MDA-MB-231 表面程序性死亡配体 (PD-L1)的表达、对上皮间质转化的影响及其分子机制。用不同浓度IFN-γ 作用MDA-MB-231 细胞后，利用蛋白质免疫印迹检测PD-L1、细胞迁移相关蛋白 (E-钙黏蛋白、N-钙黏蛋白、波形蛋白)、ERK、p-ERK、Jak2 及p-Jak2 的表达水平；通过细胞划痕实验和Transwell 实验检测细胞迁移能力；利用免疫荧光实验进一步检测细胞迁移相关蛋白的表达量。结果表明，IFN-γ 可上调PD-L1 的表达，使细胞划痕融合率显著增高，细胞迁移速率显著加快；波形蛋白和N-钙黏蛋白的表达量升高，E-钙黏蛋白表达量下降；ERK、p-ERK、Jak2 及p-Jak2 表达水平显著增加。加U0126 后PD-L1、ERK 及p-ERK 表达水平下降，而加入AG490 后，PD-L1、Jak2、p-Jak2 表达水平下降。结果表明IFN-γ 能上调乳腺癌细胞PD-L1 表达水平，促进肿瘤细胞迁移，促使细胞从上皮向间质转化，而这一过程可能与ERK 及Jak2-STAT 信号通路相关。.To investigate the effect of INF-γ on the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the potential mechanism in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, the cells were treated with different concentrations of INF-γ. The expressions of proteins, including PD-L1, cell-migration-related proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin), ERK, p-ERK, Jak2, and p-Jak2 were detected by Western blotting analysis and immunofluorescent staining assay. Cell migration was studied through cell wound healing assay and transwell assay. IFN-γ could up-regulate the expressions of PD-L1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cell migration rate was significantly increased after adding IFN-γ. The expression levels of vimentin and N-cadherin were increased whereas the expression of E-cadherin was decreased after adding IFN-γ. The expression levels of ERK, p-ERK, Jak2 and p-Jak2 were significantly increased and this phenomenon was inhibited when adding ERK inhibitor U0126 or Jak2 inhibitor AG490. These results demonstrate that IFN-γ could up-regulate the expression of PD-L1, promote cell migration and transmission, and facilitate epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of breast cancer cells and this process may be related with ERK and Jak2-STAT signaling pathways.",

    "Abstract": "Metastatic Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains a difficult oncologic challenge. Salinomycin is a monocarboxylic polyether antibiotic, which has been proved to possess anti-tumor activities in multiple types of cancer cells. However, its effects on RCC cells remains unclear. In our study, salinomycin could inhibit the proliferation and viability of RCC cell lines 786-O and ACHN. The TUNEL assay revealed that treatment with salinomycin induced DNA breaking in RCC cells. Consistently, Western blotting showed up-regulation of pro-apoptotic biomarkers (cleaved caspase3/9 and cleaved PARP1) and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic biomarker (survivin) in RCC cells after salinomycin treatment, suggesting that salinomycin could induce RCC cell apoptosis. salinomycin treatment also suppressed the sphere formation ability of RCC cells and decreased the expressions of CD105, ALDH1 and CD44, biomarkers for reflecting the stemness of RCC cells. salinomycin treatment effectively down-regulated SMO and Gli1, two key proteins in Hedghog signaling pathway, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, salinomycin could suppress the invasion and migration of RCC cells in the presence of TGF-β1, as observed in wound-healing and Transwell assays. salinomycin treatment attenuated TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by its ability to increase E-cadherin expression and decrease N-cadherin, Snail and MMP-2 expressions in RCC cells. Finally, salinomycin inhibited the tumorigenecity of RCC cells in vivo. Our study provides the evidence that salinomycin possess multiple anti-tumor activities against RCC, as it, in particular, suppressed the cancer stem cell properties and attenuated TGF-β-induced EMT. Therefore, it may serve as a potentially therapeutic candidate for metastatic RCC and improve the prognosis of RCC patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perioperative electrolyte imbalance in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: Retrospective case analysis was used in this study. Patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery under general anesthesia at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January to April 2018 were selected through electronic medical records system. Blood gas analysis during surgery must be carried out in the enrolled patients. Patients with excessive fluid infusion, critical conditions or patients who had been enrolled in other clinical trials were excluded. A total of 999 patients were enrolled. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative concentrations of serum sodium, potassium and calcium were collected by the last biochemical examination before surgery, arterial blood gas analysis within 1 h after anesthesia and another biochemical examination within 24 hours after surgery respectively. The type and incidence of electrolyte imbalance were then analyzed, and logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors. RESULTS: In the 999 patients, 683 cases were male (63.9%) and 361 cases were female(36.1%), with an average age of (56.9±14.6) years old. Fifty-eight patients (5.8%) underwent emergency surgery and 941 patients (94.2%) underwent elective surgery; Sixty-two patients were treated with laxatives at least 3 times and 115 patients were treated with enema at least 3 times before operation. The incidence of hypokalemia was 49.6%(496/999) intraoperatively and decreased to 15.2%(152/999) postoperatively. No hyperkalemia cases were found. The incidence of hypocalcemia was 53.8%(537/999) intraoperatively and increased to 79.7% (796/999) postoperatively. The incidence of hypokalemia in ileus patients was 33.3%(17/51) before surgery, which was higher than that in patients with colorectal cancer [12.3%(86/703)], patients with gastric cancer [7.8%(8/104)] and patients with other gastrointestinal diseases[10.6%(15/141)] (all P<0.05). Similarly, the preoperative and intraoperative incidence of hyponatremia in ileus patients were both 15.7%(8/51), which were higher than those in patients with colorectal cancer [3.0% (21/703) and 2.3% (16/703)] and patients with gastric cancer [2.9%(3/104) and 1.9%(2/104)]. The incidence of hypocalcemia in ileus patients was 31.4%(16/51) preoperatively, which were also higher than those in patients with colorectal cancer [7.4%(52/703)] and patients with gastric cancer [8.7%(9/104)] (all P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that ileus and emergency surgery were risk factors for patients with preoperative electrolyte imbalance; preoperative electrolyte imbalance was a risk factor for intraoperative electrolyte imbalance; intraoperative electrolyte imbalance was a risk factor for postoperative electrolyte imbalance; preoperative electrolyte imbalance was a risk factor for postoperative imbalance of sodium and potassium. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of electrolyte imbalance is high in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery, especially hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. It is necessary to recognize the electrolyte abnormality timely and give active intervention and correction.",

    "Abstract": "Dictamnine (DTM) is a natural alkaloid isolated from the root of Dictamnus dasycarpus Turcz and has been shown to exhibit multiple biological functions, including anti-inflammatory, antifungal, anti-angiogenic and anticancer activity. However, the mechanisms by which dictamnine inhibits tumor growth are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of dictamnine as a treatment for cancer and to identify the underlying mechanisms of its anticancer activity. Here, dictamnine showed the potent inhibitory activity against HIF-1α and Slug activation induced by hypoxia in various human cancer cell lines. This compound markedly decreased the hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF-1α and Slug protein in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis revealed that dictamnine inhibited HIF-1α protein synthesis, without affecting its degradation. Our results demonstrated that dictamnine reduced HIF-1α protein synthesis by downregulating the mTOR/p70S6K/eIF4E and MAPK pathways, and reduced the expression of Slug by inhibiting the GSK-3β/Slug signaling pathway. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was inhibited in dictamnine-treated tumors by downregulation of HIF-1α and Slug, as reflected by the upregulation of E-cadherin and Occludin, and the downregulation of N-cadherin and Vimentin. Phenomenological experiments showed that dictamnine reduced migration and invasion, inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation and promoted HCT116 cell apoptosis by downregulating HIF-1α and Slug. In vivo studies further confirmed that dictamnine treatment caused significant inhibition of tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model. These findings suggest that dictamnine is a potent cancer inhibitor, providing a rationale for anticancer pathway-targeted therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI), the most severe complication of coronary artery disease, develops in 2-4% of patients with various malignancies. PURPOSE: to explore the specific properties of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) course in patients with cancer and its effect on short-term outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included in this study 45 patients with STEMI and history of cancer hospitalized in the period from 01.01.2015 to 01.01.2017 (group I; 58% men, mean age 69.07±11.60 years). In the comparison group (group II) we selected 90 age and gender matched persons (58% men, mean age 68.16±11.75 years) from patients with STEMI without oncological diseases. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in main risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, except greater proportion of patients with damage of peripheral arteries in group 1 (22.2% compared with 5.6% in group 2, p=0.025). There were also no differences between groups in clinical characteristics at admission. However values of the following parameters were significantly lower in group I: concentration of hemoglobin (115.56±23.07 vs. 133.70±16.45 g/l in group 2, р&lt;0.001), red blood cell count (3.95±0.66x1012/l vs. 5.57±0.72x1012/l in group 2, р&lt;0.001), platelets (93±0.97x109/l vs 186±18.3x109/l in group 2, p&lt;0.001), total cholesterol (4.12±2.17 vs. 6.24±2.56 mmol/L in group 2, р&lt;0.001). There were differences in the frequency of use of antiplatelet drugs: at prehospital stage acetylsalicylic acid was given to 48.9% and 77.8% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.044); clopidogrel and ticagrelor were also significantly more rarely used in group 1. There was no difference in use of thrombolysis and percutaneous coronary interventions (4.4 and 53.3% vs 5.6 and 56.6% in groups 1 and 2, respectively). In group 2 greater portion of patients was given statins (68.9 vs. 77.8%, p=0.021) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (55.6 vs. 82.2%, p=0.008). Inhospital mortality was the same in both groups (4.4%). Occurrence of complications (bleeding, pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock), and frequency of use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, temporary cardiac pacing were similar. However in group 1 greater portion of patients had ventricular tachyarrhythmias (15.6 vs 2.2% in group 2, р=0.007); the presence of cancer was the only independent predictor of their emergence in multiple logistic regression (OR 8.11 [1.11-40.83], p=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of application of myocardial reperfusion in STEMI patients with and without history of cancer were the same. Despite similar hospital mortality revealed peculiarities of STEMI course could affect long-term outcomes. Confirmation of this hypothesis requires planned prospective studies.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the application among intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy(3D-CRT) and conventional radiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced middle-low rectal cancer. METHODS: From January 2015 to December 2016, 93 locally advanced middle-low rectal cancer patients with clinical stage cT3N+M0 or cT4N0/+M0 who underwent preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy at Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University and had complete data were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were divided into IMRT group (17 cases), 3D-CRT group (28 cases) and CRT group (48 cases) according to different radiotherapy methods. The frequency and dose of CRT were 1 time/day, 5 times/week, for a total of 5 weeks, with a single dose of 2.0 Gy, the total dose was 50 Gy. Frequency and dose of 3D-CRT and IMRT were 1 time/day, 5 times/week, for a total of 23 to 28 times, with a single dose of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy, and a total dose of 45.0 to 50.4 Gy. The chemotherapy regimen was performed with capecitabine tablets at a dose of 825 mg/m2 twice a day for 5 days every week, at the same time during radiotherapy. The efficacy, chemotherapy adverse reactions and immune function of the three groups were compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the baseline data among the three groups (all P>0.05). The proportion of patients receiving permanent ostomy in the IMRT group and the 3D-CRT group was 29.4%(5/17) and 32.1%(9/28) respectively, which was lower than 58.3%(28/48) in CRT group, and the difference was statistically significant (χ²=7.982, P=0.030), while this proportion was not significantly different between IMRT and 3D-CRT group(χ²=0.037, P=0.848). The pathologic complete response(pCR) rate was 23.7%(22/93) in the whole study, and the pCR rate was 39.3%(11/28) in the 3D-CRT group, which was higher than that of CRT group and IMRT group [12.5%(6/48) and 29.4%(5/17)], and the difference was statistically significant (χ²=7.407, P=0.025), while there was no significant difference in pCR rate between CRT group and IMRT group (χ²=2.554, P=0.110). There was no adverse reaction of grade 3 or above in all three groups. No significant difference in the incidence of bone marrow suppression, abnormal liver and kidney function markers, digestive tract reaction or radiation dermatitis was found(all P>0.05). After receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the proportion of CD3/CD4 cells in the IMRT group and the CRT group decreased compared with that before treatment(23.1±9.3 vs. 31.1±10.9, 27.4±10.7 vs. 33.6±7.2, respectively); the proportion of CD3/CD8 cells was up-regulated (36.1±15.2 vs. 24.8±10.9, 30.9±14.4 vs. 24.0±8.3,respectively), and the differences were statistically significant (both P<0.05), while the above indexes before and after treatment were not significantly different in the 3D-CRT group(all P>0.05). After treatment, the proportion of CD4/CD8 cells in IMRT group decreased (0.8±0.6 vs. 1.6±1.0, t=3.838, P=0.003), while this proportion was not significantly different in CRT group and 3D-CRT group(all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IMRT and 3D-CRT can reduce the rate of permanent stoma. 3D-CRT can increase pCR rate. No obvious advantage is shown in IMRT as compared with 3D-CRT in the short-term efficacy. On the contrary, an immunosuppressive status may occur. Therefore, 3D-CRT is recommended as the best preoperative treatment strategy for patients with locally advanced middle-low rectal cancer, especially for those with immunosuppression status.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility, safety and the economical efficiency of double-pouch anastomosis in laparoscopic radical rectal cancer assisted by small incisions. METHODS: Clinical data of 224 patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery at Taizhou People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province from January 2011 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Indusion criteria: patients were diagnosed as primary rectal adenocarcinoma by preoperative enteroscopy pathology, the distance of the tumor to anal margin was from 4 to 15 cm, and patients were treated with laparoscopic total mesorectal excision(TME) through small incision. Patients were divided into two groups according to different anastomosis method, double-pouch group(108 cases) and single-pouch group (116 cases). The surgical indexes, tumor safety indexes, short-term efficacy and economic indexes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between two groups in baseline data, operative time, blood loss, number of lymph nodes dissection, average length of proximal and distal bowel, or incidence of urination and sexual dysfunction (all P>0.05). Compared with the single-pouch group, the double-pouch group presented lower anastomotic secondary bleeding rate [0.9%(1/108) vs. 6.0% (7/116), χ²=4.238, P=0.040], lower incidence of anastomotic leakage[1.9%(2/108) vs. 7.8%(9/116), χ²=4.179, P=0.041], lower incidence of anastomotic stricture [1.9% (2/108) vs. 8.6% (10/116), χ²=5.054, P=0.025], shorter hospital stay [(13.4±3.9) days vs. (15.9±9.8) days, t=2.524, P=0.013] and less average hospitalization costs [(34 000±7 000) yuan vs. (46 000±23 000) yuan, t=5.047,P<0.001]. There was no significant difference in local recurrence, distant metastasis or overall survival between the two groups during mean follow-up of 33 months (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic TME assisted by small incision with double-pouch anastomosis is a safe, feasible and economical method.",

    "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor with highly invasive characteristic and low long-term survival. Recently, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is reported as a key event in cancer invasion and metastasis. Oridonin, a bioactive diterpenoid, has been proved to possess anti-cancer effects. However, the effect of oridonin on EMT and metastasis of osteosarcoma is unclear. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of oridonin on EMT and metastasis of osteosarcoma. We found that oridonin inhibited migration and invasion of MG-63 and 143B cells. Moreover, oridonin increased the protein expression of E-cadherin and decreased that of N-cadherin and Vimentin. Oridonin upregulated the transcription of E-cadherin and downregulated N-cadherin and Vimentin. Oridonin inhibited the protein and mRNA levels of Snail and Slug. Furthermore, oridonin inhibited TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad 2/3, prevented Smad dimer translocation into the nucleus. Finally, we established metastatic models of osteosarcoma 143B cells, and found that oridonin inhibited lung metastasis in vivo. Oridonin increased the protein expression of E-cadherin and reduced N-cadherin and Vimentin. Oridonin inhibited the protein expression of Snail and Slug as well as Smad 2/3 activation. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that oridonin inhibited EMT and TGF-β1-induced EMT by inhibiting TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway in osteosarcoma. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cycloicaritin is a bioactive natural phenolic compound from Epimedium species. However, the glucuronidation and excretion which would influence oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of cycloicaritin still remain unknown. Here we aimed to establish UGT1A1 stably transfected HeLa cells, and to determine the contributions of BCRP and MRPs transporters to excretion of cycloicaritin-3-O-glucuronide. First, β-estradiol was used to validate the expression of active UGT1A1 protein in engineered HeLa1A1 cells. Furthermore, Ko143 (5 and 20 μM) led to a significant decrease (42.4%–63.8%, p < 0.01) in CICT-3-G excretion and obvious accumulation (19.7%–54.2%, p < 0.05) of intracellular CICT-3-G, while MK571 (5 and 20 μM) caused a significant reduction (46.8%–64.8%, p < 0.05) in the excretion and obvious elevation (50.7%–85.2%, p < 0.01) of intracellular level of CICT-3-G. Furthermore, BCRP knocked-down brought marked reduction in excretion rates of CICT-3-G (26.0%–42.2%, p < 0.01), whereas MRP1 and MRP4-mediated silencing led to significant decrease in the excretion of CICT-3-G (23.8%–35.4%, p < 0.05 for MRP1 and 11.9%–16.0%, p < 0.05 for MRP4). By contrast, neither CICT-3-G excretion nor CICT-3-G accumulation altered in MRP3 knocked-down cells as compared to scramble cells. Taken together, BCRP, MRP1 and MRP4 were identified as the most important contributors for CICT-3-G excretion. Meanwhile, the UGT1A1 modified HeLa cells were a simple and practical tool to study UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation and to characterize BCRP and MRPs-mediated glucuronide transport at a cellular level. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Bcr-Abl 癌基因是由人类9 号染色体的c-Abl 基因与22 号染色体的Bcr 基因易位融合而成，其编码的融合蛋白Bcr-Abl 可以诱导人类白血病的发生。Abelson 鼠白血病病毒 (A-MuLV) 是一种逆转录病毒，其癌基因v-Abl可以诱导小鼠B 淋巴细胞癌变。Bcr-Abl 癌基因和A-MuLV 病毒的共同特点是表达Abl 癌蛋白 (Bcr-Abl 和v-Abl)。Abl 癌蛋白诱导肿瘤发生与多条信号转导通路的异常活化密切相关。这些信号转导通路主要包括JAK/STAT/Pim、PI3K/AKT/mTOR 和RAS/RAF/MEK。此外，Abl 癌蛋白诱导肿瘤发生也与重要信号分子的突变或异常修饰，以及关键长链非编码RNA (lncRNA) 的异常表达有关。文中对Abl 癌基因如何激活主要的3 条信号通路进行综述，并介绍参与细胞增殖、抗细胞凋亡等过程的重要蛋白及其与肿瘤发生的关系，为Abl 阳性肿瘤的治疗提供了科学参考。.The Bcr-Abl oncogene is produced by the reciprocal translocation between c-Abl gene on chromosome 9 and the Bcr gene on chromosome 22 in human genome. The encoded Bcr-Abl fusion protein is responsible for the pathogenesis of certain human leukemias. Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) is a retrovirus that could lead to transformation of B lymphocyte in mice, and v-Abl is the oncogene of A-MuLV. Abl oncoproteins (such as Bcr-Abl and v-Abl) play critical roles in tumorigenesis of certain cell types. Several signal transduction pathways, including JAK/STAT/Pim, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway, are involved in Abl-mediated tumorigenesis. In addition, Abl-mediated tumorigenesis is associated with mutation or abnormal modification of key signal molecules as well as dysregulation of some critical long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, we review the molecular mechanisms by which Abl oncogenes activate three major signaling pathways, and provide a scientific basis for therapy of Abl oncoprotein-induced tumors.",

    "Abstract": "The development of new targeted anticancer agents able to efficiently and specifically destroy cancer cells with minimal toxic side effects is nowadays a subject of intensive research endeavors. We report the conjugation of testo and testo-Pt(II) (two semi-synthetic testosterone derivatives) with calf thymus DNA in aqueous solution at physiological pH. Multiple spectroscopic methods, thermodynamic analysis and modeling were used to determine the binding efficacy of these drugs to DNA duplex. Thermodynamic parameters showed drug-DNA conjugation occurs via ionic interactions with testo-Pt(II) forming more stable DNA adducts than testo with Ktesto-DNA = 1.80 (±0.5) x 105 M−1 and Ktesto-Pt(II)-DNA = 2.3 (±0.8) x 105 M−1. Molecular modeling shows that testo and testo-Pt(II) bind DNA at different locations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "It is important for oral and maxillofacial surgeons to repair craniofacial defects on oral cancer patients or patients with congenital problems. Thus, it is a challenge to develop biomaterials that promote bone regeneration as potential materials for bone repair. This work is devoted to the fabrication of bioceramics composed of silica and titanium oxide with various concentrations of titanium oxide for developing bone repair materials for dentistry and tissue engineering. The silica-based bioceramics were synthesized using the sol-gel method, and titanium oxide was added from the hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate. The surface morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition was measured using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and the crystal structure was identified by using an X-ray diffraction diffractometer. The pH value and ion concentrations released in simulated body fluids after immersion with bioceramic samples were measured using a pH meter and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively. In the cell toxicity test, the human osteosarcoma cells (MG63) were used and quantitatively assessed using an MTT assay. The results showed that the proposed bioceramics can be controlled by tuning the Si/Ti ratio to modify the dissolution rate of samples and enhance the formation of apatite. Compared to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) groups, the cell number of the BG_Ti75 group can be increased to 120%. Furthermore, BG_Ti75 can promote MG63 cell growth with statistical significance and keep the pH value and the released calcium ion concentrations of the soaking environment stable. The proposed bioceramics show potential for bone-regenerating capability. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) in anal fistula. METHODS: A total of 2160 patients were clinically diagnosed with anal fistula at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from March 2010 to September 2015. Among them, 232 cases with operative history at other hospital, 218 with Crohn's disease, 6 with rectum cancer and 8 with other disease were excluded, and 1696 patients were finally enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. The saggital FSE T2WI imaging was confirmed based on the midline of body, and then the coronal and axial scanning line were confirmed. The key point was that the coronal scanning line must parallel and the axial scanning line must be perpendicular to the major axis of anal canal. The characteristics of anal fistula were recorded, and anal fistula were classified as five types, including intersphincteric, transphincteric, suprasphincteric, extrasphincteric and superficial fistula according to the Parks classification and our experience. The distribution of internal opening was described by using lithotomy position clock method. RESULTS: Of 1696 patients, 1456 were males and 240 females with median age of 26.5 (0.2 to 87.0) years. Age of 8.4% (143/1696) cases was under 20 years old, of 57.4%(973/1696) cases was between 20 to 40, of 28.4%(482/1696) cases was between 40 to 60, of 5.8%(98/1696) cases was over 60. The 1696 MR examinations included 1128 on 1.5T MR and 568 on 0.5T MR. Of all the anal fistulas was 29.0%(492) high position and 71.0%(1204) was low position. Among the 1696 patients, 1057 were intersphincteric fistulas(62.3%), 407 were transphincteric fistulas(24.0%), 68 were suprasphincteric fistulas(4.0%), 54 were extrasphincteric fistulas (3.2%), 67 were superficial fistulas(4.0%), and 43(2.5%) were difficult to classify. A total of 1996 internal openings were found and most of them were located around the dentate line of 5-7 o'clock in lithotomy position(47.7%, 952/1996). CONCLUSIONS: Anal fistula mainly occur in young men, and the most common type is intersphincteric fistula. MRI can accurately classify anal fistulas and clearly demonstrate internal openings, and provide reliable evidence for clinical treatment and surgery.",

    "Abstract": "Fasiglifam (TAK-875), a G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) agonist, was a drug candidate for type 2 diabetes. However, its development was terminated in phase 3 trials due to liver safety concerns. Although TAK-875 was reported to inhibit hepatobiliary transporters and disturb bile acid disposition, pathogenic mechanisms of TAK-875-induced liver injury are not fully understood. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanisms with a hepatic genome-wide transcriptomic analysis in a murine model. We demonstrated that, among the three GPR40 agonists, TAK-875, AMG-837, and TUG-770, only TAK-875 induced acute liver injury in mice. Transcriptome profiles of TAK-875-exposed liver was compared with those of non-hepatotoxic analogues AMG-837 and TUG-770 as negative controls and those of classical hepatotoxicants concanavalin A and carbon tetrachloride as positive controls. The comparative hepatic transcriptome analyses revealed the enrichment of genes involved in inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, apoptosis, and hepatic lipid accumulation, suggesting that these events play pathophysiologic roles in the development of TAK-875-induced liver injury. These results were validated by quantitative PCR with significant changes in chemokines, danger signals, ER stress mediators, proapoptotic factors, and hepatic steatosis markers only in TAK-875-exposed liver. Pretreatment of TAK-875-administered mice with an ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) alleviated the liver injury. Consistent with the in vivo study, pretreatment of HepG2 cells with 4-PBA significantly improved the decrease of cell viability induced by TAK-875. In conclusion, by a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis, we found multiple possible processes that contribute to TAK-875-induced acute liver injury in mice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the high risk factors of adult complex appendicitis, and to provide a reference for the development of a reasonable treatment strategy for acute appendicitis. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted to collect clinical data of 312 adult patients with acute appendicitis confirmed by pathology undergoing appendectomy, including open and laparoscopic surgery, from May 2011 to August 2016 at Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Age <14 years old, pregnant women, complicating abscess around the appendix, AIDS, blood system diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease or progressive cancer patients were excluded. According to the intra-operative findings and pathological types, patients were divided into complex appendicitis(112 cases, including gangrene and perforation) and non-complex appendicitis (200 cases, including simple and non-perforated appendicitis, ie suppurative appendicitis). After comparing the clinical data of these two groups, statistically significant variables were induded for multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors of complex appendicitis, and to establish a regression model. Enter method was applied to establish the regression equation: P=ExpiΣBiXi/1+ExpΣBiXi, and to calculate the relative risk of each variable. Meanwhile, retrospective and prospective verification was performed on this predictive model (cases of acute appendicitis from September 2016 to December 2017 were further collected). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of complex appendicitis were calculated with the regression model. RESULTS: Comparison of the clinical data between the complex appendicitis group and the non-complex appendicitis group showed that differences of 10 preoperative indexes were statistically significant, including period from abdominal pain to admission [(59.1±42.6) hours vs. (47.5±34.4) hours, t=3.051, P=0.002], white blood cell count [(12.9±3.7)×109/L vs. (9.2±4.0)×109/L, t=9.755, P<0.001], neutrophil count [(9.8±4.0)× 109/L vs.(7.1±3.9)×109/L, t=6.020, P<0.001], neutrophil percentage[(84.5±8.7)% vs.(68.2±16.0)%, t=12.754, P<0.001], C-reactive protein levels [(86.0±45.4) μg/L vs. (55.9±35.8) μg/L, t=7.614, P<0.001], serum albumin levels [(334.0±4.8) g/L vs. ( 41.0±4.3) g/L, t=16.055, P<0.001], vomiting ratio [44.6%(50/112) vs. 23.5%(47/200), χ²=14.980, P<0.001], high fever(≥39°C) ratio [16.1%(18/112) vs. 7.5%(15/200), χ²=5.577, P=0.022], the proportion of patients ≥60 years old [22.3%(25/112) vs. 13.0%(26/200), χ²=4.562, P=0.038] and previous history of appendicitis [16.1%(18/112) vs. 7.5%(15/200), χ²=5.577, P=0.022]. The above 10 variables were included in the logistic regression model for multivariate analysis. The results showed that six variables were associated with complex appendicitis. According to their strength, they were old age (≥60 years old) X1(OR=5.094), high fever (≥39°C) X2(OR=4.464), neutrophil count X6 (OR=1.269), neutrophil percentage X4 (OR=1.077), C-reactive protein level X5 (OR=1.027), and serum albumin level X3 (OR=0.763). A predictive regression model was established: P=1/[1+e(0.557+1.628X1+1.496X2-2.7X3+0.74X4+0.27X5+0.238X6)], whose sensitivity and specificity of judging complex appendicitis were 76.8%(86/112) and 90.0%(180/200),respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for predictive value of complex appendicitis in further prospective validation of the model were 76.2%(48/63) and 81.1% (30/37), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Age ≥ 60 years old, body temperature ≥39°C, increased neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage and C-reactive protein levels, and hypoalbuminemia are risk factors for complex appendicitis. The establishment of predictive model may help determine complex appendicitis.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) after abdominal surgery and to further evaluate the related risk factors of SSI in China. METHODS: The multicenter cross-sectional study collected clinical data of all adult patients who underwent abdominal surgery from May 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018 in 30 domestic hospitals, including basic information, perioperative parameters, and incisional microbial culture results. The primary outcome was the incidence of SSI within postoperative 30 days. SSI was classified into superficial incision infection, deep incision infection, and organ/gap infection according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. The secondary outcome variables were ICU stay, postoperative hospital stay, total hospital stay, 30-day mortality and treatment costs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of SSI. RESULTS: A total of 1666 patients were enrolled in the study, including 263 cases of East War Zone Hospital of PLA, 140 cases of Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, 108 cases of The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 87 cases of Central War Zone Hospital of PLA, 77 cases of West China Hospital, 74 cases of Guangdong General Hospital, 71 cases of Chenzhou First People's Hospital, 71 cases of Zigong First People's Hospital, 64 cases of Zhangjiagang First People's Hospital, 56 cases of Nanyang City Central Hospital, 56 cases of Lanzhou General Hospital of Lanzhou Military Command, 56 cases of Shandong Provincial Hospital, 52 cases of Shangqiu First People's Hospital, 52 cases of People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, 48 cases of The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, 48 cases of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 44 cases of Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, 38 cases of Hunan Province People's Hospital, 36 cases of Dongguan Kanghua Hospital, 30 cases of Shaoxing Central Hospital, 30 cases of Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, 29 vases of The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 27 cases of General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, 22 cases of Zigong Fourth People's Hospital, 21 cases of The Second Hospital of University of South China, 18 cases of Tongji Hospital, 15 cases of Nanchong Central Hospital, 12 cases of The 901th Hospital of PLA, 11 cases of Hunan Cancer Hospital, 10 cases of Lanzhou University Second Hospital. There were 1019 males and 647 females with mean age of (56.5±15.3) years old. SSI occurred in 80 patients (4.8%) after operation, including 39 cases of superficial incision infection, 16 cases of deep incision infection, and 25 cases of organ/interstitial infection. Escherichia coli was the main pathogen of SSI, and the positive rate was 32.5% (26/80). Compared with patients without SSI, those with SSI had significantly higher ICU occupancy rate [38.8%(31/80) vs. 13.9%(220/1586), P<0.001], postoperative hospital stay (median 17 days vs. 7 days, P<0.001) and total hospital stay (median 22 days vs. 13 days, P<0.001), and significantly higher cost of treatment (median 75 000 yuan vs. 44 000 yuan, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that male rise(OR=2.110, 95%CI:1.175-3.791, P=0.012), preoperative blood glucose level rise(OR=1.100, 95%CI: 1.012-1.197, P=0.026), operative time (OR=1.006, 95%CI:1.003-1.009, P<0.001) and surgical incision grade (clean-contaminated incision:OR=10.207, 95%CI:1.369-76.120, P=0.023; contaminated incision: OR=10.617, 95%CI:1.298-86.865, P=0.028; infection incision: OR=20.173, 95%CI:1.768-230.121, P=0.016) were risk factors for SSI; and laparoscopic surgery (OR=0.348, 95%CI:0.192-0.631, P=0.001) and mechanical bowel preparation(OR=0.441,95%CI:0.221-0.879, P=0.020) were protective factors for SSI. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative SSI in patients with abdominal surgery in China is 4.8%. SSI can significantly increase the medical burden of patients. Preoperative control of blood glucose and mechanical bowel preparation are important measures to prevent SSI.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prior research has established that the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants across all of the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) Secondary Findings (SF) genes is approximately 0.8-5%. We investigated the prevalence of P/LP variants in the 24 ACMG SF v2.0 cancer genes in a family-based cancer research cohort (n = 1173) and in cancer-free ethnicity-matched controls (n = 982). Methods: We used InterVar to classify variants and subsequently conducted a manual review to further examine variants of unknown significance (VUS). Results: In the 24 genes on the ACMG SF v2.0 list associated with a cancer phenotype, we observed 8 P/LP unique variants (8 individuals; 0.8%) in controls and 11 P/LP unique variants (14 individuals; 1.2%) in cases, a non-significant difference. We reviewed 115 VUS. The median estimated per-variant review time required was 30 min; the first variant within a gene took significantly (p = 0.0009) longer to review (median = 60 min) compared with subsequent variants (median = 30 min). The concordance rate was 83.3% for the variants examined by two reviewers. Conclusion: The 115 VUS required database and literature review, a time- and labor-intensive process hampered by the difficulty in interpreting conflicting P/LP determinations. By rigorously investigating the 24 ACMG SF v2.0 cancer genes, our work establishes a benchmark P/LP variant prevalence rate in a familial cancer cohort and controls. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The mechanism by which diabetes mellitus (DM) impacts the association between ABO blood types and pancreatic cancer is unclear. Material/Methods: A retrospective case-control study of 264 patients with pancreatic cancer and 423 age-and sex-matched individuals with nonmalignant diseases was performed to assess whether ABO blood group and DM jointly contribute to pancreatic cancer risk. Results: A multivariate analysis with adjustments for risk factors revealed that blood type, chronic pancreatitis, and DM were significantly associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk. The estimated adjusted odds ratios (AORs with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 2.130 (1.409–3.220) for blood type A, 2.383 (1.313–4.325) for blood type AB, 1.518 (1.012–2.276) for DM, and 10.930 (1.202–99.405) for chronic pancreatitis. Blood type A significantly modified the risk for pancreatic cancer in individuals with DM (AOR, 3.506; 95% CI, 1.659–7.409). Conclusions: The risk for pancreatic cancer was associated with ABO blood type, DM, and chronic pancreatitis in a Chinese population. The risk was greatest for individuals with blood type A and DM. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the anthracyclines-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data of 64 patients (aged from 36 to 59 years old) with early-stage breast cancer after surgery. Patients were divided into ACT group (n=21), FAC group (n=19) and EC group (n=24). The NCI CTC 4.0 scores was used to evaluate the side effects at the time of 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks after chemotherapy. Meanwhile, the level of cTnT, the incidence of abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were used to evaluate the anthracyclines-induced cardiotoxicity, the follow-up observation points were as follows: at the acute cardiotoxicity (time A), subacute cardiotoxicity (time B), 24 months after chemotherapy (time C), 36 months after chemotherapy (time D), 48 months after chemotherapy (time E), 60 months after chemotherapy (time F). The 3-years and 5-years overall survival and progress free disease survival among three groups were compared. Results: The ages, clinical stage, the size of tumor, axillary lymph node positivity and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Scores were similar among three groups (P>0.05); the incidence of side effects level 4 was 0. The levels of cTnT in the three groups were significantly lower than those at the baseline and time points C, D, E and F (all P<0.05), and the levels of cTnT were significantly higher in EC group than in FAC and ACT group at the time points B, C, D, E and F (P<0.05); however, the incidence of abnormal ECG and LVEF was similar among the 3 groups (P>0.05). The 5-year overall survival was 95.2% (20/21),100% (19/19) and 95.8% (23/24) in ACT group, FAC group and EC group, respectively; 5-year progress free disease survival was 95.2% (20/21),94.7% (18/19) and 91.7% (22/24) in ACT group, FAC group and EC group, respectively (P>0.05). Conclusions: Patients with early-stage breast cancer after surgery could tolerate the anthracyclines-induced cardiotoxicity. Three chemotherapy schemes of ACT, FAC and EC, especially the EC protocol, could affect the myocardial damage. However, outcome is comparable among patients treated with above chemotherapy schemes in this patient cohort. Copyright © 2018 by the Chinese Medical Association.",

    "Abstract": "Mathematical modelling as a useful technique to obtain a better and wider perception of a complex biological subject such as cancer, has been increasingly applied in recent years. Since the parameters of a mathematical model are obtained by observations and measurements, they are exposed to errors and have uncertainty and ambiguity in their nature. In this paper, in order to achieve a more realistic mathematical model of tumor growth, a system of integro-partial differential equations which describes the growth of a tumor characterized by the presence of cancer stem cells - which are the main reason of treatment failure and tumor relapse - is generalized to a fuzzy integro-partial differential system. Introducing some definitions, several theorems are proved to convert the fuzzy integro-partial differential system to an optimization problem. The proposed new method computes not only the approximate fuzzy solution of the full fuzzy system, but also the difference between the exact and approximate solution. It is further found that the tumor growth paradox appears in the full fuzzy mathematical model of tumor growth as well. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Quantitative toxicity-toxicity relationship (QTTR) models have a great potential for improving the meaning of toxicological tests conducted on simple organisms. These models allow predicting the toxicological effect of a chemical based on its known toxicological effect in different toxicity tests, even against a different organism. This fact poses a great potential for predicting the toxicity of chemicals against higher organisms based on the results against lower ones. However, the possibility of developing such models is often restricted due to the low availability of data. We present a case study of developing the QTTR model for ionic liquids in different toxicological tests against the same species, in the face of insufficient experimental data (an additional confirmation for a different species is provided in the Supporting Information). In the presented case, we use a series of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models developed to deliver the data concerning the toxicity of ionic liquids against human HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cell lines. We use these data to develop a QTTR model with an R2 as high as 0.8. The benefit of applying the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA - a genetic algorithm allowing for selection of the best set of explanatory features for several different dependent variables at the same time) as a QSAR model feature selecting strategy is presented and discussed. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Melanin remains one of the most enigmatic of pigments. It occurs in a variety of forms but is perhaps best known for its role in providing ultra-violet protection of skin as brown/black eumelanin and red/yellow pheomelanin. Despite decades of research, many questions remain about the structure, spectroscopy, and biology of both forms. For example, their unusually broad optical absorption spectra have attracted different explanations, no protomolecule has ever been identified, and pheomelanin has been implicated in melanoma, the most virulent form of skin cancer. Knowing more about the structure and spectroscopy of melanin is of paramount importance, not only in biology and medicine but also in the design of biomimetic functional devices. There is general consistency across a variety of techniques that eumelanin's building blocks arrange in π-stacked sheets analogous to graphite. By comparison, pheomelanin has been the neglected sibling and here we present evidence from fluorescence spectroscopy for pheomelanin also displaying sheet-like behavior. As pheomelanin is synthesized, the temporal response of the fluorescence intensity of the sheet-sensing probe thioflavin T (ThT) follows a similar sigmoidal increase as previously reported for eumelanin. Consistent with such intercalation, fluorescence decay measurements reveal evidence for close coupling between melanin and ThT excited states. © 2018 Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of mortality in the world. The detection of HCC in its early stage is the key for early treatment and thus the improvement of the chances of survival. Among the various methods of HCC screening, assays based on the detection of biomarker that is specific to HCC such as alpha-L-fucosidase (AFU) have been regarded as the most prominent methods. In this regards, a new assay for the detection of AFU to screen HCC was developed. This assay was based on the energy transfer between carbon dots (C-dots) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), the concentration of AFU could be monitored by the degree of C-dots fluorescence quenching due to the energy transfer. With this assay, a limit of detection of 3.4 nM (well below the diagnostic cutoff point of 80 nM), and a broad linear range of detection from 11.3 to 200 nM were achieved. We also demonstrate the determination of the concentration of AFU in human blood serum. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Primary pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoma tissue lymphoma is rare and is often misdiagnosed because of its diverse and nonspecific clinical features. The aim of this study was to raise awareness among clinicians and to share our experience of treating and managing such patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted between 1 January 2009 and 31 October 2017 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. All cases were confirmed via pathology and immunohistochemistry. In addition, we reviewed all relevant literature. RESULTS Altogether, 21 patients (7 female, 14 male) with a median age of 54 (range, 19-84) years were diagnosed with primary pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoma. Expiratory dyspnea, repeated cough and expectoration, and weight loss were the most common symptoms. Pulmonary lesions were found via physical examination in 10 patients who had no obvious symptoms. Chest computed tomography showed nodules, pulmonary consolidation, bronchial bronchogram, ground-glass opacity, and mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Some patients were misdiagnosed with tuberculosis and pneumonia, while others were initially diagnosed with cancer. Tumor pathology and immunocytochemistry indicated primary pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoma tissue lymphoma. Six patients underwent chemotherapy, 5 underwent surgery, 4 underwent surgery and chemotherapy, 3 were only observed, and 3 refused treatment. CONCLUSIONS The development of primary pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma is slow and insidious. Having no specific clinical symptoms and imaging findings, it is easily misdiagnosed. Final diagnosis is made via pathologic evaluation and immunohistochemistry. Surgery and chemotherapy are the primary treatment modalities and yield a good prognosis.",

Methods: Incidence and mortality data of gallbladder cancer in 2014 derived from registration data in 2017, collected by the National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR). Qualified data from 339 cancer registries were calculated after evaluating. According to the national population data of 2014, the gallbladder cancer incidence and mortality of China in 2014 were stratified by the area, gender and age.The age composition of standard population of Chinese census in 2000 and Segi's population were used for age-standardizes incidence and mortality in China and worldwide. Results: 339 cancer registries cover a total of 288 243 347 population including 146 203 891 males and 142 039 456 females (144 061 915 in urban and 144 181 432 in rural areas). The mortality to incidence ratio of gallbladder cancer was 0.74. The morphologically verified cases (MV%) and death certificate-only cases (DCO%) were 48.38% and 2.66%, respectively. Unclear diagnosis cases (UB%) was 0.48%. The crude incidence of gallbladder cancer in China in 2014 was 3.82/100 000, which accounted for 1.37% of new cancer cases (4.48/100 000 in urban areas and 3.01/100 000 in rural areas, 3.59/100 000 for male and 4.05/100 000 for female). Age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASR China) and world standard population (ASR world) were 2.38/100 000 and 2.37/100 000, respectively, and the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) was 0.27%.Besides, the crude mortality of gallbladder cancer was 2.86/100 000 (3.47/100 000 in urban areas and 2.12/100 000 in rural areas, 2.59/100 000 for male and 3.14/100 000 for female). Age-standardized mortality rates by ASR China and ASR world were 1.72/100 000 and 1.71/100 000, with a cumulative mortality rate (0-74 age years old) of 0.19%. Conclusion: The incidence and mortality of gallbladder cancer were significantly different between the city and country, while not obviously different between the female and male.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Defects in the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway sensitize tumors to therapeutics that target this pathway. A significant proportion of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) carry HR defects. The HRD assay is highly associated with sensitivity to neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in TNBC. Standard chemotherapy consists of some combination of an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and taxane. This study assesses the association of HR deficiency status with response to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC or BRCA1/2 mutation-associated breast cancer. Methods Tumor samples were retrospectively obtained from 45 TNBC patients and 2 BRCA1/2 mutant, hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients who received anthracycline-and/or taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy at Stanford University or Cedars-Sinai Medical Centers. The HRD score and tumor BRCA1/2 mutation status were determined from baseline tumor biopsies. HR deficient tumors were those with a HRD score of ≥ 42 or a tumor BRCA1/2 mutation. Response was categorized by the residual cancer burden (RCB) index. Results HR deficient patients were more likely to achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) compared with non-deficient patients (OR 13.06, CI 1.52–11.241, p = 0.0028). Among BRCA1/2 mutation wild-type patients, HR deficient patients were more likely to achieve a pCR (OR 16, 95% CI 1.65–160.41, p = 0.0041) compared with HR non-deficient patients. Further, HRD scores were highly concordant pre-and post-therapy (Spearman correlation > 99%). Conclusions HR deficiency status is significantly associated with response to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC. This observation is consistent with the mechanisms of action of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as DNA damaging agents. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2017.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 探讨血清游离DNA(cf-DNA)浓度及完整性在食管癌诊断中的价值。 方法： 收集68例食管癌患者、36例食管良性病变患者和45例健康体检者的静脉血标本。采用基于Alu序列的实时荧光定量PCR法(Alu-qPCR)扩增重复短片段Alu115和长片段Alu247，检测血清cf-DNA浓度和完整性指数，血清DNA的总水平以Alu115的含量表示，完整性指数以Alu247/Alu115表示。采用化学发光法检测血清癌胚抗原(CEA)和鳞状细胞癌抗原(SCC)浓度。分析血清cf-DNA浓度和完整性指数与食管癌患者临床病理特征以及CEA和SCC的关系。采用受试者工作特征曲线(ROC)评价血清cf-DNA浓度、完整性指数、CEA和SCC的诊断效能。 结果： 食管癌组、食管良性病变组、健康对照组血清Alu115的含量分别为1 162.0(817.8～1 652.4)、496.7(310.9～777.9)和432.3(198.4～634.1)ng/ml，Alu247/Alu115分别为0.57(0.51～0.65)、0.43(0.30～0.51)和0.42(0.33～0.48)。食管癌组血清Alu115含量和Alu247/Alu115均明显高于健康对照组和食管良性病变组(均P<0.01)，食管良性病变组与健康对照组血清Alu115含量和Alu247/Alu115的差异无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。食管癌患者血清Alu115含量与患者年龄、性别、肿瘤分化程度、美国癌症联合委员会(AJCC)分期及有无淋巴结转移无关(均P>0.05)，但Ⅲ期患者的血清Alu247/Alu115高于Ⅰ～Ⅱ期患者(P<0.05)，Ⅳ期患者高于Ⅲ期患者(P<0.05)。食管癌患者血清Alu115含量与CEA和SCC的水平无关(均P>0.05)，Alu247/Alu115与CEA和SCC的水平也无关(均P>0.05)。血清Alu115含量和Alu247/Alu115诊断食管癌的ROC曲线下面积分别为0.867和0.854，均高于CEA(0.622)和SCC(0.753)，Alu115和Alu247/Alu115联合CEA和SCC检测时，诊断食管癌的灵敏度可分别提高到95.6%和94.1%。 结论： 血清cf-DNA浓度和完整性检测有助于食管癌的早期辅助诊断和病程监测，对食管癌的诊断价值优于CEA和SCC。.Objective: To explore the diagnostic value of serum cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentration and integrity for esophageal carcinoma. Methods: Venous blood samples from 68 patients with esophageal cancer, 36 patients with benign esophageal lesions and 45 healthy subjects were collected. Circulating cfDNA was verified through quantitative real-time PCR (Alu-qPCR) using Alu-115 and Alu-247 primers. DNA integrity index was calculated as the ratio of Alu-qPCR results (Alu247/115). Concentrations of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma associated antigen (SCC) were detected by chemiluminescence analyzer assay. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test and Spearman correlation test. The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of each index to esophageal carcinoma. Results: The median absolute serum Alu115 and the Alu247/115 index (1 162.0 ng/ml, 0.57) in esophageal cancer group were significantly higher than those in benign esophageal disease group (496.7 ng/ml, 0.43) and in healthy control group (432.3 ng/ml, 0.42) (all P<0.01, respectively). The Alu115 and Alu247/115 index of serum DNA in benign esophageal disease group were no statistically different from those in the healthy control group (all P>0.05, respectively). The levels of cfDNA and its integrity were not significantly correlated with age, gender, tumor differentiation, or disease stage according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system in the esophageal cancer group (all P>0.05). The serum Alu247/115 index of Stage Ⅲ patients was higher than that of Stage Ⅰ~Ⅱ patients(P<0.05). The serum Alu247/115 index of Stage Ⅳ was higher than that of Stage Ⅲ(P<0.05). In the esophageal cancer group, both of serum Alu115 and Alu247/115 index had no correlation with CEA or SCC (all P>0.05). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of Alu115 and Alu247/115 index were 0.867 and 0.854, respectively, which were both higher than that of CEA (0.622) and SCC (0.753). The addition of Alu115 or Alu247/115 index to CEA and SCC detection increased the sensitivity of the diagnosis of esophageal cancer by 95.6% and 94.1%, respectively. Conclusions: The detection of serum cfDNA concentration and integrity is helpful to the early diagnosis and monitoring of esophageal cancer. Their diagnostic value of esophageal cancer is better than that of the traditional tumor markers CEA and SCC.",

In Beijing group 39.0% (32/82) of CIN2 + patients had clinical symptoms, which in Guizhou group was 31.6% (31/98). In Beijing group and Guizhou group, 50.0% (19/38) and 73.2% (30/41) patients with cervical cancer had never been screened, respectively. In Beijing group and Guizhou group, 5.4% (4/74) and 19.2% (10/52) of the patients with CIN2 + had cervical cytology negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), respectively (P=0.015). The cervical cytology showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) in 10.2% (13/127) and 24.6% (14/57), respectively, with significant difference (P=0.01). The cervical cytology showed low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) in 14.9% (11/74) and 37.5% (6/16) with no significant difference (P=0.08). Atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASC-H) were 41.7% (5/12) and 71.4% (20/28) with no statistically significant difference (P=0.15). High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) were 78.9% (15/19) and 86.4% (19/22) with no significant difference (P=0.83). In cases with HPV detection information, the sensitivity of CIN2+ diagnosis by high-risk HPV detection in Beijing group and Guizhou group was 95.2% (40/42) and 73.6% (39/53) that was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions: In both Beijing and Guizhou, the incidence of CIN2+ in elderly women is at a relatively high level. There were differences in the detection of CIN2+ by cervical cytology or HPV detection in Beijing and Guizhou.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lung cancer has become a leading disease for the tumor-induced mortality. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers. The present research aimed to evaluate the correlation between the anaplastic lymphoma kinase/oncogene or c-ros oncogene 1 (ALK/ROS1) fusions or mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ages or gender of patients. Material/Methods: Among 1449 NSCLC patients, 457 patients who were diagnosed as consecutive EGFR mutations or ALK/ROS1 fusions between November 2016 and February 2018 were involved in the present study. EGFR genes or ALK/ROS1 mutations were detected by using DNA sequencing technique and amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS). The mRNAs of ROS1 and ALK fusion were examined by using polymerase chain reaction technique and fusion gene detection kit. Results: Females were more often inflicted by the EGFR mutations, especially for the exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation. There were significantly more ALK/ROS1 fusions in females compared to males (P<0.05) and significantly more ALK/ROS1 fusions in <60 years of age patients compared to patients older than 60 years of age (P<0.05). Exon 21 L858R and L861Q dominantly occurred in patients ³60 years of age and exon 19 deletion in patients <60 years of age. EML-ALK-1 mainly existed in the female NSCLC patients. Conclusions: EGFR mutations and ALK/ROS1 fusions mainly occurred in the NSCLC female patients who were older than 60 years of age. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 探讨泛素羧基末端水解酶L5(UCHL5)在乳腺癌细胞增殖和凋亡过程中的作用。 方法： 以慢病毒介导的shRNA系统敲低SW527细胞中UCHL5基因的表达，采用MTS法检测UCHL5表达改变对SW527细胞增殖的影响，采用裸鼠皮下成瘤实验检测UCHL5对SW527细胞裸鼠体内成瘤能力的影响，采用annexinV－PI双染法检测SW527细胞的凋亡。以TCGA浸润性乳腺癌数据分析UCHL5的表达与乳腺癌增殖凋亡相关基因表达的相关性。以Kaplan Meier－plotter在线数据库分析UCHL5表达与乳腺癌患者预后的关系。 结果： 敲低UCHL5的表达后，SW527细胞第2、4天的A值分别为0.822±0.017和1.045±0.023，均明显低于对照组细胞在第2、4天的A值(分别为0.976±0.016和1.284±0.025，P<0.001)。在裸鼠成瘤实验中，UCHL5敲低后SW527细胞的成瘤体积为(166.90±75.05)mm(3)，明显小于对照组细胞的成瘤体积[(329.80±35.84)mm(3)，P＝0.029]。流式细胞术检测结果显示，敲低UCHL5的表达后，SW527细胞的凋亡比例为(8.60±1.13)%，明显高于对照组[(2.95±0.07)%，P＝0.020]。TCGA数据库分析表明，UCHL5的表达与细胞增殖相关基因的表达呈正相关，且随着UCHL5表达升高，促凋亡相关基因表达下降。Kaplan Meier－plotter分析显示，UCHL5高表达乳腺癌患者的总生存时间和无复发生存时间均明显短于UCHL5低表达患者(均P<0.001)。 结论： 敲低UCHL5的表达可抑制SW527细胞的增殖和裸鼠皮下成瘤能力，促进细胞凋亡，并且UCHL5的高表达预示着乳腺癌患者的不良预后。.Objective: To investigate the effect of UCHL5 on proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Methods: SW527 cells were infected with lentiviral vector carrying short hairpin RNA to delete the expression of UCHL5. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay was used to examine cell proliferation, and subcutaneous transplantation experiments were performed to detect tumor growth. Cell apoptosis was detected using Annexin V/ Propidium iodide (PI) double staining. The correlation between UCHL5 expression and the expressions of proliferation and apoptosis associated genes was analyzed using TCGA breast invasive carcinoma data set. The relationship between UCHL5 expression and breast cancer patients'survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter online tool. Results: After knockdown of UCHL5, A values of SW527 cells on day 2 and day 4 were 0.822±0.017 and 1.045±0.023, respectively, which were significantly lower than 0.976±0.016 and 1.284±0.025 of control cells on day 2 and day 4 (P<0.001). In vivo xenografted mouse model, the volume in UCHL5-suppressed group was (166.90±75.05) mm(3,) significantly smaller than (329.80±35.84) mm(3) in control group (P=0.029). Flow cytometry analysis showed the apoptotic rate of SW527 cells was (8.60±1.13)% after knockdown of UCHL5, significantly higher than (2.95±0.07)% of control group (P=0.020). TCGA database analysis showed that the expression of UCHL5 was positively correlated with the expressions of genes related to cell proliferation, in paralled with the increased expression of UCHL5, the expression of the pro-apoptosis associated genes was decreased. Kaplan-Meier Plotter analysis demonstrated that the overall survival and relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients with high expression of UCHL5 were much shorter (all P<0.001). Conclusions: Down-regulation of UCHL5 inhibits the proliferation and tumor formation and promotes apoptosis of SW527 cells. High expression of UCHL5 may predict poor prognosis of breast cancer patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Elderly patients with Ewing sarcoma have a very poor prognosis, and treatment remains a challenge. However, the outcomes and potential prognostic factors of elderly Ewing sarcoma patients are rarely documented. Therefore, we investigated the prognosis of this special cohort and determine independent prognostic factors. Material/Methods: A cohort of Ewing sarcoma patients aged over 40 years from 1973 to 2015 was identified from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox proportional hazard regression model were used for the prognostic analysis. Results: A total of 162 patients were included with a mean age of 53 years. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates of the entire group were 43.7% and 47.9%, respectively. The sex, location, tumor size, and radiation treatment had no effect on survival outcomes on univariate analysis. Tumor stage, surgery, and chemotherapy were significant indicators of both OS and CSS on multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Surgery in combination with chemotherapy had a significant survival benefit in elderly Ewing sarcoma patients and should be recommended. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Mucosal melanoma of the head and neck is a rare malignant tumor associated with a poor prognosis. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and biotherapy are common strategies for treating mucosal melanoma of the head and neck. Episcleritis is an idiopathic, immune-mediated disease, and is classified into two types: simple episcleritis and nodular episcleritis. Case presentation: In this case report we describe ocular changes involving simple episcleritis in a 65-year-old Chinese man with mucosal melanoma of the head and neck after treatment with interferon alfa-2b and radiotherapy. On the third day of interferon alfa-2b treatment, he began to develop simple episcleritis in his left eye. Moreover, the percentage of CD3 + T cells in lymphocytes from blood was increased after interferon alfa-2b treatment. After approximately 6 days, the symptoms of eye pain, hyperemia, and edema disappeared gradually. Then, after radiotherapy was performed three times, he again developed episcleritis in his left eye. The same symptoms of hyperemia and edema occurred again; CD3 + T cell frequency was also at a higher level. After approximately a week, all the symptoms disappeared completely. Simple treatment involving topical ofloxacin and phenylephrine was administered during the two periods of episcleritis. Conclusion: Episcleritis in this patient might have been due to the treatment with interferon alfa-2b and radiotherapy, leading to an increase in the level of CD3 + T cells and activation of immune system cells, which provides the guide for clinical clinicians. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "虽然近年来单克隆抗体、小分子靶向药物和免疫治疗等新药的应用明显提高了恶性淋巴瘤患者的近期疗效和长期生存，但造血干细胞移植在恶性淋巴瘤的整体治疗中仍然具有重要的地位。为提高临床医师对造血干细胞移植在恶性淋巴瘤治疗中作用和地位的认识，并规范其临床应用，以提高恶性淋巴瘤的整体治疗水平，中国抗癌协会血液肿瘤专业委员会联合中华医学会血液学分会白血病淋巴瘤学组和中国临床肿瘤学会抗淋巴瘤联盟的相关专家，制订了《造血干细胞移植治疗淋巴瘤中国专家共识(2018版)》。对造血干细胞移植治疗淋巴瘤的适应证、移植方式、造血干细胞动员和采集、移植预处理、移植前后治疗以及随访和监测等主要内容进行了详细阐述，以供临床医师参考。.Although addition of novel monoclonal antibodies, targeted therapies, and immune therapies have remarkably improved both response and long-term survival of malignant lymphoma, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains an important therapeutic option for lymphomas. In order to improve the understanding of the roles of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for malignant lymphoma and further standardize the clinical application, the Chinese experts from the Hematology Oncology Committee of China Anti-Cancer Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Group of the Society of Hematology at Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Union of Lymphoma Research of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology, have analyzed the related research data and developed the Chinese expert consensus on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for malignant lymphoma(2018). In this consensus, we have systematically expounded on the indication, type of transplant, mobilization and collection of hematopoietic stem cells, conditioning regimen, pre-or post transplant therapies and follow-up of HSCT for malignant lymphoma, in order to provide reference for clinicians.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen is a very rare benign vascular lesion recently described. Usually, sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen is an incidental finding; the association with malignant tumors is extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen associated with uterine clear cell carcinoma. Case presentation: A 49-year-old Arabic woman presented to our institute with abdominal pain and distention. An abdominal computed tomographic scan was obtained, which showed a 14-cm uterine malignant tumor and a 4-cm isolated splenic nodule suggesting a metastatic lesion. The tumor was limited to the uterus but did not extend beyond. The patient underwent surgical treatment, and the histopathological examination of the resected uterine and splenic specimens disclosed invasive uterine clear cell carcinoma and sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen, respectively. The patient had no signs of the disease 17 months after surgical treatment. Conclusions: Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen is a very rare benign disease with a misleading presentation when associated with a malignant tumor. Pathological assessment of the resected spleen is the only way to achieve the correct diagnosis. © 2018 The Author(s).",

Methods: 71 patients with adenocarcinoma at the junction of the lower uterine segment and endocervix were retrospectively collected. Pelvic MR examinations, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences, were performed within 2 weeks before surgery. MR images were analyzed and measured by two radiologists, including the location of the tumor center, the enhancement pattern, the anterior and posterior diameters, the left and right diameters, the upper and lower diameters, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the tumor. Immunohistochemical method was used as gold standard in distinguishing cervical adenocarcinoma and uterine adenocarcinoma. Results: The upper and lower diameters of uterine adenocarcinoma were [(5.80±2.31) cm], significantly larger than those of cervical adenocarcinoma [(4.16±2.17) cm, P=0.009]. Using 4.5cm as the best cutoff point value, the sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing uterine adenocarcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma were 68.4% and 65.4%, respectively. According to the location of tumor center, the sensitivity and specificity were 84.2% and 73.1%, respectively. Using tumor enhancement pattern as the criterion, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing uterine adenocarcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma were 68.4% and 80.8% respectively. Conclusions: MRI has certain clinical value in evaluating the origin of adenocarcinoma at the junction of the lower uterine segment and endocervix. The lesions can be diagnosed according to the main location, the characteristics of dynamic enhancement and the growth pattern of the tumor.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 利用营养风险筛查2002(NRS-2002)评分对术前胸段食管鳞癌患者进行营养状态评分，并探索其对患者长期生存的影响。 方法： 回顾性分析2010至2012年间在扬州大学附属泰兴人民医院胸外科接受食管癌根治术的117例患者，术前参照NRS-2002工具标准，进行营养状况和营养风险评分，并根据其中位值进行分组，分析NRS-2002评分与患者预后的关系。 结果： 根据NRS-2002评分的中位值将患者分为<2分组(45例)和≥2分组(72例)，NRS-2002评分<2分组患者的1、3、5年无进展生存率分别为75.6%、44.4%和40.0%，NRS-2002评分≥2分组患者的1、3、5年无进展生存率分别为61.1%、6.9%和4.2%，差异有统计学意义(P<0.001)。NRS-2002评分<2分组患者的1、3、5年生存率分别为97.8%、66.7%和57.8%，NRS-2002评分≥2分组患者的1、3、5年生存率分别为91.7%、33.3%和16.7%，差异有统计学意义(P<0.001)。单因素分析显示，N分期、TNM分期和NRS-2002评分均与胸段食管鳞癌患者的无进展生存时间和总生存时间密切相关(均P<0.05)，T分期还与胸段食管鳞癌患者的总生存时间有关(P<0.05)。Cox多因素分析结果显示，N分期(RR＝1.640，95%CI为1.049～2.565，P＝0.030)和NRS-2002评分(RR＝3.154，95%CI为1.946～5.113，P<0.001)是影响无进展生存时间的独立因素。分化程度(RR＝1.566，95%CI为1.004～2.440，P＝0.048)、N分期(RR＝1.624，95%CI为1.017～2.593，P＝0.042)和NRS-2002评分(RR＝3.906，95%CI为2.245～6.795，P<0.001)是影响总生存时间的独立因素。 结论： 术前NRS-2002评分是影响胸段食管鳞癌患者预后的独立因素，可作为营养风险的初筛工具。.Objective: To apply Nutritional Risk Screening-2002(NRS-2002) to perform nutritional status score for the patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) receiving surgery, and to explore the prognostic impact of long-term survival. Methods: A total of 117 patients who were diagnosed with ESCC from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. They recieved standard curative esophagectomy in the Yangzhou University Affiliated Taixing People's Hospital. The nutritional status and risk score for recruited patients were assessed according to the standard of NRS-2002 tool prior to surgery, and these patients were grouped for further analysis according to the median values of NRS-2002 score. Finally, the relationship between NRS-2002 score and prognosis was analyzed. Results: Patients were classified into two groups, with 45 in the NRS-2002<2.0 group, and 72 cases in the NRS-2002≥2.0, respectively. In the NRS-2002<2.0 group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 75.6%, 44.4% and 40.0% separately, while in the NRS-2002≥2.0 group, the PFS rates were 61.1%, 6.9% and 4.2% respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). Correspondingly, in the NRS-2002< 2.0 group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 97.8%, 66.7% and 57.8% separately, while in the NRS-2002≥2.0 group, the OS rates were 91.7%, 33.3% and 16.7% respectively, and the differences were also statistically significant (P<0.001). Univariate analysis showed that N stage, TNM stage and NRS-2002 score were closely related to PFS and OS (P<0.05), and T stage was only associated with OS in patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that N stage (RR=1.640, 95% CI 1.049-2.565, P=0.030) and NRS-2002 (RR=3.154, 95% CI 1.946-5.113, P<0.001) were independent prognostic factors for PFS in patients with ESCC after surgery. Additionally, pathological differentiation (RR=1.556, 95% CI 1.004-2.440, P=0.041), N stage (RR=1.624, 95% CI 1.017-2.593, P=0.042) and NRS-2002 (RR=3.906, 95% CI2.245-6.795, P<0.001) were independent prognostic factors for OS in ESCC patients following surgery. Conclusion: Preoperative nutritional risk screening NRS-2002 score is an independent prognostic factor in patients with ESCC receiving surgery and could be used as a tool for primary screening for nutritional risk.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, accounting for only around 1% of all breast cancers. Most MBCs are hormone-driven. Not only the estrogen receptor (ER), but also other steroid hormone receptors, including the androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PgR) are expressed in MBC. AR activation in breast cancer cells facilitates downstream gene expression that drives tumorigenesis in a similar manner to ER. AR-mediated signalling works paradoxically in breast cancer and prostate cancer, and cancer cells expressing the AR are endocrine-sensitive. Case presentation: We describe a case of double cancer of MBC and prostate cancer. A 69-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a lump in his left breast in the 1990s. The patient had cT3N3M0, stage IIIC breast cancer, and underwent a mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Though adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, he experienced pleural metastasis 2 months after the surgery. Two years after the recurrence during endocrine therapy with oral 5-fluorouracil, he complained of frequent urination. Radiological and histological examinations revealed that the patient had cT3N0M0, stage III primary prostate cancer with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 40.5 ng/mL. Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were not tested. He received multidisciplinary, continuous therapy for both breast and prostate cancer; however, 5 and 3 years after each diagnosis, respectively, he experienced a deep vein thrombosis in his right leg related to the endocrine therapy. Liver metastasis progressed after he stopped breast cancer therapy. However, long-term disease control had been achieved with anti-estrogen therapy for breast cancer and estrogen replacement therapy for prostate cancer. Conclusions: Several studies have shown that estrogen exposure after estrogen depletion likely causes apoptosis of ER-positive breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate that this also applies to the environment in male body. AR dominant signaling prevents breast cancer recurrence and metastasis, especially in MBC patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MIEN1 is a novel oncogene, and it involves tumor progression in various cancer types, including colon cancer. However, the definite molecular mechanisms of MIEN1 in colon cancer progression remain to be completely elucidated. In the present study, bioinformatics prediction showed that miR-136 could be an upstream regulator of MIEN1; a luciferase assay and Western blot assay revealed that miR-136 negatively regulates MIEN1 expression via directly targeting its 3′-untranslated region sequence. Moreover, a functional assay using wound healing and transwell invasion showed that overexpressed miR-136 inhibited cell migration and invasion, and overexpression of MIEN1 partly rescued the above-mentioned effects of miR-136 in colon cancer cells. Additionally, a clinical sample assay showed that miR-136 expression was generally downregulated in colon cancer tissue, which was inversely correlated with MIEN1 expression. Furthermore, we found that miR-136 suppressed the Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer. These results suggest that miR-136, as a tumor suppressor, acts in tumor metastasis by suppressing MIEN1 expression in colon cancer, providing a novel target for the treatment of colon cancer. © 2018 Ren et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate the expression of P90 Ribosomal Protein S6 kinase 4 (RSK4) in colorectal cancer cells and its biological function. Methods: We selected early SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines, using Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent carrying RSK4 gene transfected into cells to establish the colorectal cancer cell lines with high expression of RSK4. RT-PCR and western blot (WB) analysis confirmed RSK4 expression in SW480 and HCT116 cancer cell lines. We used methylthiazoltetrazolium (MTT) assay and flow cytometry to detect the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. After transfection of RSK4, the effect of RSK4 on the RNA levels associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of colorectal cancer cells was analyzed by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and the expression of EMT-related protein was detected by WB analysis. Results: After transfection of RSK4 overexpression, the MTT assay detected that RSK4 could significantly inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer cells in vitro; flow cytometry detected that S-phase cells decreased significantly, and G0/1 cells increased significantly (P < 0.05). The invasion ability of SW480 and HCT116 cells transfected with RSK4 was markedly lower than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Fluorescent quantitative PCR and WB analysis showed that the expression of EMT-associated molecular E-cadherin was remarkably increased and the expression of Snail was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Conclusion: RSK4 gene in colorectal cancer cell lines with low expression of RSK4 after transfection can inhibit the growth and invasion of tumor cells. RSK4 gene may inhibit EMT and inhibit metastasis of colorectal cancer cells, may be a potential tumor suppressor gene and inhibit tumor distant metastasis, and may provide the biological basis for new therapeutic targets. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subgroup of human breast cancer. Patients with TNBC have poor clinical outcome as they are non-responsive to current targeted therapies. There is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic targets and develop more effective treatment options for TNBC patients. Osthole, a natural product from C. monnieri, has been shown to inhibit certain cancer cells. However, the mechanisms of action as well as its effect on TNBC cells are not currently known. Methods: We investigated the effect of osthole in cultured TNBC cells as well as in a xenograft model of TNBC growth. We also used a high-throughput proteomics platform to identify the direct binding protein of osthole. Results: We found that osthole inhibited the growth of a panel of TNBC cells and induced apoptosis in both cultured cells and TNBC xenografts. We used a high-throughput proteomics platform and identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a potential binding protein of osthole. We further show that osthole suppressed STAT3 in TNBC cells to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis. Overexpressing STAT3 in TNBC reduced the effectiveness of osthole treatment. Conclusions: These results provide support for osthole as a potential new therapeutic agent for the management of TNBC. Moreover, our results indicate that STAT3 may be targeted for the development of novel anti-TNBC drugs. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Systemic inflammation has long been related with adverse survival outcomes in cancer patients, and its biomarkers, such as the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), are recognized as poor prognostic indicators. However, the role of eosinophils in this field has been largely overlooked. Here, we describe two new pre-treatment biomarkers, expressed as Eosinophil-to-Lymphocytes Ratio (ELR) and Eosinophil∗Neutrophil-to-Lymphocytes ratio (ENLR), and we analyse their impact on prognosis of endometrial cancer (EC) patients. Methods: A total of 163 consecutive patients diagnosed with EC and treated with postoperative radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy in our institution from January 2011 to December 2015 were evaluated. The cohort was divided in two groups applying the cut-off value of 0.1 and 0.5 according to ROC curve for pre-treatment ELR and ENLR, respectively. After patients' stratification according to the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO modified risk assessment, subgroup analyses were conducted. Results: Higher values of ELR and ENLR were associated with worse OS (p = 0.004 and p = 0.010, respectively). On univariate analysis, the factors associated with shorter OS were ELR ≥ 0.1 (HR = 2.9, p = 0.017), ENLR ≥ 0.5 (HR = 3.0, p = 0.015), advanced FIGO stage (HR = 3.4, p = 0.007), endometrioid histology (HR = 0.26, p = 0.003) and ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO high-risk (HR = 10.2, p = 0.023). On multivariate Cox regression, higher ELR and ENLR were independently associated with a worse outcome adjusted for the standardly applied prognostic factors. Conclusions: Increased values of ELR and ENLR portend worse OS in EC, especially in patients classified by the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO guidelines as a high-risk group. To our best knowledge, this is the first report describing eosinophils-related ratios as prognostic biomarkers in malignant tumours. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Physical activity may be difficult for survivors with poorer functioning following primary treatment. The study examined whether late symptoms of breast cancer treatment impact PA adoption (0–6 months) and maintenance (6–18 months) during a weight management intervention, and whether late symptoms influence PA when accounting for overall functioning. Methods Secondary analyses were conducted using a sample of survivors participating in a weight management intervention and who provided valid weight and accelerometer data at baseline and 6 months (N = 176). The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Checklist (BCPT) assessed late treatment-related symptoms. SF-12 Physical Component Scale (PCS) and Mental Component Scale (MCS) scores assessed functioning. Results Change in bouted moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) min/week from baseline to 6 months was not associated with BCPT scales (all p values > 0.05). When adding SF-12 scores to the model, change in bouted MVPA min/ week was significantly associated with the PCS (p = 0.045). Change in MVPA min/week from 6 to 18 months was significantly associated with cognitive symptoms (p = 0.004), but not musculoskeletal or vasomotor symptoms (p values > 0.05). When adding 6-month SF-12 scores to the model, MVPA min/week was significantly associated with PCS (p = 0.001) and MCS (p = 0.028); however, BCPT cognitive problems score became non-significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions Poorer physical functioning was associated with lower PA adoption, and poorer mental and physical functioning was associated with lower maintenance of PA, while late symptoms generally were not. Interventionists should consider level of functioning when identifying individual PA goals during weight management interventions. © The Author(s) 2017. This article is an open access publication.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The incidence and mortality of cancer metastasis is high worldwide. Despite of the chemotherapeutic agents, many cancer patients still take traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions as adjuvant treatments. However, most of these herbal formulae/products lack of evidence-based efficacy. Based on our previous investigations on anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic, anti-metastatic, bone protective and immunomodulating activities of various Chinese herbal medicines, four constituent herbs, namely Andrographis paniculata, Acanthopanax senticosus, Camellia sinensis, and Hedyotis diffusa were eventually selected to form an innovative herbal formula. Methods: The anti-tumor efficacies of the formula were evaluated in metastatic breast cancer mice model. The bone protective and immunomodulatory effects were also assessed after formula treatment. Results: Our results showed that the breast tumor weight as well as lung and liver metastasis in mice could be reduced after herbal formula treatment for 4 weeks. The breast tumor-induced osteolysis in mice was restored by herbal formula treatment, in which the bone volume in treated mice tibia was comparable to that in the non-tumor bearing normal mice. The IL-12 level was augmented and the survival of mice with metastatic breast tumors was prolonged after treatment. Furthermore, combination of herbal formula with chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin resulted in better anti-tumor efficacy and increased life span in tumor-bearing mice, when compared with doxorubicin alone treatment. Conclusions: In summary, our innovative Chinese herbal formula was demonstrated to possess anti-tumor, anti-metastatic and bone-protective activities in metastatic breast tumor-bearing mice. The preclinical data generated in this study would lead to the development of evidence-based supplement as adjuvant therapy for metastatic breast cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Metastatic cancer to bone is well-known to produce extreme pain. It has been suggested that the magnitude of this perceived pain is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. These data suggest a potential cross-talk between cancer cells and nociceptors that contribute not only to pain, but also to cancer aggressiveness although the underlying mechanisms are yet to be stablished. Methods: The in vitro dose dependent effect of neuropeptides (NPs) (substance P [SP], calcitonin gene-related peptide and neurokinin A [NKA]) and/or its combination, on the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 LUC+ were assessed by wound healing and collagen-based cell invasion assays, respectively. The effect of NPs on the expression of its receptors (SP [NK1] and neurokinin A receptors [NK2], CALCRL and RAMP1) and kininogen (high-molecular-weight kininogen) release to the cell culture supernatant of MDA-MB-231 LUC+ , were measured using western-blot analysis and an ELISA assay, respectively. Statistical significance was tested using one-way ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, or the paired t-test. Post-hoc testing was performed with correction for multiple comparisons as appropriate. Results: Our data show that NPs strongly modify the chemokinetic capabilities of a cellular line commonly used as a model of metastatic cancer to bone (MDA-MB-231 LUC+ ) and increased the expression of their receptors (NK1R, NK2R, RAMP1, and CALCRL) on these cells. Finally, we demonstrate that NPs also trigger the acute release of HMWK (Bradykinin precursor) by MDA-MB-231 LUC+ , a molecule with both tumorigenic and pro-nociceptive activity. Conclusions: Based on these observations we conclude that NPs exposure modulates this breast cancer cellular line aggressiveness by increasing its ability to migrate and invade new tissues. Furthermore, these results also support the pro nociceptive and cancer promoter role of the peripheral nervous system, during the initial stages of the disease. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Previous studies on prostate cancer modeling under hormonal therapy successfully fit clinical serum androgen data, under the assumption that the levels of intracellular and serum androgen are similar. However, such an assumption may not hold throughout the course of treatment. In this paper, we propose a model that directly accounts for serum androgen and its interaction with intracellular androgen. We establish biological links between the model and clinical data, and discuss in detail parameter ranges and the initialization of model variables. We further investigate parameter sensitivity over time, which gauges the maximum effect of varying each parameter and allows us to fix some parameters, to increase the robustness of the parameter fitting process. By relying on the characteristics of intermittent androgen suppression therapy (IAS), we employ a two-part weighted error function for fitting. We also carry out mathematical analyses to study the dynamic aspects of the system with different androgen thresholds. We find that the proposed model shows superior forecasting ability, compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of androgen on the dynamics of the androgen-dependent and -independent cancer cells, which suggests the discrete description of androgen dependency may not give a realistic characterization of the cancer population. We show that IAS has certain characteristics that need to be considered for parameter estimation. Our results demonstrate that the model and the fitting scheme are viable for similar applications of prostate cancer modeling under hormonal therapy. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Palliative care, as a relatively young field within medicine, has increasingly used original research to validate and standardize its practice. In particular, palliative care has been incorporated into oncology to better address end-of-life decisions and care. The goal of this study is to identify seminal studies in the field of palliative oncology while more broadly characterizing the trends across the literature. Methods: The publication databases Scopus and Web of Science were queried using predefined search terms to identify palliative oncology studies published between 1995 and 2016. The 100 most-cited articles from the time periods 1995-2005 and 2006-2016 were selected and analysed for publication data and study content. Results: Palliative oncology studies were found to primarily examine patients with multiple rather than single cancer types and rarely were randomized controlled trials. Early research topics of pain, symptoms, and survival studies have been replaced by the issues of access to care, healthcare utilization, and religion and spirituality. Conclusions: By identifying and analyzing notable studies in palliative oncology, we found areas of research that are commonly investigated or overlooked and identified model studies that highlight the need for additional disease-specific randomized control trials to provide high quality clinical evidence in the field. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant cancer of the liver and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has not been known to have a direct causal relationship with HCC despite independently causing inflammation of the liver. However, little is known on risk factors for HCC patients in an HIV endemic area. The objective of this study was to ascertain the risk factors of HCC and its association with HIV infection. Methods: This was an un-matched case-control study conducted between June 2015 and June 2016 in Kisumu County Referral Hospital, Kenya. The study enrolled 257 patients with HCC cases and 257 controls. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors for HIV and controlling for exploratory variables. Independent t-test was used to compare means. Exposure variable with values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: HCC cases were more likely to be above 35 years old compared to controls (88.3% vs 23.0%), [aOR =51.6, 95% CI (27.8-95.6), P < 0.001)]. HBV infected patients have higher risk of HCC (47.1% vs 30.4%), [aOR = 3.3; 95% CI (1.7-5.0), P < 0.0001)]. HIV positive patients were more likely to have HCC than HIV negative patients (33.5% vs 10.9%), [aOR =4.3, 95% CI (2.2-8.4)), P < 0.001]. Females have lower risk of HCC than males (32.7 vs 23.7) [aOR = 0.2, 95% CI (0.1-0.4), P < 0.001]. The majority of HCC patients were at the time of diagnosis at stages C (35.1%) and D (48.6%) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Clinic (BCLC) criteria. Conclusion: Liver cancer was more frequent among adults and subjects co-infected with HBV and HIV. Thus, HIV represents an additional risk factor for liver cancer in this Kenyan population. Regular health screening of HIV and HBV infected subjects may significantly improve the early diagnosis and effective therapy of liver cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for patients with malignant main stem bronchial tumors (MBTs) and to develop a nomogram for predicting prognosis in those patients using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Method: A process was used for case screening from the SEER database. The effect of prognostic factors on survival was evaluated using the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test, a competing risk model, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. A nomogram was established for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) in patients with MBTs. Results: A total of 7,418 cases were included in this study. Age, gender, pathologic grade, histologic type, tumor size, involvement of lymph nodes, tumor extension, chemotherapy, and surgery were identified as independent risk factors by univariate and multivariate analyses. A nomogram was established based on the results of the Cox model, which was validated by a C-index of 0.672 (95% CI, 0.664–0.680), and a group of calibration plots. Conclusion: Age, gender, pathologic grade, histologic type, tumor size, involvement of lymph nodes, tumor extension, chemotherapy, and surgery were independent risk factors for OS of patients with MBTs. A nomogram was formulated to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS in patients with MBTs based on individual clinical characteristics. © 2018 Ma et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The prevalence and distribution of histologically diagnosed breast disease are not well documented in low income countries, Uganda inclusive. Although the greater majority of breast lesions globally are benign, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer all over the world. We aimed at documenting the prevalence of different breast diseases histologically diagnosed at the histopathology laboratory of the Department of Pathology of the Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS Lab) over a decade (2005-2014). We also describe the demographic characteristics of the patients in Uganda diagnosed with breast disease at the MakCHS Lab during the same period. Methods: This was a 10 year retrospective study of histologically diagnosed breast disease between 2005 and 2014 inclusive at the MakCHS Lab. We extracted information from hard copies of all 2510 histopathology reports retrieved from archives of the Department of Pathology at the MakCHS Lab. 640 records that were either damaged beyond recognition of key details, were duplicated, were implausible or had no conclusive diagnosis made were excluded. Information to be analyzed was then entered into Epidata (version 3.1) on a password protected laptop. Data analysis was done using SPSS software (v16 for Windows × 64). Results: From the 1870 patients' records eventually analyzed, breast disease was most diagnosed in female patients (97.1%). The overall mean age for breast disease diagnosis was 33 years (S.D ± 16.46) and median age 26 years (IQR: 20-43). Fibroadenoma (40.1%) was the most diagnosed breast disease overall. We noticed steadily increasing frequency of diagnosis of cancerous breast diseases over the last half of the study period. Invasive ductal carcinoma was the most diagnosed breast cancer (326 cases, 55.6%). A high female to male breast cancer ratio of 48:1 was observed. The highest regional breast cancer proportion was from the Western region of the Country. Conclusions: There is need for more research into the picture of breast disease in the country, covering various demographic characteristics of the country's population for all regions and informing about its incidence rates and prevalence and also the breast cancer risk estimate for benign breast disease. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Complex interactions occur between cancer cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment. In this study, the prognostic value of the interplay between tumor–stroma ratio (TSR) and the immune status of tumors in breast cancer patients was evaluated. Methods A cohort of 574 breast cancer patients was analyzed. The percentage of tumor stroma was visually estimated on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histological tumor tissue sections. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, HLA-E, HLA-G, markers for regulatory T (Treg) cells, natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Results TSR (P <.001) and immune status of tumors (P <.001) were both statistically significant for recurrence free period (RFP) and both independent prognosticators (P <.001) in which tumors with a high stromal content behave more aggressively as well as tumors with a low immune status. Ten years RFP for patients with a stroma-low tumor and high immune status profile was 87% compared to 17% of patients with a stroma-high tumor combined with low immune status profile (P <.001). Classical HLA class I is the most prominent immune marker in the immune status profiles. Conclusions Determination of TSR is a simple, fast and cheap method. The effect on RFP of TSR when combined with immune status of tumors or expression of classical HLA class I is even stronger. Both are promising for further prediction and achievement of tailored treatment for breast cancer patients. © The Author(s) 2017. This article is an open access publication.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/aims: Ras is a control switch of ERK1/2 pathway, and hyperactivation of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling appears frequently in human cancers. However, the molecular regulation following by Ras-ERK1/2 activation is still unclear. This work aimed to reveal whether Ras-ERK1/2 promoted the development of colorectal cancer via regulating H3K9ac. Methods: A vector for expression of K-Ras mutated at G12 V and T35S was transfected into SW48 cells, and the acetylation of H3K9 was measured by Western blot analysis. MTT assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RT-qPCR were performed to detect whether H3K9ac was contributed to K-Ras-mediated cell growth and migration. Furthermore, whether HDAC2 and PCAF involved in modification of H3K9ac following Ras-ERK1/2 activation were studied. Results: K-Ras mutated at G12 V and T35S induced a significant activation of ERK1/2 signaling and a significant down-regulation of H3K9ac. Recovering H3K9 acetylation by using a mimicked H3K9ac expression vector attenuated the promoting effects of Ras-ERK1/2 on tumor cells growth and migration. Besides, H3K9ac can be deacetylated by HDAC2 and MDM2-depedent degradation of PCAF. Conclusion: H3K9ac was a specific target for Ras-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. H3K9 acetylation can be modulated by HDAC2 and MDM2-depedent degradation of PCAF. The revealed regulation provides a better understanding of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling in tumorigenesis. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive disease, and the lethality of this disease stems from early metastatic dissemination where surgical removal cannot provide a cure. Improvement of the therapeutic outcome and overall survival of PC patients requires to understand the fundamental processes that lead to metastasis such as the gain of cellular migration ability. One such family of proteins, which are essential players of cellular migration, is Semaphorin. Previously, we have identified one of the Semaphorin family member, Semaphorin-5A (SEMA5A) to be involved in organ-specific homing during PC metastasis. We have also demonstrated that SEMA5A has a constitutive expression in PC cell lines derived from metastatic sites in comparison with low endogenous expression in the primary tumor-derived cell line. In this study, we examined whether constitutive SEMA5A expression in metastatic PC cells regulates tumor growth and metastatic potential. Methods: We generated SEMA5A knockdown in T3M-4 and CD18/HPAF cells and assessed their phenotypes on in vitro motility, tumor growth, and metastatic progression. Results: In contrary to our initial expectations, orthotopic injection of SEMA5A knockdown cells into nude mice resulted in a significant increase in both tumor burden and liver metastases in comparison with the Control cells. Similarly, we observed higher in vitro migratory potential with pronounced morphological changes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a decrease in the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (E-Cad), increase in the expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin (N-Cad) and Snail and the activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway in SEMA5A knockdown cells. Furthermore, re-establishing SEMA5A expression with a knockdown resistant mouse Sema5A in SEMA5A knockdown cells resulted in a reversion to the epithelial state (mesenchymal-epithelial transition; MET), as indicated by the rescue of E-Cad expression and a decrease in N-Cad and Snail expression. Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggest that SEMA5A expression maintains epithelial phenotype in the metastatic microenvironment. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumors. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), an NAD-dependent deacetylase, is known to promote metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: In this work, we determined the role of SIRT6 in the EMT of NSCLC cells and identified the key EMT-related genes involved in the oncogenic activity of SIRT6. Results: We report that depletion of SIRT6 inhibits transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced EMT in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells, which is rescued by ectopic expression of SIRT6. Knockdown of SIRT6 leads to a reduction in Snail protein without affecting the mRNA level. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate a physical association between SIRT6 and Snail. SIRT6 deacetylates Snail and prevents its proteasomal degradation. Silencing of Snail blunts SIRT6-induced NSCLC cell migration and invasion, while overexpression of Snail restores the invasion and EMT in SIRT6-depleted NSCLC cells. SIRT6 depletion leads to an upregulation of kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and reduced Snail binding to the promoter of Klf4 in NSCLC cells. Knockdown of KLF4 rescues the invasive capacity in SIRT6-depleted NSCLC cells. Conversely, co-expression of KLF4 impairs SIRT6-induced aggressive behavior. In vivo data further demonstrate that SIRT6-induced NSCLC metastasis is antagonized by overexpression of KLF4. Conclusions: These findings provide mechanistic insights into the pro-metastatic activity of SIRT6 and highlight the role of the SIRT6/Snail/KLF4 axis in regulating EMT and invasion of NSCLC cells. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Alectinib is an approved treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Despite positive supporting clinical data, there is a lack of real-world information on the usage and patient outcomes of those treated with alectinib post-crizotinib progression. Methods: Participating oncologists (N=95) in the USA were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a retrospective patient chart review. Physicians randomly selected eligible patients (ie, patients who progressed on crizotinib as their first ALK inhibitor and were treated with alectinib as their second ALK inhibitor), collected demographics and clinical history from their medical charts, and entered the data into an online data collection form. Results: A total of N=207 patient charts were included (age: 60.1±10.4 years; 53.6% male). The patients in our sample were older (median age of 60 vs 53 years), were more likely to be current smokers (12% vs 1%), had better performance status (45% vs 33% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] of 0), and were less likely to have an adenocarcinoma histology (83% vs 96%) relative to published clinical trials. The objective response rate was higher than in clinical trials (67.1% vs 51.3%, respectively) as was the disease control rate (89.9% vs 78.8%, respectively), though it varied by race/ethnicity, ECOG, and prior treatment history. Discontinuation (0.0%) and dose reductions (3.4%) due to adverse events were uncommon in alectinib. Conclusion: Patients using alectinib post-crizotinib in clinical practice are older, more racially/ethnically and histologically diverse than patients in published trials. Real-world response rates were high and similar to those reported in clinical studies, though there is some variation by patient characteristics. Alectinib was well tolerated in clinical practice as reflected by the rates of discontinuation, dose reductions, and dose interruptions. © 2018 DiBonaventura et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest solid tumors. The rapid progression of PDAC results in an advanced stage of patients when diagnosed. However, the dynamic molecular mechanism underlying PDAC progression remains far from clear. Methods: The microarray GSE62165 containing PDAC staging samples was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal tissue and PDAC of different stages were profiled using R software, respectively. The software program Short Time-series Expression Miner was applied to cluster, compare, and visualize gene expression differences between PDAC stages. Then, function annotation and pathway enrichment of DEGs were conducted by Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Further, the Cytoscape plugin DyNetViewer was applied to construct the dynamic protein-protein interaction networks and to analyze different topological variation of nodes and clusters over time. The phosphosite markers of stage-specific protein kinases were predicted by PhosphoSitePlus database. Moreover, survival analysis of candidate genes and pathways was performed by Kaplan-Meier plotter. Finally, candidate genes were validated by immunohistochemistry in PDAC tissues. Results: Compared with normal tissues, the total DEGs number for each PDAC stage were 994 (stage I), 967 (stage IIa), 965 (stage IIb), 1027 (stage III), 925 (stage IV), respectively. The stage-course gene expression analysis showed that 30 distinct expressional models were clustered. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that the up-regulated DEGs were commonly enriched in five fundamental pathways throughout five stages, including pathways in cancer, small cell lung cancer, ECM-receptor interaction, amoebiasis, focal adhesion. Except for amoebiasis, these pathways were associated with poor PDAC overall survival. Meanwhile, LAMA3, LAMB3, LAMC2, COL4A1 and FN1 were commonly shared by these five pathways and were unfavorable factors for prognosis. Furthermore, by constructing the stage-course dynamic protein interaction network, 45 functional molecular modules and 19 nodes were identified as featured regulators for all PDAC stages, among which the collagen family and integrins were considered as two main regulators for facilitating aggressive progression. Additionally, the clinical relevance analysis suggested that the stage IV featured nodes MLF1IP and ITGB4 were significantly correlated with shorter overall survival. Moreover, 15 stage-specific protein kinases were identified from the dynamic network and CHEK1 was particularly activated at stage IV. Experimental validation showed that MLF1IP, LAMA3 and LAMB3 were progressively increased from tumor initiation to progression. Conclusions: Our study provided a view for a better understanding of the dynamic landscape of molecular interaction networks during PDAC progression and offered potential targets for therapeutic intervention. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Urine has evolved as a promising body fluids in clinical proteomics because it can be easily and noninvasively obtained and can reflect physiological and pathological status of the human body. Many efforts have been made to characterize more urinary proteins in recent years, but few have focused on the analysis throughput and detection reproducibility. Increasing the urine proteomic profiling throughput and reproducibility is urgently needed for discovering potential biomarker in large cohorts. Methods: In this study, we developed a fast and robust workflow for streamlined urinary proteome analysis. The workflow integrate highly efficient sample preparation technique and urinary specific data-independent acquisition (DIA) approach. The performance of the workflow was systematically evaluated and the workflow was subsequently applied in a proof-of-concept urine proteome study of 21 kidney cancer (KC) patients and 22 healthy controls. Results: With this workflow, the entire sample preparation process takes less than 3 h and allows multiplexing on standard centrifuges. Without pre-fractionation, our newly developed DIA method allows quantitative analysis of ~ 1000 proteins within 80 min of MS time (~ 15 samples/day). The quantitation accuracy of the whole workflow was excellent with median CV of 9.1%. The preliminary study on KC identified 125 significantly changed proteins. Conclusions: The result suggested the feasibility of applying the high throughput workflow in extensive urinary proteome profiling and clinical relevant biomarker discovery. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Tumor suppressor epigenetic silencing plays an important role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development and progression. Previously, the expression of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) has been found to be significantly inhibited in NSCLC. Our research aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms, clinical significance and epigenetic alteration of SPOP in NSCLC. Materials and methods: Bisulfite sequencing PCR and methylation-specific PCR were performed to test gene methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to detect transcription factor C/EBPα combinations and the promoter of the SPOP gene. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of C/EBPα siRNA on SPOP expression, tumor cell migration and proliferation via MTT and Transwell assays in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. The relationship between the methylation status of the SPOP gene and clinicopathologic characteristics was investigated. Results: Hypermethylation was found in the CpG island of the SPOP gene promoter in NSCLC tissues, and this methylation was found to be correlated with SPOP expression. SPOP promoter methylation was associated with the pathology grade. The transcriptional activities were significantly inhibited by the hypermethylation of specific CpG sites within the SPOP gene promoter, while 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine significantly increased SPOP gene expression. C/EBPα also played a key role in SPOP regulation. Five C/EBPα binding sites in the CpG island of the SPOP gene promoter were identified by ChIP. Inhibition of C/EBPα significantly reduced SPOP expression. SPOP mediated the C/EBPα-regulated suppression of invasion, migration and proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Conclusions: SPOP function and expression in NSCLS were regulated by DNA methylation and C/EBPα transcriptional regulation combination effects, indicating that the SPOP promoter methylation status could be utilized as an epigenetic biomarker and that the C/EBPα-SPOP signaling pathway could be a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease. The survival of older patients is generally poor. In the current study, we sought to investigate the differences in molecular gene mutations between younger and older AML patients, and to identify those newly diagnosed AML patients who are more likely to respond to standard cytarabine and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 179 patients who were newly diagnosed with non-M3 AML. A next-generation sequencing assay covering 34 genes was used to investigate recurrently mutated genes. The mutational status of fusion genes was determined by real time PCR. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 53 years (range 18-88 years). Sixty-eight patients were 60 years or older with a median age of 67 years (range 60-88 years). Eighteen patients (10.1%) carried t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) or RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene fusion, and there was a significantly higher incidence in younger patients (p = 0.019). At least one non-synonymous gene mutation was detected in 159 patients (88.8%). The median number of gene mutations was two (range 0-6). The mean number of molecular gene mutations at diagnosis was higher in older patients than younger patients (2.5 vs 1.83, p = 0.003). Older patients had significantly higher incidences of ASXL1 (22.1% vs 13.5%, p = 0.025) and TP53 mutations (13.2% vs 3.6%, p = 0.034). In total, 78 patients received DA60 (daunorubicin 60 mg/m 2 per day on days 1-3 and cytarabine 100 mg/m 2 twice per day on days 1-7) as the induction therapy, and information was available on their response to induction treatment. Patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene fusion were significantly more likely to achieve complete remission (CR) after DA60 induction therapy (p = 0.026), as were patients without the ASXL1 mutation (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Older AML patients had a lower incidence of favorable cytogenetics and higher frequencies and burdens of molecular mutations that are associated with poor prognosis compared to younger patients. Patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene fusion or without the ASXL1 gene mutation had a better chance of achieving CR when treated with cytarabine and daunorubicin induction chemotherapy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: Long-term statin therapy has been shown to protect against several cancers, including esophageal cancer (EC). While the mechanisms underlying this effect are not clear. We investigated the effect of hydrophobic simvastatin and hydrophilic pravastatin on the proliferation of EC cells and sought to explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Esophageal adenocarcinoma OE-19 cells and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma Eca-109 cells were treated with different concentrations of simvastatin or pravastatin for 24 h and 48 h. Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay. mRNA and protein expression of COX-2 were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively; The expression of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) was measured by ELISA. Results: Simvastatin, but not pravastatin, significantly inhibited the proliferation of OE-19 and Eca-109 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, accompanying with the increasing of the MDA level. Moreover, simvastatin suppressed the expression of COX-2 and PGE 2 in both OE-19 and Eca-109 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Lipophilic simvastatin, but not hydrophilic pravastatin, had significant inhibitory effects on the proliferation of Eca-109 and OE-19 cells. The reduction of COX-2 and PGE 2 by simvastatin suggested that the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on the proliferation of EC cells may be independent of its lipid-lowering effect. Simvastatin may be a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of EC. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy in China, and China’s annual number of new cases accounts for about 45% of the world total. This research was aimed to study the expression of TBX3 protein in HCC and exploring its clinical significance. Material/Methods: We collected tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumoral tissues of 174 patients with HCC undergoing surgical resection. The expression of TBX3 protein in different tissues and cell lines in vitro (LO2, HHL-5, MHC97-L, MHC97-H) was detected by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting, and the relationship between TBX3 expression and clinical data of patients with HCC was analyzed. Results: The expression of TBX3 protein in HCC was significantly correlated with histological grade, tumor size, cancer cell metastasis, hepatitis B surface antigen, and the expression of Ki-67 in tumor tissues (P<0.05), and it was positively correlated with serum AFP level (r=0.766, P<0.05). The expression of TBX3 increased with increased histological grade in HCC (P<0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that the expression of TBX3 protein in HCC was an independent risk factor for prognosis (OR=0.524, 95% CI=0.283-0.964). The 5-year survival rate of patients with HCC that highly expressed TBX3 protein was 20.83%, which was significantly lower than the 40.20% rate in patients with low expression (P<0.05). Conclusions: The expression of TBX3 in HCC patients undergoing surgical resection is high, and its expression increases with the degree of tumor differentiation. It is related to the metastasis of tumor cells and is positively correlated with the serum level of AFP and may affect the survival time of HCC patients undergoing surgical resection. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "The advance of high-throughput RNA-Sequencing techniques enables researchers to analyze the complete gene activity in particular cells. From the insights of such analyses, researchers can identify disease-specific expression profiles, thus understand complex diseases like cancer, and eventually develop effective measures for diagnosis and treatment. The high dimensionality of gene expression data poses challenges to its computational analysis, which is addressed with measures of gene selection. Traditional gene selection approaches base their findings on statistical analyses of the actual expression levels, which implies several drawbacks when it comes to accurately identifying the underlying biological processes. In turn, integrative approaches include curated information on biological processes from external knowledge bases during gene selection, which promises to lead to better interpretability and improved predictive performance. Our work compares the performance of traditional and integrative gene selection approaches. Moreover, we propose a straightforward approach to integrate external knowledge with traditional gene selection approaches. We introduce a framework enabling the automatic external knowledge integration, gene selection, and evaluation. Evaluation results prove our framework to be a useful tool for evaluation and show that integration of external knowledge improves overall analysis results.",

    "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors which activate the host's immune system to fight cancer have brought dramatic improvements to the overall survival of a growing number of deadly malignancies. Their use comes at the expense of often serious immune-related adverse events which consist of an off-target attack of the immune system on potentially any of the human body's healthy organs. For lack of better-validated evidence, and regardless of the organ affected, clinicians often use the same immunosuppressive regimens consisting of high dose corticosteroids followed by the introduction of biologic agents such as the tumor-necrosis alpha inhibitor infliximab for corticosteroid-refractory toxicities. The article by Johnson et al. is timely in providing a more personalized approach for the management of immune-related toxicities affecting the lower digestive tract with many positive clinical outcomes associated with the upfront use of infliximab in association with corticosteroids. This commentary will provide a narrative summary of their findings in light of the current clinical knowledge relevant to the understanding of immune-related enterocolitis. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: In 2006, 4 years of planning was started by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH), to implement the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination programme. An inter-agency and multi-sectoral collaborations were developed for Malaysia's HPV school-based immunisation programme. It was approved for nationwide school base implementation for 13-year-old girls or first year secondary students in 2010. This paper examines how the various strategies used in the implementation over the last 7 years (2010-2016) that unique to Malaysia were successful in achieving optimal coverage of the target population. Methods: Free vaccination was offered to school girls in secondary school (year seven) in Malaysia, which is usually at the age of 13 in the index year. All recipients of the HPV vaccine were identified through school enrolments obtained from education departments from each district in Malaysia. A total of 242,638 girls aged between 12 to 13 years studying in year seven were approached during the launch of the program in 2010. Approximately 230,000 girls in secondary schools were offered HPV vaccine per year by 646 school health teams throughout the country from 2010 to 2016. Results: Parental consent for their daughters to receive HPV vaccination at school was very high at 96-98% per year of the programme. Of those who provided consent, over 99% received the first dose each year and 98-99% completed the course per year. Estimated population coverage for the full vaccine course, considering also those not in school, is estimated at 83 to 91% per year. Rates of adverse events reports following HPV vaccination were low at around 2 per 100,000 and the majority was injection site reactions. Conclusion: A multisectoral and integrated collaborative structure and process ensured that the Malaysia school-based HPV immunisation programme was successful and sustained through the programme design, planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. This is a critical factor contributing to the success and sustainability of the school-based HPV immunisation programme with very high coverage. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Neurologic toxicities with immune therapy are rare, but can cause devastating and often permanent injury when they occur. Although there is increasing interest in the potential synergism between immune therapy and radiation, it is possible that such combinations may lead to a greater number or increased severity of immune-related adverse events. We present here a case of extensive and progressive transverse myelitis following combined therapy, which did not improve until treatment with infliximab. This case highlights the unmet need for treatment of adverse events that are refractory to consensus recommendations, and may ultimately require further study and incorporation into future published guidelines. Case presentation: We report a case of a 68-year-old with metastatic melanoma, who developed transverse myelitis in the setting of immune checkpoint blockade and spinal irradiation for vertebral metastases. Despite management according to published consensus guidelines: cessation of immune therapy, high-dose steroids, and plasmapheresis, he continued to deteriorate neurologically, and imaging revealed a progressive and ascending transverse myelitis. The patient was then treated with infliximab, and demonstrated dramatic imaging and modest clinical improvement following the first treatment cycle. Conclusions: This is the first report describing the successful use of infliximab in immune therapy and radiation-related transverse myelitis that was not responding to recommended therapy. Evaluation of additional treatment options such as infliximab for high-grade immune-related neurologic toxicities is warranted, and may be needed earlier in the disease process to prevent significant morbidity. The adverse effects of immune therapy when used in combination with radiation also require further investigation. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cisplatin has been widely used for the treatment of cancer and its antitumour activity is attributed to its capacity to form DNA adducts, predominantly at guanine residues, which impede cellular processes such as DNA replication and transcription. However, there are associated toxicity and drug resistance issues which plague its use. This has prompted the development and screening of a range of chemotherapeutic drug analogues towards improved efficacy. The biological properties of three novel platinum-based compounds consisting of varying cis-configured ligand groups, as well as a commercially supplied compound, were characterised in this study to determine their potential as anticancer agents. Methods: The linear amplification reaction was employed, in conjunction with capillary electrophoresis, to quantify the sequence specificity of DNA adducts induced by these compounds using a DNA template containing telomeric repeat sequences. Additionally, the DNA interstrand cross-linking and unwinding efficiency of these compounds were assessed through the application of denaturing and native agarose gel electrophoresis techniques, respectively. Their cytotoxicity was determined in HeLa cells using a colorimetric cell viability assay. Results: All three novel platinum-based compounds were found to induce DNA adduct formation at the tandem telomeric repeat sequences. The sequence specificity profile at these sites was characterised and these were distinct from that of cisplatin. Two of these compounds with the enantiomeric 1,2-diaminocyclopentane ligand (SS and RR-DACP) were found to induce a greater degree of DNA unwinding than cisplatin, but exhibited marginally lower DNA cross-linking efficiencies. Furthermore, the RR-isomer was more cytotoxic in HeLa cells than cisplatin. Conclusions: The biological characteristics of these compounds were assessed relative to cisplatin, and a variation in the sequence specificity and a greater capacity to induce DNA unwinding was observed. These compounds warrant further investigations towards developing more efficient chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Right-sided colon cancer (RCC) has worse prognosis compared to left-sided colon cancer (LCC) and rectal cancer. The reason for this difference in outcomes is not well understood. We performed comparative somatic and proteomic analyses of RCC, LCC and rectal cancers to understand the unique molecular features of each tumor sub-types. Utilizing a novel in silico clonal evolution algorithm, we identified common tumor-initiating events involving APC, KRAS and TP53 genes in RCC, LCC and rectal cancers. However, the individual role-played by each event, their order in tumor development and selection of downstream somatic alterations were distinct in all three anatomical locations. Some similarities were noted between LCC and rectal cancer. Hotspot mutation analysis identified a nonsense mutation, APC R1450∗specific to RCC. In addition, we discovered new significantly mutated genes at each tumor location, Further in silico proteomic analysis, developed by our group, found distinct central or hub proteins with unique interactomes among each location. Our study revealed significant differences between RCC, LCC and rectal cancers not only at somatic but also at proteomic level that may have therapeutic relevance in these highly complex and heterogeneous tumors. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In view of the high incidence of gastric cancer and the functions of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), our study aimed to investigate the functionality of HIF-1α in gastric cancer, and to explore the diagnostic and prognostic values of HIF-1α for this disease. Expression of HIF-1α in tumor tissues and adjacent healthy tissues as well as serum collected from both gastric cancer patients and normal healthy controls was detected by qRT-PCR. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. HIF-1α siRNA silencing cell lines were established. Effects of HIF-1α siRNA silencing as well as PI3K activator sc3036 on proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells were detected by Cell counting kit (CCK-8) assay, and Transwell migration and invasion assay. Effects of HIF-1α siRNA silencing on AKT and VEGF were detected by Western blot. Expression of HIF-1α was significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues than in adjacent healthy tissues in most gastric cancer patients. Serum levels of HIF-1α were also higher in gastric cancer patients than in normal healthy people. Serum HIF-1α showed promising diagnostic and prognostic values for gastric cancer. HIF-1α siRNA silencing inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells, while PI3K activator sc3036 treatment reduced those inhibitory effects. Down-regulation of HIF-1α can inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer possibly by inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway and VEGF expression. © 2018 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Background: The relationship between platelet counts and pancreatic cancer as a prognostic factor has been reported in many studies. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of platelet counts in predicting the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for eligible studies up to May 2017. Information about the characteristics of the study and relevant outcomes was extracted. A meta-analysis was performed to analyze the prognostic value of platelet counts using the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 1,756 patients in 13 retrospective studies were included. The pooled HR of 1.51 (95% CI: 1.20–1.90, P<0.001) showed that patients with elevated platelet counts were expected to have poor overall survival after treatment. Subgroup analysis showed that prognostic value of platelet levels was stronger in patients who received surgical resection (HR =1.60, 95% CI: 1.09–2.34, P=0.02), followed by patients who received palliative therapy (HR =1.46, 95% CI: 1.03–2.06, P=0.03). Conclusion: Platelet counts could be a useful prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer. Patients with high platelet counts are expected to have poor survival. © 2018 Chen et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objectives: In endocrine-sensitive, HER-2 negative, node negative breast cancer, the presence of a low genomic risk allows treatment with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, obtaining excellent survival rates. The justification for this study is to show that excellent survival rates are also obtained by treating with adjuvant hormone therapy alone, based on clinical risk assessment. Patients and methods: A descriptive, observational and retrospective study was performed between 2006 and 2016 with endocrine-sensitive, HER-2 negative, node negative breast cancer, greater than 1 cm or between 0.6 and 1 cm with unfavourable features. Retrospective review of health records. Mortality data of the National Registry of Deaths. Results: A total of 203 patients were evaluable for survival. One hundred and twenty-three (60.50%) were treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, 77 (37.90%) with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, one (0.50%) with chemotherapy alone and 2 (1%) were not treated. The overall survival rate at 5 years was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94-100). Distant recurrence-free interval was 94% (95% CI 90-98). In the subgroup of patients treated with endocrine therapy alone, overall survival and distant recurrence-free interval rates at 5 years were 98% (95% CI 95-100) and 97% (95% CI 93-100), respectively. Conclusions: Patients with endocrine-sensitive, HER-2-negative, node negative breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy alone according to their clinical risk have similar survival outcomes as those treated with endocrine therapy according to their genomic risk. © 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer and a leading cause of death in women. Materials and methods: An experimental model of breast cancer was induced in female albino rats using single intragastric dose of 7, 12 dimethylbenz (α) anthracene (DMBA) in sesame oil (50 mg/kg b.wt). Four months after DMBA administration, incidence of breast cancer was confirmed by measuring cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) serum levels. Taraxacum officinale ssp. officinale root extract (TOE) was administered in a dose of 500 mg/kg by oral gavage for 4 weeks after breast cancer incidence. Level of CA15-3 as one of the best known breast tumor markers was elevated in all positive breast cancer rats. The genetic effects of TOE on Pdk1-Akt1-Pik3r1-Map3k1-Erbb2-PIk3ca using semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis were evaluated. In parallel, histopathological changes and immunohistochemical expression of Bcl2 in mammary gland tissues were examined. Results: Level of CA15-3 was normalized in DMBA group administered TOE for 4 weeks. Administration of DMBA increased expression of Pdk1, Akt1, Pik3r1, Map3k1, Erbb2 and PIk3ca. Treatment with TOE normalized the up-regulated mRNA for all examined genes except Pik3ra that was up-regulated. Mammary gland tissues of DMBA group showed excessive proliferation of lining epithelium of acini and ductules with hyperchromatic nuclei with excessive immunostaining of Bcl2 in the proliferated epithelium that was ameliorated by TOE administration. In conclusion, TOE regulated PI3K and Akt pathways involved in suppression of breast cancer growth and proliferation. TOE is effective as anticancer herbal agent. © 2018 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Background: The majority of cancer-related deaths are due to lung cancer, and there is a need for reliable diagnostic biomarkers to predict stages in non-small cell lung cancer cases. Recently, microRNAs were found to have potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung cancer. However, some of the microRNA's functions are unknown, and their roles in cancer stage progression have been mostly undiscovered in this clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. As evidence suggests that microRNA dysregulations are implicated in many diseases, it is essential to consider the changes in microRNA-target regulation across different lung cancer subtypes. Results: We proposed a pipeline to identify microRNA synergistic modules with similar dysregulation patterns across multiple subtypes by constructing the MicroRNA Dysregulational Synergistic Network. From the network, we extracted microRNA modules and incorporated them as prior knowledge to the Sparse Group Lasso classifier. This leads to a more relevant selection of microRNA biomarkers, thereby improving the cancer stage classification accuracy. We applied our method to the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma and the Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma datasets. In cross-validation tests, the area under ROC curve rate for the cancer stages prediction has increased considerably when incorporating the learned microRNA dysregulation modules. The extracted modules from multiple independent subtypes differential analyses were found to have high agreement with microRNA family annotations, and they can also be used to identify mutual biomarkers between different subtypes. Among the top-ranked candidate microRNAs selected by the model, 87% were reported to be related to Lung Adenocarcinoma. The overall result demonstrates that clustering microRNAs from the dysregulation pattern between microRNAs and their targets leads to biomarkers with high precision and recall rate to known differentially expressed disease-associated microRNAs. Conclusions: The results indicated that our method improves microRNA biomarker selection by detecting similar microRNA dysregulational synergistic patterns across the multiple subtypes. Since microRNA-target dysregulations are implicated in many cancers, we believe this tool can have broad applications for discovery of novel microRNA biomarkers in heterogeneous cancer diseases. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Quercetin is proven to have anticancer effects for many cancers. However, the role of tumor suppressor p53 on quercetin’s radiosensitization and regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in this process remains obscure. Here, quercetin exposure resulted in ER stress, prolonged DNA repair, and the expression of p53 protein; phosphorylation on serine 15 and 20 increased in combination with X-irradiation. Quercetin pretreatment could potentiate radiation-induced cell death. The combination of irradiation and quercetin treatment aggravated DNA damages and caused typical apoptotic cell death; as well the expression of Bax and p21 elevated and the expression of Bcl-2 decreased. Knocking down of p53 could reverse all the above effects under quercetin in combination with radiation. In addition, quercetin-induced radiosensitization was through stimulation of ATM phosphorylation. In human ovarian cancer xenograft model, combined treatment of quercetin and radiation significantly restrained the growth of tumors, accompanied with the activation of p53, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, and γ-H2AX. Overall, these results indicated that quercetin acted as a promising radiosensitizer through p53-dependent ER stress signals. © 2018 Gong et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background: As protein is the basic unit of cell function and biological pathway, shotgun proteomics, the large-scale analysis of proteins, is contributing greatly to our understanding of disease mechanisms. Proteomics study could detect the changes of both protein expression and modification. With the releases of large-scale cancer proteome studies, how to integrate acquired proteomic and phosphoproteomic data in more comprehensive pathway analysis becomes implemented, but remains challenging. Integrative pathway analysis at proteome level provides a systematic insight into the signaling network adaptations in the development of cancer. Results: Here we integrated proteomic and phosphoproteomic data to perform pathway prioritization in breast cancer. We manually collected and curated breast cancer well-known related pathways from the literature as target pathways (TPs) or positive control in method evaluation. Three different strategies including Hypergeometric test based over-representation analysis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test based gene set analysis and topology-based pathway analysis, were applied and evaluated in integrating protein expression and phosphorylation. In comparison, we also assessed the ranking performance of the strategy using information of protein expression or protein phosphorylation individually. Target pathways were ranked more top with the data integration than using the information from proteomic or phosphoproteomic data individually. In the comparisons of pathway analysis strategies, topology-based method outperformed than the others. The subtypes of breast cancer, which consist of Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal and HER2-enriched, vary greatly in prognosis and require distinct treatment. Therefore we applied topology-based pathway analysis with integrating protein expression and phosphorylation profiles on four subtypes of breast cancer. The results showed that TPs were enriched in all subtypes but their ranks were significantly different among the subtypes. For instance, p53 pathway ranked top in the Basal-like breast cancer subtype, but not in HER2-enriched type. The rank of Focal adhesion pathway was more top in HER2- subtypes than in HER2+ subtypes. The results were consistent with some previous researches. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the network topology-based method is more powerful by integrating proteomic and phosphoproteomic in pathway analysis of proteomics study. This integrative strategy can also be used to rank the specific pathways for the disease subtypes. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Current multi-petaflop supercomputers are powerful systems, but present challenges when faced with problems requiring large machine learning workflows. Complex algorithms running at system scale, often with different patterns that require disparate software packages and complex data flows cause difficulties in assembling and managing large experiments on these machines. Results: This paper presents a workflow system that makes progress on scaling machine learning ensembles, specifically in this first release, ensembles of deep neural networks that address problems in cancer research across the atomistic, molecular and population scales. The initial release of the application framework that we call CANDLE/Supervisor addresses the problem of hyper-parameter exploration of deep neural networks. Conclusions: Initial results demonstrating CANDLE on DOE systems at ORNL, ANL and NERSC (Titan, Theta and Cori, respectively) demonstrate both scaling and multi-platform execution. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: It may be possible to discover new diagnostic or therapeutic peptides or proteins from blood plasma by using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to identify, quantify and compare the peptides cleaved ex vivo from different clinical populations. The endogenous tryptic peptides of ovarian cancer plasma were compared to breast cancer and female cancer normal controls, other diseases with their matched or normal controls, plus ice cold plasma to control for pre-analytical variation. Methods: The endogenous tryptic peptides or tryptic phospho peptides (i.e. without exogenous digestion) were analyzed from 200 μl of EDTA plasma. The plasma peptides were extracted by a step gradient of organic/water with differential centrifugation, dried, and collected over C18 for analytical HPLC nano electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) with a linear quadrupole ion trap. The endogenous peptides of ovarian cancer were compared to multiple disease and normal samples from different institutions alongside ice cold controls. Peptides were randomly and independently sampled by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Precursor ions from peptides &gt; E4 counts were identified by the SEQUEST and X!TANDEM algorithms, filtered in SQL Server, before testing of frequency counts by Chi Square (χ 2 ), for analysis with the STRING algorithm, and comparison of precursor intensity by ANOVA in the R statistical system with the Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test. Results: Peptides and/or phosphopeptides of common plasma proteins such as HPR, HP, HPX, and SERPINA1 showed increased observation frequency and/or precursor intensity in ovarian cancer. Many cellular proteins showed large changes in frequency by Chi Square (χ 2 &gt; 60, p &lt; 0.0001) in the ovarian cancer samples such as ZNF91, ZNF254, F13A1, LOC102723511, ZNF253, QSER1, P4HA1, GPC6, LMNB2, PYGB, NBR1, CCNI2, LOC101930455, TRPM5, IGSF1, ITGB1, CHD6, SIRT1, NEFM, SKOR2, SUPT20HL1, PLCE1, CCDC148, CPSF3, MORN3, NMI, XTP11, LOC101927572, SMC5, SEMA6B, LOXL3, SEZ6L2, and DHCR24. The protein gene symbols with large Chi Square values were significantly enriched in proteins that showed a complex set of previously established functional and structural relationships by STRING analysis. Analysis of the frequently observed proteins by ANOVA confirmed increases in mean precursor intensity in ZFN91, TRPM5, SIRT1, CHD6, RIMS1, LOC101930455 (XP-005275896), CCDC37 and GIMAP4 between ovarian cancer versus normal female and other diseases or controls by the Tukey-Kramer HSD test. Conclusion: Here we show that separation of endogenous peptides with a step gradient of organic/water and differential centrifugation followed by random and independent sampling by LC-ESI-MS/MS with analysis of peptide frequency and intensity by SQL Server and R revealed significant difference in the ex vivo cleavage of peptides between ovarian cancer and other clinical treatments. There was striking agreement between the proteins discovered from cancer plasma versus previous biomarkers discovered in tumors by genetic or biochemical methods.

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer is a complex, multiscale dynamical system, with interactions between tumor cells and non-cancerous host systems. Therapies act on this combined cancer-host system, sometimes with unexpected results. Systematic investigation of mechanistic computational models can augment traditional laboratory and clinical studies, helping identify the factors driving a treatment's success or failure. However, given the uncertainties regarding the underlying biology, these multiscale computational models can take many potential forms, in addition to encompassing high-dimensional parameter spaces. Therefore, the exploration of these models is computationally challenging. We propose that integrating two existing technologies-one to aid the construction of multiscale agent-based models, the other developed to enhance model exploration and optimization-can provide a computational means for high-throughput hypothesis testing, and eventually, optimization. Results: In this paper, we introduce a high throughput computing (HTC) framework that integrates a mechanistic 3-D multicellular simulator (PhysiCell) with an extreme-scale model exploration platform (EMEWS) to investigate high-dimensional parameter spaces. We show early results in applying PhysiCell-EMEWS to 3-D cancer immunotherapy and show insights on therapeutic failure. We describe a generalized PhysiCell-EMEWS workflow for high-throughput cancer hypothesis testing, where hundreds or thousands of mechanistic simulations are compared against data-driven error metrics to perform hypothesis optimization. Conclusions: While key notational and computational challenges remain, mechanistic agent-based models and high-throughput model exploration environments can be combined to systematically and rapidly explore key problems in cancer. These high-throughput computational experiments can improve our understanding of the underlying biology, drive future experiments, and ultimately inform clinical practice. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies point to the evolution of drug resistance in lung cancer as being centered, at least in part, on the upregulation of various genes involved in controlling efflux or drug inactivation. Among the most important of these genes is Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor (NRF2), considered the master regulator of 100–200 target genes involved in cellular responses to oxidative and/or electrophilic stress. With increased focus on the development of combinatorial approaches for cancer treatment, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to disable the NRF2 gene in lung cancer cells by disrupting the NRF2 nuclear export signal (NES) domain; phenotypically, the protein is largely blocked from transiting into the nucleus after translation. In tissue culture, cells with this gene knockout were found to have a reduced proliferation phenotype and are more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin and carboplatin. These observations were confirmed in xenograft mouse models wherein the homozygous knockout cells proliferate at a slower rate than the wild-type cells, even in the absence of drug treatment. Tumor growth was arrested for a period of 16 days, with a dramatic decrease in tumor volume being observed in samples receiving the combined action of CRISPR-directed gene editing and chemotherapy. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticle-mediated photothermal therapy has been widely studied for cancer treatment. It is important to disclose how photothermally ablated tumor cells trigger immune responses. In this study, bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated gold nanorods (BSA-coated AuNRs) were prepared and used for photothermal ablation of breast tumor cells. The BSA-coated AuNRs showed high photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal ablation effect towards tumor cells. The ablated tumor cells were co-cultured with immature dendritic cells (DCs) through a direct cell contacting model and diffusion model to confirm the stimulatory effects of cell-cell interaction and soluble factors released from ablated tumor cells. The results indicated that photothermally ablated tumor cells induced immune-stimulatory responses of DCs through both cell-cell interaction and soluble factors. The results should be useful for synergistic photothermal-immunotherapy of primary and metastatic cancer. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides are a promising resource for developing novel antibiotic and even anticancer drugs. Here, a 28-mer polypeptide, Ranatuerin-2PLx (R2PLx), was identified from lyophilised skin secretions. The chemically synthetic replicates exhibited moderate and broadspectrum antimicrobial effect against various microorganisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, minimal inhibitory concentration = 256 µM). In addition, R2PLx was found to inhibit the proliferation of several tumour cells, especially showing more potent effect on prostate cancer cell, PC-3. The early cell apoptosis was observed in 6 h by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining, as well as the activation of Caspase-3 at 5 µM peptide concentration. R2PLx may therefore be promising for developing new therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Moreover, the artificial deficiency of conserved rana-box loop or net positive charge in C-terminal domain notably reduced the biological activities of the truncated and substituted isoforms, respectively, suggesting for maintaining their biological potency of ranatuerin family requires both cysteine-bridged segment and cationincity within the loop domain in C-terminus. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Vibrational spectroscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) have huge potential for the analysis of biological specimens. The techniques allow the user to gain label-free, non-destructive biochemical information about a given sample. Previous studies using vibrational spectroscopy with the specific application of diagnosing colorectal diseases such as cancer have mainly focused on in vivo or in vitro studies of tissue specimens using microscopy or probe based techniques. There have been few studies of vibrational spectroscopic techniques based on the analysis of blood serum for the advancement of colorectal cancer diagnostics. With growing interest in the field of liquid biopsies, this study presents the development of a high-throughput (HT) serum Raman spectroscopy platform and methodology and compares dry and liquid data acquisition of serum samples. This work considers factors contributing to translatability of the methodologies such as HT design, inter-user variability and sample handling effects on diagnostic capability. The HT Raman methods were tested on a pilot dataset of serum from 30 cancer patients and 30 matched control patients using statistical analysis via cross-validated PLS-DA with a maximum achieved a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 83% for detecting colorectal cancer. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the intraoperative and short-term postoperative outcomes of a novel robotic intracorporeal π-shaped esophagojejunostomy (EJS) after D2 total gastrectomy (TG) using the Da Vinci robotic surgical system for intracorporeal anastomosis after TG. Background: Intracorporeal π-shaped EJS, using a linear stapler, was recently reported for laparoscopic total gastrectomy in patients with gastric cancer. However, robotic intracorporeal π-shaped EJS using a linear stapler has not been reported. This report aimed to describe the use of a novel technique for π-shaped EJS using the Da Vinci robotic system. Methods: Robotic intracorporeal π-shaped esophagojejunostomy after total gastrectomy was performed in 11 consecutive patients diagnosed with early gastric cancer, and their perioperative outcomes were analyzed. Results: All the operations were successful without conversion to open or laparoscopic surgery and postoperative complications. The total number of patients was 11 (7 males and 4 females). The mean age of the patients was 63.36 ± 10.56 years old. Seven patients were diagnosed with cardia cancer, 3 patients were diagnosed with gastric body cancer, and 1 patient was diagnosed with gastric antrum cancer. The patients' mean proximal resection margin was 3.18 ± 1.17 cm, the distal resection margin was 6.18 ± 1.40 cm, the mean length of the incision was 4.55 ± 0.69 cm, the mean operative time was 287.27 ± 30.69 min, the mean day of first flatus was 3.27 ± 0.79 days, the mean day of the start of diet was 2.91 ± 0.94 days, the mean postoperative hospital stay was 11.45 ± 5.13 days, and the mean operative blood loss was 47.27 ± 31.33 ml. No complications were observed during anastomosis, and the median anastomosis time was 19.5 min. The mean number of lymph node dissections was 17.91 ± 4.59, the mean number of positive lymph nodes was 0.45 ± 0.69, all patients were diagnosed with stage I-II gastric cancer, and the mean maximum diameter of the tumor was 2.67 ± 1.30 cm. All the patients had a smooth hospital discharge. Conclusion: A novel robotic gastrectomy with intracorporeal π-shaped EJS for esophagojejunal anastomosis described and shows acceptable resulted. This technique has the potential to offer better short-term surgical outcomes and overcomes the drawbacks of laparoscopy with a decreased risk of complications during and after surgery. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Molecularly targeted therapies aim to obstruct cell autonomous programs required for tumor growth. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors act in combination to suppress the proliferation of KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells while simultaneously provoking a natural killer (NK) cell surveillance program leading to tumor cell death. The drug combination, but neither agent alone, promotes retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated cellular senescence and activation of the immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP components tumor necrosis factor–a and intercellular adhesion molecule–1 are required for NK cell surveillance of drug-treated tumor cells, which contributes to tumor regressions and prolonged survival in a KRAS-mutant lung cancer mouse model. Therefore, molecularly targeted agents capable of inducing senescence can produce tumor control through non–cell autonomous mechanisms involving NK cell surveillance. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Thyroid cancer is the most commonly reported endocrine malignancy, and its increased incidence has been the highest in all human tumors in recent decades. To investigate the mechanism of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) occurrence and progression, we performed RNA sequencing and found an upregulated gene, LAMB3. However, the biological function of LAMB3 is still not clear. Materials and methods: We analyzed LAMB3 expression using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and hypothesized LAMB3 to be a gene associated with PTC. To test this hypothesis, we collected 89 pairs of thyroid nodules and adjacent normal thyroid tissues (56 pairs of PTCs, 33 pairs of benign thyroid nodules). Afterward, we performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to investigate LAMB3 expression in thyroid nodule patients, and then analyzed clinicopathologic features. We performed proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion assays to determine the function of LAMB3 in PTC. Results: We demonstrated that LAMB3 plays oncogenic roles in PTC. The relative expression of LAMB3 is significantly upregulated in PTC compared with matched thyroid normal tissues in validated cohort and TCGA cohort (P<0.001). We also checked area under the curve (AUC of receiver operator characteristic [ROC]) of 97.3% for validated cohort and 90.1% for TCGA cohort to differentiate PTC tumors from normal tissues. In clinicopathologic feature analysis, we found that upregulated LAMB3 is closely related to lymph node metastasis (P=0.018). Furthermore, knockdown of LAMB3 inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasive capacity of PTC. Conclusion: This study indicated that LAMB3 is a gene associated with PTC. © 2018 Wang et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Histopathology images of tumor biopsies present unique challenges for applying machine learning to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The pathology slides are high resolution, often exceeding 1GB, have non-uniform dimensions, and often contain multiple tissue slices of varying sizes surrounded by large empty regions. The locations of abnormal or cancerous cells, which may constitute a small portion of any given tissue sample, are not annotated. Cancer image datasets are also extremely imbalanced, with most slides being associated with relatively common cancers. Since deep representations trained on natural photographs are unlikely to be optimal for classifying pathology slide images, which have different spectral ranges and spatial structure, we here describe an approach for learning features and inferring representations of cancer pathology slides based on sparse coding. Results: We show that conventional transfer learning using a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture pre-trained on ImageNet (RESNET) and fine tuned for a binary tumor/no-tumor classification task achieved between 85% and 86% accuracy. However, when all layers up to the last convolutional layer in RESNET are replaced with a single feature map inferred via a sparse coding using a dictionary optimized for sparse reconstruction of unlabeled pathology slides, classification performance improves to over 93%, corresponding to a 54% error reduction. Conclusions: We conclude that a feature dictionary optimized for biomedical imagery may in general support better classification performance than does conventional transfer learning using a dictionary pre-trained on natural images. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Although metastatic cancer is a major cause of death for cancer patients, no efficacious treatment for metastasis is available. We previously showed that the growth of a primary tumor could be inhibited by the administration of an anti-angiogenic small interfering RNA (siRNA) that is encapsulated in an RGD peptide-modified lipid nanoparticle (RGD-LNP). We herein report on the delivery of siRNA by an RGD-LNP to the vasculature is also effective for treating metastatic tumors. We compared the RGD-LNP with the polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated LNP (PEG-LNP) in terms of accumulation in a lung-metastasized model. Despite malformed structure of vasculature in the metastasized lung, the accumulation of the PEG-LNP in the metastasized lung was lower than that for the RGD-LNP, which suggests that the delivery strategy based on vascular permeability is not completely effective for targeting metastasis tumors. The systemic injection of the RGD-LNP induced a significant silencing in the metastasized vasculature, but not in the normal lung. In addition, the continuous injection of the RGD-LNP encapsulating siRNA against a delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) drastically prolonged the overall survival of metastasized model mice. Accordingly, our current findings suggest that vasculature targeting would be more effective than enhanced permeability and retention effect-based therapy for the treatment of metastatic cancer. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "The development of gastric cancer is frequently related to the overexpression of wild-type p21 proteins, but it is rarely related to mutated Ras proteins. We previously constructed a broad-spectrum anti-p21-Ras single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv), which was carried by the oncolytic adenovirus KGHV500. Here we explored the antitumor effects of this recombinant oncolytic adenovirus carried by cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells on human gastric SGC7901 cells that overexpress wild-type Ras. The MTT assay, scratch test, Transwell assay, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were performed in vitro to investigate the proliferation, migration, invasiveness, and cell apoptosis rate, respectively, of the human gastric cell line SGC7901 treated with KGHV500 adenovirus. Then, the tumor-targeting ability and systemic safety of KGHV500 adenovirus delivered by CIK cells were explored in vivo. We found that KGHV500 adenovirus could significantly inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasiveness and promote cell apoptosis in SGC7901 cells in vitro. In vivo studies showed that CIK cells could successfully deliver KGHV500 adenovirus to the tumor site; the two vectors synergistically killed tumor cells, and the treatment was relatively safe for normal tissues. In conclusion, this therapeutic strategy of recombinant adenovirus KGHV500 delivered by CIK cells offers a positive prospect for the targeted therapy of Ras-related cancers. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "AIM To establish a permanent piwi like RNA-mediated gene silencing 1 (PIWIL1) gene knockout in AGP01 gastric cancer cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 system and analyze phenotypic modifications as well as gene expression alterations. METHODS CRISPR-Cas9 system used was purchased from Dharmacon GE Life Sciences (Lafayette, CO, United States) and permanent knockout was performed according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Wound-healing assay was performed to investigate the effect of PIWIL1 knockout on migration capability of cells and Boyden chamber invasion assay was performed to investigate the effect on invasion capability. For the gene expression analysis, a one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States) was used according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. RESULTS PIWIL1 gene knockout caused a significant decrease in AGP01 migration capacity as well as a significant decrease in cell invasiveness. Moreover, functional analysis based on grouping of all differentially expressed mRNAs identified a total of 35 genes (5 up-regulated and 30 down-regulated) encoding proteins involved in cellular invasion and migration. According to current literature, 9 of these 35 genes (DOCK2, ZNF503, PDE4D, ABL1, ABL2, LPAR1, SMAD2, WASF3 and DACH1) are possibly related to the mechanisms used by PIWIL1 to promote carcinogenic effects related to migration and invasion, since their functions are consistent with the changes observed (being up- or down-regulated after knockout). CONCLUSION Taken together, these data reinforce the idea that PIWIL1 plays a crucial role in the signaling pathway of gastric cancer, regulating several genes involved in migration and invasion processes; therefore, its use as a therapeutic target may generate promising results in the treatment of gastric cancer. © The Author(s) 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated RAS signaling cascade is the primary driver of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), a pediatric cancer characterized by a block in myogenic differentiation. To investigate the cellular function of activated RAS signaling in regulating the growth and differentiation of ERMS cells, we genetically ablated activated RAS oncogenes with high-efficiency genome-editing technology. Knockout of NRAS in CRISPR-inducible ERMS xenograft models resulted in near-complete tumor regression through a combination of cell death and myogenic differentiation. Utilizing this strategy for therapeutic RAS targeting in ERMS, we developed a recombinant oncolytic myxoma virus (MYXV) engineered with CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing capability. Treatment of pre-clinical human ERMS tumor xenografts with an NRAS-targeting version of this MYXV significantly reduced tumor growth and increased overall survival. Our data suggest that targeted gene-editing cancer therapies have promising translational applications, especially with improvements to gene-targeting specificity and oncolytic vector technology. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) has a poor prognosis because of the lack of specific biomarkers and its late diagnosis. An accurate and rapid diagnosis implemented early enough can significantly improve the disease outcome. Vibrational spectroscopy has proven to be useful for cell and tissue characterization based on the intrinsic molecular information. Here, we have applied infrared and Raman microspectroscopy and imaging to differentiate between non-IBC and IBC at both cell and tissue levels. Two human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and SUM-149), 20 breast cancer patients (10 non-IBC and 10 IBC), and 4 healthy volunteer biopsies were investigated. Fixed cells and tissues were analyzed by FTIR microspectroscopy and imaging, while live cells were studied by Raman microspectroscopy. Spectra were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and images by common k-means clustering algorithms. For both cell suspensions and single cells, FTIR spectroscopy showed sufficient high inter-group variability to delineate MDA-MB-231 and SUM-149 cell lines. Most significant differences were observed in the spectral regions of 1096-1108 and 1672-1692 cm−1. Analysis of live cells by Raman microspectroscopy gave also a good discrimination of these cell types. The most discriminant regions were 688-992, 1019-1114, 1217-1375 and 1516-1625 cm−1. Finally, k-means cluster analysis of FTIR images allowed delineating non-IBC from IBC tissues. This study demonstrates the potential of vibrational spectroscopy and imaging to discriminate between non-IBC and IBC at both cell and tissue levels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

For in vitro experiments, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, clone formation, tumor cell invasion assays, and western blot analysis (WBA) were performed to confirm the variations in the proliferation and invasiveness of PCCs, prior and subsequent to transfection with an miR-93 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), which blocks miR-93 binding to its target. Furthermore, the effect of miR-93 on the proliferation of PCCs was examined. Finally, the expression levels of the target genes of miR-93 were determined by WBA. miR-93 expression was higher in PC tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues, and a reduction in the miR-93 level remarkably inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of PCCs. Moreover, miR-93 enhanced the expression of its target genes TGFΒR2, ITGB8, and LATS2. The results of this study suggest that miR-93 may promote the proliferation and invasion of PCCs by upregulating its target genes TGFBR2, ITGB8, and LATS2. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: The National Cancer Institute drug pair screening effort against 60 well-characterized human tumor cell lines (NCI-60) presents an unprecedented resource for modeling combinational drug activity. Results: We present a computational model for predicting cell line response to a subset of drug pairs in the NCI-ALMANAC database. Based on residual neural networks for encoding features as well as predicting tumor growth, our model explains 94% of the response variance. While our best result is achieved with a combination of molecular feature types (gene expression, microRNA and proteome), we show that most of the predictive power comes from drug descriptors. To further demonstrate value in detecting anticancer therapy, we rank the drug pairs for each cell line based on model predicted combination effect and recover 80% of the top pairs with enhanced activity. Conclusions: We present promising results in applying deep learning to predicting combinational drug response. Our feature analysis indicates screening data involving more cell lines are needed for the models to make better use of molecular features. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metabolic changes induced by pancreatic cancer were investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy of plasma samples of patients and healthy controls. The acquired data were submitted to multivariate statistical analysis providing clear discrimination between both groups. The most significant differences were found in levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate and lactate. The obtained results (100% sensitivity, 90% specificity) clearly show the potential of 1H NMR spectroscopy in pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Therefore, the NMR-based metabolomics may contribute to the early diagnosis, prevention and/or therapy of diseases in the future. On the other hand, the number of samples in the presented pilot study is limited and has to be significantly increased in the future in order to obtain solid statistical models and to confirm the current findings. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Capsaicin (CAP) has been long known for its analgesic properties and more recently for its antitumor activity in various cell types. However, its pungency and the high doses needed to achieve a significant activity have precluded its application in cancer therapy. Herein, we propose a straightforward novel strategy to improve the antitumor effect of CAP based on the enhancement of its aggregation propensity in aqueous media by covalent attachment of a BODIPY (BDP) dye. The target CAP-BDP 1 self-assembles in aqueous solutions into weakly fluorescent globular assemblies that become highly emissive upon cell uptake-induced disassembly. Remarkably, due to the improved delivery to the tumour tissue upon aggregation, we have succeeded in reducing the doses of CAP-based drugs in vivo in prostate cancer by two orders of magnitude while maintaining a substantial antitumor activity. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: The value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and quantitative parameters (Ktrans, Kep, Ve) in detecting prognostic factor at 3.0 Tesla remains unclear, especially in predicting prognosis of breast cancer. Methods: A total of 151 patients with IDC underwent breast DCE-MRI and DWI-MRI at 3.0 Tesla following surgery. The ADC values were acquired with b values of 0 and 1000 s/mm 2 . The relationship between ADC values or DCE-MRI quantitative parameters and size, histologic grade (HG), lymph node metastasis (LNM), ER, PR, and Ki67 was evaluated. The predictive values of ADC, Ktrans, Kep, and Ve to prognosis of IDC were assessed. Results: ADC value was positively related to size (P = 0.04) and HER2 (P = 0.046) expression and negatively related to ER (P = 0.012) and PR (P &lt; 0.001) expression. Ktrans value has positive correlation with size (P &lt; 0.001), HG (P &lt; 0.001), LNM (P &lt; 0.001), HER2 (P = 0.007), and Ki67 (P &lt; 0.001) expression and negative correlation with ER (P &lt; 0.001) and PR (P &lt; 0.001) expression. Kep value was positively related to size (P &lt; 0.001) and negatively related to ER (P &lt; 0.001) and PR (P &lt; 0.001) expression. Ve value was negatively related to HER2 expression (P = 0.004). The Cox hazard ratio (HR) of ADC, Ktrans, Kep, and Ve values on survival was 5.26 (P = 0.093), 1.081 (P = 0.002), 1.006 (P = 0.941), and 0.883 (P = 0.926), respectively. Conclusions: Ktrans value was a best predictive indicator of HG, LNM, ER, PR, and Ki67 expression, and ADC value was the best predictive indicator of HER2.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, many subcellular proteins have emerged as promising therapeutic targets in oncology. One crucial target is the epidermal growth factor receptor. Inhibition of this receptor has significantly improved the survival rate of patients for many cancers. However, oncogenic mutations such as B-RAFV600E have rendered tumours resistant to this therapeutic approach. Therefore, this mutation has emerged as a potential target for cancer therapy. Sorafenib is developed to overcome the B-RAFV600E mutation and restore the response of the mutated tumour to therapy. Here, we explore the efficacy and distribution of sorafenib at a cellular level using colon cancer cell lines with B-RAFV600E or K-RASG12V mutations. The Raman results detected significant sorafenib-induced spectral differences in both cell lines. In addition, the western blot and real-time cell analysis in vitro assays revealed that the ERK phosphorylation and the cellular proliferation of cells are inhibited, respectively, in the sorafenib-treated cells. Thus, the observed Raman spectral changes illustrate the potent effect of sorafenib on cells despite the presence of the B-RAFV600E or K-RASG12V mutations. These results are in agreement with the clinical studies, where patients with the B-RAFV600E mutation respond to sorafenib. Furthermore, the Raman spectral imaging results have shown the uptake and the distribution of sorafenib in colon cancer cells with the B-RAFV600E mutation through its label-free marker bands in the fingerprint region. The present results of sorafenib efficacy and distribution in cells demonstrate the potential of Raman micro-spectroscopy as the in vitro assay for the assessment of drugs, which is important in drug discovery. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Heparanase is a mammalian endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides and contributes to remodelling of the extracellular matrix and regulation of HS-binding protein bioavailabilities. Heparanase is upregulated in malignant cancers and inflammation, aiding cell migration and the release of signaling molecules. It is established as a highly druggable extracellular target for anticancer therapy, but current compounds have limitations, because of cost, production complexity, or off-target effects. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel, targeted library of single-entity glycomimetic clusters capped with simple sulfated saccharides. Several dendrimer HS glycomimetics display low nM IC 50 potency for heparanase inhibition equivalent to comparator compounds in clinical development, and potently inhibit metastasis and growth of human myeloma tumor cells in a mouse xenograft model. Importantly, they lack anticoagulant activity and cytotoxicity, and also inhibit angiogenesis. They provide a new candidate class for anticancer and wider therapeutic applications, which could benefit from targeted heparanase inhibition. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the second most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality in the world, with Eastern Asia having the highest incidence rates. E2F is a family of transcription factor proteins that has a variety of functions, which include control of cell cycle, cell differentiation, DNA damage response and cell death. E2F transcription factors are divided into two subfamilies: transcription activators (E2F transcription factors 1 (E2F1), 2 (E2F2) and 3a (E2F3a)) and repressors (E2F3b, E2F transcription factors 4 (E2F4), 5 (E2F5), 6 (E2F6), 7 (E2F7) and 8 (E2F8)). Studies have demonstrated that E2F had prognostic significance in a number of cancers. However, the entirety of the prognostic roles of E2F mRNA expression in GC has not yet been apparently determined. In the present study, the prognostic value of individual family members of E2F mRNA expression for overall survival (OS) was evaluated by using online Kaplan-Meier Plotter (KM Plotter) database. Our result demonstrated that high expressions of three family members of E2F (E2F1, E2F3, E2F4) mRNA were significantly associated with unfavourable OS in all GC patients. However, increased expressions of E2F2, E2F5, E2F6 and E2F7 were significantly associated with favourable OS, especially for higher clinical stages in GC patients. These results provided a better insight into the prognostic functions of E2F mRNA genes in GC. Although the results should be further verified in clinical trials, our findings may be a favourable prognostic predictor for the development of newer therapeutic drugs in the treatment of GC. © 2018 The Author(s).

After incubation of the cells with cisplatin, 1 and 2 for 48 hours, distinct changes were found in the ATR-FT-IR spectra. Comparison of the second derivative spectra suggests that 1 and 2 induce similar chemical changes in both cell lines, A2780 and A2780R, while cisplatin had a slight effect on A2780 and A2780R cells. Furthermore, drugs 1 and 2 result in changes to the phosphodiester and polysaccharide bands in the spectra. This work shows how ATR-FT-IR can be applied to monitor the effects of organoamidoplatinum(ii) complexes on cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant cell lines providing potential information on how drugs affect the cellular metabolism. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "A major risk for patients having estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive breast cancer is the recurrence of drug-resistant metastases after initial successful treatment with endocrine therapies. Recent studies have implicated a number of activating mutations in the ligand-binding domain of ERα that stabilize the agonist conformation as a prominent mechanism for this acquired resistance. There are several critical gaps in our knowledge regarding the specific pharmacophore requirements of an antagonist that could effectively inhibit all or most of the different mutant ERs. To address this, we screened various chemotypes for blocking mutant ER-mediated transcriptional signaling and identified RU58668 as a model compound that contains structural elements that support potent ligand-induced inhibition of mutant ERs. We designed and synthesized a focused library of novel antagonists and probed how small and large perturbations in different ligand structural regions influenced inhibitory activity on individual mutant ERs in breast cancer cells. Effective inhibition derives from both nonpolar and moderately polar motifs in a multifunctional side chain of the antagonists, with the nature of the ligand core making important contributions by increasing the potency of ligands possessing similar types of side chains. Some of our new antagonists potently blocked the transcriptional activity of the three most common mutant ERs (L536R, Y537S, D538G) and inhibited mutant ER-mediated cell proliferation. Supported by our molecular modeling, these studies provide new insights into the role of specific components, involving both the ligand core and multifunctional side chain, in suppressing wild-type and mutant ER-mediated transcription and breast cancer cell proliferation. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to generate a novel miRNA expression signature to accurately predict prognosis for patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Patients and methods: Using expression profiles downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we identified multiple miRNAs with differential expression between LUAD and paired healthy tissues. We then evaluated the prognostic values of the differentially expressed miRNAs using univariate/multivariate Cox regression analysis. This analysis was ultimately used to construct a four-miRNA signature that effectively predicted patient survival. Finally, we analyzed potential functional roles of the target genes for these four miRNAs using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses. Results: Based on our cutoff criteria (P<0.05 and |log2FC| >1.0), we identified a total of 187 differentially expressed miRNAs, including 148 that were upregulated in LUAD tissues and 39 that were downregulated. Four miRNAs (miR-148a-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-548v, and miR-550a-5p) were independently associated with survival based on Kaplan–Meier analysis. We generated a signature index based on the expression of these four miRNAs and stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups. Patients in the high-risk group had significantly shorter survival times than those in the low-risk group (P=0.002). A functional enrichment analysis suggested that the target genes of these four miRNAs were involved in protein phosphorylation and the Hippo and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that our four-miRNA signature can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with LUAD. © 2018 Lin et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) contained in exosomes have been recognized as promising stable biomarkers in cancers. H19 is a well-known oncogenic lncRNA, but whether extracellular H19 is contained in exosomes and the clinical significance of exosomal H19 are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess se-rum-derived exosomal H19 lncRNA as a cancer predictive marker. Material/Methods: Exosomes from serum of bladder cancer (BC) patients were isolated using the ExoQuick purification method and identified using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. RT-qPCR was used for the measurement of H19 expression in serum or tissue samples. Results: Serum H19 was little influenced by the treatment of RNase A alone but was dramatically downregulated when treated with RNase A and Triton ×100 simultaneously. The concentration of H19 was significantly higher in serum exosomes than in exosome-depleted supernatants in serum. Then, we validated that exosomal H19 is stable in serum by exposing serum samples to prolonged conditions of room temperature, 4°C, multiple freeze-thaw cycles, and low/high pH. Serum exosomal H19 of BC patients was positively correlated with total H19 level in paired BC tissues, and exosomal H19 was significantly downregulated in postoperative samples when compared to the paired preoperative samples. In addition, exosomal H19 level was significantly increased in serum of BC patients when compared to healthy people and benign disease patients. More importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that higher serum exosomal H19 level in BC patients was correlated with poorer survival. Conclusions: Detection of serum exosomal H19 shed light on using exosomal lncRNAs as a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for BC patients. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "An enantioselective fluorination of 3-functionalized oxindoles using electron-rich amino urea catalyst is described. Various 3-functionalized 3-fluoro-2-oxindoles were obtained in good yields and enantio-selectivity. The resulting enantioenriched 3-methylene nitrile 3-fluoro-2-oxindole product was found to inhibit indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase considerably. (Figure presented.). © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Ewing sarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer that promotes the infiltration and activation of pro-tumor M2-like macrophages. Oncolytic virotherapy that selectively infects and destroys cancer cells is a promising option for treating Ewing sarcoma. The effect of tumor macrophages on oncolytic virus therapy, however, is variable among solid tumors and is unknown in Ewing sarcoma. We tested the effects of macrophage reduction using liposomal clodronate (Clodrosome) and trabectedin on the antitumor efficacy of intratumoral oncolytic herpes simplex virus, rRp450, in two Ewing sarcoma xenograft models. Both agents enhanced antitumor efficacy without increasing virus replication. The most profound effects were in A673 with only a transient effect on response rates in TC71. Interestingly, A673 was more dependent than TC71 on macrophages for its tumorigenesis. We found Clodrosome and virus together induced expression of antitumorigenic genes and reduced expression of protumorigenic genes in both the tumor-associated macrophages and the overall tumor stroma. Trabectedin reduced intratumoral natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and M2-like macrophages, and prevented their increase following virotherapy. Our data suggest that a combination of trabectedin and oncolytic herpes virotherapy warrants testing in the clinical setting. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "We generated two humanized interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL-13Rα2) chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), Hu07BBz and Hu08BBz, that recognized human IL-13Rα2, but not IL-13Rα1. Hu08BBz also recognized canine IL-13Rα2. Both of these CAR T cell constructs demonstrated superior tumor inhibitory effects in a subcutaneous xenograft model of human glioma compared with a humanized EGFRvIII CAR T construct used in a recent phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02209376). The Hu08BBz demonstrated a 75% reduction in orthotopic tumor growth using low-dose CAR T cell infusion. Using combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockade, humanized IL-13Rα2 CAR T cells performed significantly better when combined with CTLA-4 blockade, and humanized EGFRvIII CAR T cells’ efficacy was improved by PD-1 and TIM-3 blockade in the same mouse model, which was correlated with the levels of checkpoint molecule expression in co-cultures with the same tumor in vitro. Humanized IL-13Rα2 CAR T cells also demonstrated benefit from a self-secreted anti-CTLA-4 minibody in the same mouse model. In addition to a canine glioma cell line (J3T), canine osteosarcoma lung cancer and leukemia cell lines also express IL-13Rα2 and were recognized by Hu08BBz. Canine IL-13Rα2 CAR T cell was also generated and tested in vitro by co-culture with canine tumor cells and in vivo in an orthotopic model of canine glioma. Based on these results, we are designing a pre-clinical trial to evaluate the safety of canine IL-13Rα2 CAR T cells in dog with spontaneous IL-13Rα2-positive glioma, which will help to inform a human clinical trial design for glioblastoma using humanized scFv-based IL-13Rα2 targeting CAR T cells. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "A cascade reaction of thioamides with 6β-bromoandrostenedione in hexafluoroisopropanol formed substituted thiazolo-androstenones. This is a simple and mild protocol to synthesize novel molecules by using readily available reagents and substrates. Feasibility of the reaction has been rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, these compounds are potent growth inhibitors of colon, central nervous system, melanoma, ovarian, and renal cancer cell lines with 50% growth inhibition values as low as 1.04 μM. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The first asymmetric total synthesis of ophiorrhisine A (1), a new cyclic tetrapeptide isolated from Ophiorrhiza nutans, was accomplished via an intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction (IMSNAr) of a linear tripeptide to construct a 14-membered paracyclophane ring, resulting in confirmation of its structure and absolute configuration. The structure-activity relationship study of 1 and its derivatives demonstrated that some derivatives possessed cytotoxicity toward human cancer cell lines A549, HT29, and HCT116. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The development of new imaging tools, molecules and modalities is crucial to understanding biological processes and the localised cellular impact of bioactive compounds. A small molecule photosensitiser, DC473, has been designed to be both highly fluorescent and to exhibit a strong Raman signal in the cell-silent region of the Raman spectrum due to a diphenylacetylene structure. DC473 has been utilised to perform a range of novel tandem fluorescence and Raman (fluoRaman) imaging experiments, enabling a thorough examination of the compound's cellular localisation, exemplified in colorectal cancer cells (SW480). This multifunctional fluoRaman imaging modality revealed the presence of the compound in lipid droplets and only a weak signal in the cytosol, by both Raman and fluorescence imaging. In addition, Raman microscopy detected the compound in a cell compartment we labelled as the nucleolus, whereas fluorescence microscopy did not detect the fluoRaman probe due to solvatochromatic effects in a local polar environment. This last finding was only possible with the use of tandem confocal Raman and fluorescence methods. By following the approach detailed herein, incorporation of strong Raman functional groups into fluorophores can enable a plethora of fluoRaman experiments, shedding further light on potential drug compound's cellular behaviour and biological activity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "We used an electron-transfer carbohydrate-mimetic peptide (YYYYC) to construct an electrochemical cytosensing system. Magnetic beads were modified with either asialofetuin (ASF) or soybean agglutinin (SBA) to evaluate the effect on cell sensing. Because SBA binds to the galactose residue that exists at the terminals of the carbohydrate chains in ASF, the target protein was accumulated on the protein magnetic beads. SBA is an example of N-acetylgalactosamine- and galactose-binding proteins that readily combine with YYYYC. When the peptides and protein-immobilized beads competed for a target protein, the peak current of the peptides changed according to the concentration of the protein at the 10−12 M level. Next, human myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cell) were measured using the peptide and the carbohydrate chains on the cell surface that recognize SBA. The electrode response was linear to the number of K562 cells and ranged from 1.0 × 102 to 5.0 × 103 cells mL−1. In addition, detection of a human liver cancer cell (HepG2 cell) was carried out using interactions with the peptide, the ASF receptors in HepG2 cells, and the carbohydrate chains of ASF. The peak currents were proportional and ranged between 5.0 × 101 and 1.5 × 103 cells mL−1. When the values estimated from an electrochemical process were compared with those obtained by ELISA, the results were within the acceptable range of measurement error. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Abnormal O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) concentrations have been associated with a variety of diseases (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, etc.). However, O-GlcNAc detection is complicated, time-consuming and has poor specificity, therefore, the accurate detection of O-GlcNAc is difficult. In this study, an accurate and sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor for O-GlcNAc detection that is based on β-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA) and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed. In this strategy, AuNPs were used to amplify the SPR signal and improve the biosensor's sensitivity; OGA was used to cleave O-GlcNAc from O-GlcNAcylated biomolecules. The interaction between AuNPs labeled wheat germ agglutinin (AuNPs/WGA) and O-GlcNAcylated biomolecules on a modified Au film treated with and without OGA was recorded by SPR. The change of the SPR signal moves linearly with the amount of O-GlcNAc on the Au film and thus could be used for the detection of O-GlcNAc. By recording the difference of the SPR signals, this method can avoid disturbances from other sugars and nonspecific adsorption of AuNPs and thus enable the accurate detection of O-GlcNAc. The accurate detection range of O-GlcNAc was 4.65 × 10 −12 to 4.65 × 10 −7 M which was obtained by quantifying the amount of a standard O-GlcNAcylated peptide (O-GlcNAc-CREB), and the detection limit is 4.65 × 10 −13 M. More importantly, the strategy was successfully used to detect O-GlcNAc in a real α-crystallin protein, cancer cell lysates and blood samples with satisfactory results. The study's results imply that this accurate and sensitive method has the potential to be applied in the early clinical diagnosis of O-GlcNAc-related diseases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Despite high remission rates following CAR-T cell therapy in B-ALL, relapse due to loss of the targeted antigen is increasingly recognized as a mechanism of immune escape. We hypothesized that simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22 may reduce the likelihood of antigen loss, thus improving sustained remission rates. A systematic approach to the generation of CAR constructs incorporating two target-binding domains led to several novel CD19/CD22 bivalent CAR constructs. Importantly, we demonstrate the challenges associated with the construction of a bivalent CAR format that preserves bifunctionality against both CD19 and CD22. Using the most active bivalent CAR constructs, we found similar transduction efficiency compared to that of either CD19 or CD22 single CARs alone. When expressed on human T cells, the optimized CD19/CD22 CAR construct induced comparable interferon γ and interleukin-2 in vitro compared to single CARs against dual-antigen-expressing as well as single-antigen-expressing cell lines. Finally, the T cells expressing CD19/CD22 CAR eradicated ALL cell line xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), including a PDX generated from a patient with CD19− relapse following CD19-directed CAR therapy. The CD19/CD22 bivalent CAR provides an opportunity to test whether simultaneous targeting may reduce risk of antigen loss. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Tumor markers have been regularly detected for early cancer diagnosis in clinical oncology. The development of facile and low cost technology has become an important challenge for their diagnosis. We here report a low-cost plasmonic silver needle (PSN) for immunofluorescence detection of tumor biomarkers. The fluorescence signal is enhanced on the needle by up to 220-fold, allowing high-performance detection of tumor markers down to 0.08 ng mL-1. To assess the clinical potential of the proposed assay technique, PSN-based sandwich immunoassay for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen were performed for blood as well as for serum sample. The results from serum sample have an excellent agreement with an electrochemluminecence assay. The small relative error and a good linear correlation suggest that the accuracy and precision of this analytical technology are satisfactory. This assay technique with lower cost, use of less sample, higher sensitivity and easier procedure shows great promise for the facile and early cancer diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) constantly sample peripheral tissues for antigens, which are subsequently ingested to derive peptides for presentation to T cells in lymph nodes. To do so, DCs have to traverse many different tissues with varying oxygen tensions. Additionally, DCs are often exposed to low oxygen tensions in tumors, where vascularization is lacking, as well as in inflammatory foci, where oxygen is rapidly consumed by inflammatory cells during the respiratory burst. DCs respond to oxygen levels to tailor immune responses to such low-oxygen environments. In the present study, we identified a mechanism of hypoxia-mediated potentiation of release of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory cytokine with important roles in both anti-cancer immunity and autoimmune disease. We show in human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) that this potentiation is controlled exclusively via the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We identified MAPK kinase kinase 8 (MAP3K8) as a target gene of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF), a transcription factor controlled by oxygen tension, upstream of the p38/MAPK pathway. Hypoxia increased expression of MAP3K8 concomitant with the potentiation of TNF-α secretion. This potentiation was no longer observed upon siRNA silencing of MAP3K8 or with a small molecule inhibitor of this kinase, and this also decreased p38/MAPK phosphorylation. However, expression of DC maturation markers CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR were not changed by hypoxia. Since DCs play an important role in controlling T-cell activation and differentiation, our results provide novel insight in understanding T-cell responses in inflammation, cancer, autoimmune disease and other diseases where hypoxia is involved. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies is a major factor in limiting the effectiveness of cancer treatment. In many cases, resistance can be linked to genetic changes in target proteins, either pre-existing or evolutionarily selected during treatment. Key to overcoming this challenge is an understanding of the molecular determinants of drug binding. Using multi-stage pipelines of molecular simulations we can gain insights into the binding free energy and the residence time of a ligand, which can inform both stratified and personal treatment regimes and drug development. To support the scalable, adaptive and automated calculation of the binding free energy on high-performance computing resources, we introduce the High-throughput Binding Affinity Calculator (HTBAC). HTBAC uses a building block approach in order to attain both workflow flexibility and performance. Results: We demonstrate close to perfect weak scaling to hundreds of concurrent multi-stage binding affinity calculation pipelines. This permits a rapid time-to-solution that is essentially invariant of the calculation protocol, size of candidate ligands and number of ensemble simulations. Conclusions: As such, HTBAC advances the state of the art of binding affinity calculations and protocols. HTBAC provides the platform to enable scientists to study a wide range of cancer drugs and candidate ligands in order to support personalized clinical decision making based on genome sequencing and drug discovery. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "One of the treatment failures for colorectal cancer (CRC) is resistance to chemotherapy drugs. miRNAs have been demonstrated to be a new regulator of pathobiological processes in various tumors. While few studies have explored the specific role of miR-141 in mediating 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitivity of CRC cells, the present study aimed to detect the contribution of miR-141 in 5-FU sensitivity. The CRC cells viability was measured by MTS assay and cell colony forming. The expression of miR-141 and its downstream targets were assessed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The functional assays were conducted using CRC cells and nude mice. At the present study, we found overexpression of miR-141 could inhibit proliferation, migration, tumor-forming and invasive potential of CRC cells in vitro and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) was verified as a directed target of miR-141. The combination treatment of miR-141 with 5-FU, directly targetting MAP4K4, could better inhibit invasion and metastasis of CRC cells colony than either one alone. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-141, targetting MAP4K4, enhanced the effected of 5-FU and suppressed the malignant biological behaviors, in vivo. Our findings showed that 5-FU inhibited malignant behavior of human CRC cells in vitro and in vivo by enhancing the efficiency of miR-141. Our data suggested that targetting the miR-141/MAP4K4 signaling pathway could be a potential molecular target that may enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in the treatment of CRC. © 2018 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "AIM To examine the effect of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum ) on the microenvironment of colonic neoplasms and the expression of inflammatory mediators and microRNAs (miRNAs). METHODS Levels of F. nucleatum DNA, cytokine gene mRNA (TLR2 , TLR4 , NFKB1 , TNF , IL1B , IL6 and IL8 ), and potentially interacting miRNAs (miR-21-3p, miR-22-3p, miR-28-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-135b-5p) were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) TaqMan ® assays in DNA and/or RNA extracted from the disease and adjacent normal fresh tissues of 27 colorectal adenoma (CRA) and 43 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. KRAS mutations were detected by direct sequencing and microsatellite instability (MSI) status by multiplex PCR. Cytoscape v3.1.1 was used to construct the postulated miRNA:mRNA interaction network. RESULTS Overabundance of F. nucleatum in neoplastic tissue compared to matched normal tissue was detected in CRA (51.8%) and more markedly in CRC (72.1%). We observed significantly greater expression of TLR4 , IL1B , IL8 , and miR-135b in CRA lesions and TLR2 , IL1B , IL6 , IL8 , miR-34a and miR-135b in CRC tumours compared to their respective normal tissues. Only two transcripts for miR-22 and miR-28 were exclusively downregulated in CRC tumour samples. The mRNA expression of IL1B , IL6 , IL8 and miR-22 was positively correlated with F. nucleatum quantification in CRC tumours. The mRNA expression of miR-135b and TNF was inversely correlated. The miRNA:mRNA interaction network suggested that the upregulation of miR-34a in CRC proceeds via a TLR2 /TLR4 -dependent response to F. nucleatum . Finally, KRAS mutations were more frequently observed in CRC samples infected with F. nucleatum and were associated with greater expression of miR-21 in CRA, while IL8 was upregulated in MSI-high CRC. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that F. nucleatum is a risk factor for CRC by increasing the expression of inflammatory mediators through a possible miRNA-mediated activation of TLR2 /TLR4 . © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "Background: Deep Learning (DL) has advanced the state-of-the-art capabilities in bioinformatics applications which has resulted in trends of increasingly sophisticated and computationally demanding models trained by larger and larger data sets. This vastly increased computational demand challenges the feasibility of conducting cutting-edge research. One solution is to distribute the vast computational workload across multiple computing cluster nodes with data parallelism algorithms. In this study, we used a High-Performance Computing environment and implemented the Downpour Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm for data parallelism to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the natural language processing task of information extraction from a massive dataset of cancer pathology reports. We evaluated the scalability improvements using data parallelism training and the Titan supercomputer at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. To evaluate scalability, we used different numbers of worker nodes and performed a set of experiments comparing the effects of different training batch sizes and optimizer functions. Results: We found that Adadelta would consistently converge at a lower validation loss, though requiring over twice as many training epochs as the fastest converging optimizer, RMSProp. The Adam optimizer consistently achieved a close 2nd place minimum validation loss significantly faster; using a batch size of 16 and 32 allowed the network to converge in only 4.5 training epochs. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the networked training process is scalable across multiple compute nodes communicating with message passing interface while achieving higher classification accuracy compared to a traditional machine learning algorithm. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor cells frequently evade applied therapies through the accumulation of genomic mutations and rapid evolution. In the case of oncolytic virotherapy, understanding the mechanisms by which cancer cells develop resistance to infection and lysis is critical to the development of more effective viral-based platforms. Here, we identify APOBEC3 as an important factor that restricts the potency of oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). We show that VSV infection of B16 murine melanoma cells upregulated APOBEC3 in an IFN-β-dependent manner, which was responsible for the evolution of virus-resistant cell populations and suggested that APOBEC3 expression promoted the acquisition of a virus-resistant phenotype. Knockdown of APOBEC3 in B16 cells diminished their capacity to develop resistance to VSV infection in vitro and enhanced the therapeutic effect of VSV in vivo. Similarly, overexpression of human APOBEC3B promoted the acquisition of resistance to oncolytic VSV both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that APOBEC3B expression had a direct effect on the fitness of VSV, an RNA virus that has not previously been identified as restricted by APOBEC3B. This research identifies APOBEC3 enzymes as key players to target in order to improve the efficacy of viral or broader nucleic acid-based therapeutic platforms. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: Manual extraction of information from electronic pathology (epath) reports to populate the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database is labor intensive. Systematizing the data extraction automatically using machine-learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) is desirable to reduce the human labor required to populate the SEER database and to improve the timeliness of the data. This enables scaling up registry efficiency and collection of new data elements. To ensure the integrity, quality, and continuity of the SEER data, the misclassification error of ML and NPL algorithms needs to be negligible. Current algorithms fail to achieve the precision of human experts who can bring additional information in their assessments. Differences in registry format and the desire to develop a common information extraction platform further complicate the ML/NLP tasks. The purpose of our study is to develop triage rules to partially automate registry workflow to improve the precision of the auto-extracted information. Results: This paper presents a mathematical framework to improve the precision of a classifier beyond that of the Bayes classifier by selectively classifying item that are most likely to be correct. This results in a triage rule that only classifies a subset of the item. We characterize the optimal triage rule and demonstrate its usefulness in the problem of classifying cancer site from electronic pathology reports to achieve a desired precision. Conclusions: From the mathematical formalism, we propose a heuristic estimate for triage rule based on post-processing the soft-max output from standard machine learning algorithms. We show, in test cases, that the triage rule significantly improve the classification accuracy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Photoresponsive materials are emerging as ideal carriers for precisely controlled drug delivery owing to their high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, drawbacks such as slow release kinetics, inherent toxicity, and lack of targeting ability hinder their translation into clinical use. We constructed a new DNA aptamer-grafted photoresponsive hyperbranched polymer, which can self-assemble into nanoparticles, thereby achieving biocompatibility and target specificity, as well as light-controllable release behavior. Upon UV-irradiation, rapid release induced by disassembly was observed for Nile Red-loaded nanoparticles. Further in vitro cell studies confirmed this delivery system's specific binding and internalization performance arising from the DNA aptamer corona. The DOX-loaded nanoassembly exhibited selective phototriggered cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, indicating its promising therapeutic effect as a smart drug delivery system. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: Gene signatures are important to represent the molecular changes in the disease genomes or the cells in specific conditions, and have been often used to separate samples into different groups for better research or clinical treatment. While many methods and applications have been available in literature, there still lack powerful ones that can take account of the complex data and detect the most informative signatures. Methods: In this article, we present a new framework for identifying gene signatures using Pareto-optimal cluster size identification for RNA-seq data. We first performed pre-filtering steps and normalization, then utilized the empirical Bayes test in Limma package to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Next, we used a multi-objective optimization technique, \"Multi-objective optimization for collecting cluster alternatives\" (MOCCA in R package) on these DEGs to find Pareto-optimal cluster size, and then applied k-means clustering to the RNA-seq data based on the optimal cluster size. The best cluster was obtained through computing the average Spearman's Correlation Score among all the genes in pair-wise manner belonging to the module. The best cluster is treated as the signature for the respective disease or cellular condition. Results: We applied our framework to a cervical cancer RNA-seq dataset, which included 253 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples and 22 adenocarcinoma (ADENO) samples. We identified a total of 582 DEGs by Limma analysis of SCC versus ADENO samples. Among them, 260 are up-regulated genes and 322 are down-regulated genes. Using MOCCA, we obtained seven Pareto-optimal clusters. The best cluster has a total of 35 DEGs consisting of all-upregulated genes. For validation, we ran PAMR (prediction analysis for microarrays) classifier on the selected best cluster, and assessed the classification performance. Our evaluation, measured by sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy, showed high confidence. Conclusions: Our framework identified a multi-objective based cluster that is treated as a signature that can classify the disease and control group of samples with higher classification performance (accuracy 0.935) for the corresponding disease. Our method is useful to find signature for any RNA-seq or microarray data. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but these can be reduced significantly with population screening using annual fecal occult blood tests (FOBT)A positive FOBT requires timely follow-up with colonoscopy to maximize screening benefits. Several barriers to follow-up have been identified, with patient health behaviors and choices comprising a significant part of these. The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) assesses knowledge, skills, beliefs, and confidence in managing health. Increased patient activation is related to positive health outcomes. The aim of this study is to examine the association between patient empowerment, as reflected in the PAM, and follow-up colonoscopy within 90 days of a positive FOBT result. Methods: This case-control study included 429 patients with a positive FOBT, 174 who had a colonoscopy within 90 days, and 255 who did not. Participants completed a PAM telephone questionnaire (Cronbach's α = 0.785). We used both univariate and multivariate analyses to examine the effect of the PAM score as on the likelihood of undergoing colonoscopy, after adjusting for the independent variables. Results: In this study we did not find a significant association between PAM and adherence to colonoscopy, using both univariate and multivariate analyses (p =.334 and p =.697, whether PAM was defined as a continuous or as categorical, respectively). Conclusions: This study was the first to examine the association between patient empowerment, as reflected in the patient activation measure, and adherence to colonoscopy after a positive FOBT. The findings did not support such an association. Further examination is required to clarify the relation between patient empowerment and activation and personal healthcare in general, and in the Israeli population in particular. Future policy should include specific, technical interventions to improve FOBT follow-up among all groups, until the patient-related barriers are better understood.

    "Abstract": "Background: Real-time analysis of patient data during medical procedures can provide vital diagnostic feedback that significantly improves chances of success. With sensors becoming increasingly fast, frameworks such as Deep Neural Networks are required to perform calculations within the strict timing constraints for real-time operation. However, traditional computing platforms responsible for running these algorithms incur a large overhead due to communication protocols, memory accesses, and static (often generic) architectures. In this work, we implement a low-latency Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) processor using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Unlike CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), our FPGA-based design can directly interface sensors, storage devices, display devices and even actuators, thus reducing the delays of data movement between ports and compute pipelines. Moreover, the compute pipelines themselves are tailored specifically to the application, improving resource utilization and reducing idle cycles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using mass-spectrometry data sets for real-time cancer detection. Results: We demonstrate that correct parameter sizing, based on the application, can reduce latency by 20% on average. Furthermore, we show that in an application with tightly coupled data-path and latency constraints, having a large amount of computing resources can actually reduce performance. Using mass-spectrometry benchmarks, we show that our proposed FPGA design outperforms both CPU and GPU implementations, with an average speedup of 144x and 21x, respectively. Conclusion: In our work, we demonstrate the importance of application-specific optimizations in order to minimize latency and maximize resource utilization for MLP inference. By directly interfacing and processing sensor data with ultra-low latency, FPGAs can perform real-time analysis during procedures and provide diagnostic feedback that can be critical to achieving higher percentages of successful patient outcomes. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This work reports the first images obtained by combining an infrared aperture scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) with a quantum cascade laser (QCL). The future potential of this set-up is demonstrated by a preliminary study on an OE33 human oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell in which the cell is imaged at 1751 cm−1, 1651 cm−1, 1539 cm−1 and 1242 cm−1. In addition to the 1651 cm−1 image, three other images were acquired within the Amide I band (1689 cm−1, 1675 cm−1 and 1626 cm−1) chosen to correspond to secondary structures of proteins. The four images obtained within the Amide I band show distinct differences demonstrating the potential of this approach to reveal subtle changes in the chemical composition of a cell. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is an emerging technology that has revolutionized the research of the tumor heterogeneity. However, the highly sparse data matrices generated by the technology have posed an obstacle to the analysis of differential gene regulatory networks. Results: Addressing the challenges, this study presents, as far as we know, the first bioinformatics tool for scRNA-Seq-based differential network analysis (scdNet). The tool features a sample size adjustment of gene-gene correlation, comparison of inter-state correlations, and construction of differential networks. A simulation analysis demonstrated the power of scdNet in the analyses of sparse scRNA-Seq data matrices, with low requirement on the sample size, high computation efficiency, and tolerance of sequencing noises. Applying the tool to analyze two datasets of single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of prostate cancer and early mouse embryos, our data demonstrated that differential gene regulation plays crucial roles in anti-androgen resistance and early embryonic development. Conclusions: Overall, the tool is widely applicable to datasets generated by the emerging technology to bring biological insights into tumor heterogeneity and other studies. MATLAB implementation of scdNet is available at https://github.com/ChenLabGCCRI/scdNet. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins are overexpressed in multiple diseases, including cancer, and have emerged as anticancer drug targets. HDAC proteins regulate cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell proliferation, by deacetylating histone and non-histone substrates. Although a plethora of acetylated proteins have been identified using large-scale proteomic approaches, the HDAC proteins responsible for their dynamic deacetylation have been poorly studied. For example, few substrates of HDAC1 have been identified, which is mainly due to the scarcity of substrate identification tools. We recently developed a mutant trapping strategy to identify novel substrates of HDAC1. Herein, we introduce an improved version of the trapping method that uses mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to identify multiple substrates simultaneously. Among the substrate hits, CDK1, AIFM1, MSH6, and RuvB-like 1 were identified as likely HDAC1 substrates. These newly discovered HDAC1 substrates are involved in various biological processes, suggesting novel functions of HDAC1 apart from epigenetics. Substrate trapping combined with MS-based proteomics provides an efficient approach to HDAC1 substrate identification and contributes to the full characterization of HDAC function in normal and disease states. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "A randomized clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effects on anxiety, depression, stress and optimism levels of an audio-recorded clinical hypnosis intervention and a music session and compare them with a control group in women scheduled for breast biopsy. We analyzed the data of 170 patients with an average age of 47 years, who were randomly assigned to each of the groups. The psychosocial variables were measured in three moments: baseline, which corresponds to the period before the intervention with hypnosis, music or waiting in the room before biopsy; a second measurement after the interventions and a third measurement after the breast biopsy procedure was finished. The results showed a statistically significant reduction in the stress (p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .06); pain, (p &lt; .01, η 2 p = .04); anxiety, (p &lt; .001, ƞ 2 p = .07) and depression, (p &lt; .001, ƞ 2 p = .05) in hypnosis and music groups compared with the control group. Before biopsy, hypnosis decrease significantly pain and depression levels compared with music, but after biopsy there were no differences between both groups. It is recommended to use audio-recorded hypnosis and music interventions to reduce physical and emotional discomfort during the biopsy procedure and to improve the quality of life of patients with suspected breast cancer. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 American Society of Clinical Hypnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Bioinformatics tools have been developed to interpret gene expression data at the gene set level, and these gene set based analyses improve the biologists' capability to discover functional relevance of their experiment design. While elucidating gene set individually, inter-gene sets association is rarely taken into consideration. Deep learning, an emerging machine learning technique in computational biology, can be used to generate an unbiased combination of gene set, and to determine the biological relevance and analysis consistency of these combining gene sets by leveraging large genomic data sets. Results: In this study, we proposed a gene superset autoencoder (GSAE), a multi-layer autoencoder model with the incorporation of a priori defined gene sets that retain the crucial biological features in the latent layer. We introduced the concept of the gene superset, an unbiased combination of gene sets with weights trained by the autoencoder, where each node in the latent layer is a superset. Trained with genomic data from TCGA and evaluated with their accompanying clinical parameters, we showed gene supersets' ability of discriminating tumor subtypes and their prognostic capability. We further demonstrated the biological relevance of the top component gene sets in the significant supersets. Conclusions: Using autoencoder model and gene superset at its latent layer, we demonstrated that gene supersets retain sufficient biological information with respect to tumor subtypes and clinical prognostic significance. Superset also provides high reproducibility on survival analysis and accurate prediction for cancer subtypes. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Pre-processing is an essential step in the analysis of spectral data. Mid-IR spectroscopy of biological samples is often subject to instrumental and sample specific variances which may often conceal valuable biological information. Whilst pre-processing can effectively reduce this unwanted variance, the plethora of possible processing steps has resulted in a lack of consensus in the field, often meaning that analysis outputs are not comparable. As pre-processing is specific to the sample under investigation, here we present a systematic approach for defining the optimum pre-processing protocol for biofluid ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Using a trial-and-error based approach and a clinically relevant dataset describing control and brain cancer patients, the effects of pre-processing permutations on subsequent classification algorithms were observed, by assessing key diagnostic performance parameters, including sensitivity and specificity. It was found that optimum diagnostic performance correlated with the use of minimal binning and baseline correction, with derivative functions improving diagnostic performance most significantly. If smoothing is required, a Sovitzky-Golay approach was the preferred option in this investigation. Heavy binning appeared to reduce classification most significantly, alongside wavelet noise reduction (filter length ≥6), resulting in the lowest diagnostic performances of all pre-processing permutations tested. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Up to date, HCC pathogenesis has not been fully understood. The aim of the present study was to identify crucial genes and pathways associated with HCC by bioinformatics methods. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 14 HCC tissues and corresponding non-cancerous tissues were identified using limma package. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed by clusterProfiler package. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed and visualized by STRING database and Cytoscape software, respectively. The crucial genes in PPI network were identified using a Cytoscape plugin, CytoNCA. Furthermore, the effect of the expression level of the crucial genes on HCC patient survival was analyzed by an interactive web-portal, UALCAN. A total of 870 DEGs including 237 up-regulated and 633 down-regulated genes were identified in HCC tissues. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly enriched in complement and coagulation cascades pathway, chemical carcinogenesis pathway, retinol metabolism pathway, fatty acid degradation pathway, and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway. PPI network analysis showed that CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, MAD2L1, ACACB, IGF1, TOP2A, and EHHADH were crucial genes. Survival analysis suggested that the high expression of CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, MAD2L1, and TOP2A significantly decreased the survival probability of HCC patients. In conclusion, the identification of the above crucial genes and pathways will not only contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis of HCC, but also provide prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for HCC. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A preclinical model of glioblastoma (GB) bystander cell therapy using human adipose mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) is used to address the issues of cell availability, quality, and feasibility of tumor cure. We show that a fast proliferating variety of hAMSCs expressing thymidine kinase (TK) has therapeutic capacity equivalent to that of TK-expressing hAMSCs and can be used in a multiple-inoculation procedure to reduce GB tumors to a chronically inhibited state. We also show that up to 25% of unmodified hAMSCs can be tolerated in the therapeutic procedure without reducing efficacy. Moreover, mimicking a clinical situation, tumor debulking previous to cell therapy inhibits GB tumor growth. To understand these striking results at a cellular level, we used a bioluminescence imaging strategy and showed that tumor-implanted therapeutic cells do not proliferate, are unaffected by GCV, and spontaneously decrease to a stable level. Moreover, using the CLARITY procedure for tridimensional visualization of fluorescent cells in transparent brains, we find therapeutic cells forming vascular-like structures that often associate with tumor cells. In vitro experiments show that therapeutic cells exposed to GCV produce cytotoxic extracellular vesicles and suggest that a similar mechanism may be responsible for the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of TK-expressing hAMSCs. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Background: With applications in cancer, drug metabolism, and disease etiology, understanding structural variation in the human genome is critical in advancing the thrusts of individualized medicine. However, structural variants (SVs) remain challenging to detect with high sensitivity using short read sequencing technologies. This problem is exacerbated when considering complex SVs comprised of multiple overlapping or nested rearrangements. Longer reads, such as those from Pacific Biosciences platforms, often span multiple breakpoints of such events, and thus provide a way to unravel small-scale complexities in SVs with higher confidence. Results: We present CORGi (COmplex Rearrangement detection with Graph-search), a method for the detection and visualization of complex local genomic rearrangements. This method leverages the ability of long reads to span multiple breakpoints to untangle SVs that appear very complicated with respect to a reference genome. We validated our approach against both simulated long reads, and real data from two long read sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the ability of our method to identify breakpoints inserted in synthetic data with high accuracy, and the ability to detect and plot SVs from NA12878 germline, achieving 88.4% concordance between the two sets of sequence data. The patterns of complexity we find in many NA12878 SVs match known mechanisms associated with DNA replication and structural variant formation, and highlight the ability of our method to automatically label complex SVs with an intuitive combination of adjacent or overlapping reference transformations. Conclusions: CORGi is a method for interrogating genomic regions suspected to contain local rearrangements using long reads.

    "Abstract": "Glutathione (GSH) is of significance in human pathology due to its many cellular functions. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) plays a key role in the balance of GSH by breaking down extracellular GSH. In this study, we proposed a novel strategy for sensitive and selective detection of GSH based on LC sensing platform coupled with its inhibition of γ-GT. The γ-GT cleavable surfactant, dodecyl N-ethanamide N, N, N-trimethylammonium bromide (DAA), was synthesized and utilized to decorate the aqueous/LC interface. A black optical image of LCs was observed due to formation of the self-assembled DAA monolayer at the interface. Subsequently, the optical response of LCs returned to bright appearance after transferring γ-GT to the DAA-laden interface because DAA could be enzymatically hydrolyzed by γ-GT and the monolayer was disrupted. Interestingly, LCs remained dark images after the DAA-decorated interface in contact with the pre-incubated GSH and γ-GT. The detection limit of GSH reached 1 pg/mL, which demonstrates high competitiveness with the current assays. The detection mechanism of GSH was explained by Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This work presents an appealing route to achieve ultrasensitive detection of GSH according to its hydrolysis by γ-GT and the as-prepared simple and robust LC-based sensing platform has potentials in the diagnosis of GSH-related diseases (e.g. cancer, liver damage, and malignant neoplasms). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

In this study, oncolytic adenovirus coding for human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) Ad5/3-E2F-d24-hTNF-α-IRES-hIL-2 (also known as [a.k.a.] TILT-123) provoked antitumor efficacy in tumors that were injected with Ad5/3-E2F-d24-hTNF-α-IRES-hIL-2 and those that were left non-injected in the same animal. Importantly, the virus was able to travel to distant tumors. To dissect the effects of oncolysis and cytokines, we studied replication-incompetent viruses in mice. Systemic antitumor effects were similar in both models, highlighting the importance of the arming device. The cytokines induced positive changes in immune cell infiltrates and induced the expression of several immune-reaction-related genes in tumors. In addition, Ad5/3-E2F-d24-hTNF-α-IRES-hIL-2 was able to increase homing of adoptively transferred tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes into both injected and non-injected tumors, possibly mediated through chemokine expression. In summary, local treatment with Ad5/3-E2F-d24-hTNF-α-IRES-hIL-2 resulted in systemic antitumor efficacy by inducing immune cell infiltration and trafficking into both treated and untreated tumors. Moreover, the oncolytic adenovirus platform had superior systemic effects over replication-deficient vector through spreading into distant tumors. © 2018 The Authors",

Here we report on the development, characterization and evaluation of a curcumin-loaded nanoemulsion (CUR-NEM) that is highly effective in preventing post-surgery tumor reincidence and metastasis. The method of fabrication utilized safe excipients and generated particles of 200 nm (PDI ≤ 0.2) with negative zeta potential (-30 mV) and a high yield of curcumin (95%), which can be converted by lyophilization to a dry powder. In vitro assays showed that CUR-NEM is safe in non-cancerous human cells (HEK-293T) and preferentially cytotoxic in gastric (AGS), colon (HT29-ATCC, HT29-US), breast (MDA-MB-231) and melanoma (B16F10) cells. In addition, in melanoma cells the nanoformulation increases intracellular curcumin accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, while preventing cell-migration and invasion. In vivo studies in C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that a single dose, applied topically to the wounded area after surgical excision of primary tumors formed upon subcutaneous injection of syngeneic B16F10 cells, was sufficient to completely prevent reincident tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis, while in untreated animals 70% reincidence and metastasis were observed. In vivo experiments also showed that the fluorescence signal due to curcumin was maintained at least 15 days after topical application of CUR-NEM, while when administered in DMSO the curcumin signal disappeared within 4 days. Importantly, the administration of a dose 22 times larger than that applied topically to animals after tumor surgery did not alter biochemical parameters. Due to the safety and efficacy of the formulation, we envisage it as ideal for topical application in cancer patients following surgery, to prevent tumor reincidence and metastasis. In addition, other routes of administration/protocols could also be proposed to treat/prevent malignant tumors in patients. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Incidence rates are an important population-level disease risk measure. Cancer incidence data in the United States, which are collected by disease registries, have been spatiotemporally sparse. Back-calculation methods can yield incidence estimates for a spatial domain by solving a convolution equation that relates mortality to incidence through survival estimates. We propose a novel back-calculation approach that uses spatiotemporal age-period-cohort (APC) modeling to estimate incidence for spatial units within a region. The method is applied to state-specific lung cancer data in the United States for males ages 30 to 84 in years 1975-2004. SEER data are used to model cancer progression from incidence to mortality along three timescales (APC) and across four regions. Using mortality data from National Vital Statistics System, incidence is back-calculated for unique birth cohorts in 49 states. A conditionally autoregressive model with cubic splines for temporal effects is used to smooth back-calculated estimates. Bayesian estimates of model parameters are obtained using integrated nested Laplace approximation. Results show varying time trends in lung cancer risk across states, which may quantify effects of state policies. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Recommendations for breast cancer screening using mammography target asymptomatic women aged ≥ 40 years who are not at increased risk for breast cancer. Evidence is not available to demonstrate benefits of screening with mammography at younger ages, and little is known about mammography use among younger women. This study described mammography use among women aged 18–39 years. Methods We analyzed data from the 2011–2015 National Survey of Family Growth, an in-person survey of a nationally representative sample of the U.S. household population. We estimated the prevalence of ever receiving a mammogram and examined reasons for the first mammograms among women aged 18–39 years without personal cancer history (n = 8324). We classified the first mammogram as a screening examination if it was performed either as part of a routine exam or because of family history of cancer. Results Among women aged 18–39 years, 14.3% (95% CI 13.2–15.4) reported ever having a mammogram. Prevalence of mammography use was highest among women aged 35–39 years (31.0%, 95% CI 27.8–34.5), and was higher among non-Hispanic black women than in other race/ethnicity groups. Women with a family history of breast cancer reported a higher prevalence of mammography use than women without this family history. For both women with and without a family history of breast cancer, about half of all first mammograms were performed for screening reasons. Conclusions Among U.S. women aged 18–39 years with no personal cancer history, one in seven reported having received a mammogram. Women with no family history of breast cancer were as likely as those with a family history to initiate breast cancer screening with mammography before age 40. Our findings provide evidence that supports further research to examine factors that prompt young women to receive screening mammograms. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Cellular senescence is a form of permanent cell cycle arrest that can be triggered by a variety of cell-intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, including telomere shortening, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation. Although the induction of apoptotic cell death is a desirable outcome in cancer therapy, mutations and/or deficiencies in the apoptotic signaling pathways have been frequently identified in many human cancer types, suggesting the importance of alternative apoptosis-independent therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. A growing body of evidence has documented that senescence induction in tumor cells is a frequent response to many anticancer modalities including cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 small molecule inhibitor-based targeted therapeutics and T helper-1 cytokine-mediated immunotherapy. This review discusses the recent advances and clinical relevance of therapy-induced senescence in cancer treatment. ©The Author(s) 2018. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

    "Abstract": "Background: There is a growing interest in delivering more personalised, risk-based breast cancer screening protocols. This requires population-level validation of practical models that can stratify women into breast cancer risk groups. Few studies have evaluated the Gail model (NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool) in a population screening setting; we validated this tool in a large, screened population. Methods: We used data from 40,158 women aged 50-69 years (via the lifepool cohort) participating in Australia's BreastScreen programme. We investigated the association between Gail scores and future invasive breast cancer, comparing observed and expected outcomes by Gail score ranked groups. We also used machine learning to rank Gail model input variables by importance and then assessed the incremental benefit in risk prediction obtained by adding variables in order of diminishing importance. Results: Over a median of 4.3 years, the Gail model predicted 612 invasive breast cancers compared with 564 observed cancers (expected/observed (E/O) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.18). There was good agreement across decile groups of Gail scores (χ 2 = 7.1, p = 0.6) although there was some overestimation of cancer risk in the top decile of our study group (E/O = 1.65, 95% CI 1.33-2.07). Women in the highest quintile (Q5) of Gail scores had a 2.28-fold increased risk of breast cancer (95% CI 1.73-3.02, p &lt; 0.0001) compared with the lowest quintile (Q1). Compared with the median quintile, women in Q5 had a 34% increased risk (95% CI 1.06-1.70, p = 0.014) and those in Q1 had a 41% reduced risk (95% CI 0.44-0.79, p &lt; 0.0001). Similar patterns were observed separately for women aged 50-59 and 60-69 years. The model's overall discrimination was modest (area under the curve (AUC) 0.59, 95% CI 0.56-0.61). A reduced Gail model excluding information on ethnicity and hyperplasia was comparable to the full Gail model in terms of correctly stratifying women into risk groups. Conclusions: This study confirms that the Gail model (or a reduced model excluding information on hyperplasia and ethnicity) can effectively stratify a screened population aged 50-69 years according to the risk of future invasive breast cancer. This information has the potential to enable more personalised, risk-based screening strategies that aim to improve the balance of the benefits and harms of screening. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Regulatory T cells (Treg) suppress cytotoxic T cell anti-tumoral immune responses and thereby promote tumor progression. Prevention of intratumoral Treg accumulation by inhibition of their migration to the tumor microenvironment is a promising therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to identify the role of the two major Treg-attracting chemokines CCL1 and CCL22 in human breast cancer. Methods: One hundred ninety-nine tissue samples of patients with invasive breast cancer were stained for CCL1 and CCL22 by immunohistochemistry. Chemokine expression and tumor infiltration by regulatory T cells, determined by expression of the transcription factor FoxP3, were quantified and their correlation to clinical features was statistically analyzed. Results: Both CCL1 and CCL22 were expressed in most breast cancer tissues. CCL1 was significantly over-expressed in invasive breast cancer as compared to normal breast tissue. CCL1, but surprisingly not CCL22, showed a significant correlation with the number of tumor-infiltrating FoxP3+ Treg (p< 0.001). High numbers of intratumoral CCL1 expressing cells were related to high grade tumors (G4) and a positive estrogen receptor (ER) status whereas high CCL22 expression was generally seen in lower grade tumors. The median survival of 88 patients with high intratumoral CCL1 expression was 37 months compared to 50 months for the 87 patients with low CCL1 levels, this trend was however not statistically significant. Conclusions: We found a high expression of CCL1 in human breast cancer. CCL1 significantly correlated with the infiltration of immunosuppressive FoxP3+ Treg, that are known to negatively affect survival. Thus, CCL1 may serve as prognostic marker and novel therapeutic target in breast cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AIM To investigate the therapeutic potential of two recombinant proteins, Survivin and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) fusion protein [LHRH(6leu)-LTB] for immunotherapy of breast cancer. METHODS Murine 4T-1 breast cancer model was used to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant proteins in vivo. Twenty four Balb/c mice were divided into 4 groups of 6 mice each. Recombinant Survivin and LHRH fusion protein, alone or in combination, were administered along with immunomodulator Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) in Balb/c mice. Unimmunized or control group mice were administered with phosphate buffer saline. Each group was then challenged with syngeneic 4T-1 cells to induce the growth of breast tumor. Tumor growth was monitored to evaluate the efficacy of immune-response in preventing the growth of cancer cells. RESULTS Preventive immunization with 20 µg recombinant Survivin and MIP was effective in suppressing growth of 4T-1 mouse model of breast cancer (P = 0.04) but 50 µg dose was ineffective in suppressing tumor growth. However, combination of Survivin and LHRH fusion protein was more effective in suppressing tumor growth (P = 0.02) as well as metastasis in vivo in comparison to LHRH fusion protein as vaccine antigen alone. CONCLUSION Recombinant Survivin and MIP suppress tumor growth significantly. Combining LHRH fusion protein with Survivin and MIP enhances tumor suppressive effects marginally which provides evidence for recombinant Survivin and LHRH fusion protein as candidates for translating the combination cancer immunotherapy approaches. ©The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The nucleotide changes in different genetic loci increased the incidence risk of breast cancer. AIM: The aim of present study was to investigate genotype distribution at codon 72 of the TP53 gene (rs1042522) in breast cancer patients to achieve a potential diagnostic marker related to some demographic feathers. METHODS: In our case-control study, blood samples were collected from a total of 34 patients harboured breast cancer. DNA was extracted, and nested-PCR was performed. Products were digested with AccII and subsequently were sequenced. Results were compared with samples characteristics. RESULTS: The PCR results indicated the correct implementation of extraction and amplification protocol. The genotypic distribution at codon 72 of TP53 in control group was 20%, 62.4% and 16.6% for Arg (wildtype), Arg/Pro (heterozygous) and Pro (homozygous variant) respectively. Also, this distribution in the patient group was 23.52% homozygous, 50% heterozygous, and 26.47% another homozygous variant (Adjusted odds ratio: 1.12 and 95%CI = 0.57 to 2.2, P = 0.03). The absence of Arg at codon 72 of TP53 is relevant with age higher than 40 years and metastasis to other organs. CONCLUSION: Polymorphism at codon 72 of TP53 was associated with high-grades of breast cancer risk and different responses to chemotherapy treatment. It is recommended genotype distribution of codon 72 of TP53 before chemotherapy. © 2018 Ali Arash Anoushirvani, Reza Aghabozorgi, Azam Ahmadi, Mohammad Arjomandzadegan, Maryam Sahraei, Sara Khalili, Taha Fereydouni, Zoha Khademi.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Sorafenib is an effective clinical drug in therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma, having led to improved prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. However acquired resistance is still being encountered. So, it is urgently to develop alternative strategies to overcome drug resistance. Exosomes can be modified with a variety of molecules, thereby acting as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic agents. The GRP78 is overexpressed in Sorafenib resistant cancer cells compared to Sorafenib sensitive cancer cells and thus is able to act as a target for therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: In this study, we modified BM-MSCs to express the exosomal siGRP78. And we show that siGRP78 modified exosomes combined with Sorafenib is able to target GRP78 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and inhibit the growth and invasion of the cancer cells in vitro. Further, siGRP78 modified exosomes combined with Sorafenib also inhibit the growth and metastasis of the cancer cells in vivo. Conclusions: siGRP78 modified exosomes could sensitize Sorafenib resistant cancer cells to Sorafenib and reverse the drug resistance. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "While thyroid nodules have relatively low incidence in children and adolescents, they are at high risk of malignancy. In addition, the clinical manifestations, biological behaviors, assessment methods, indications of fine-needle aspiration, and treatment principles also differ from those in adults. In the past, the assessment, treatment, and follow-up of thyroid nodules in children and adolescents follow the guidelines for adult patients, which are actually not applicable for children and adolescents in the real-world clinical settings. Based on the latest international guidelines on the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer, this article summarizes the clinical features, pathological characteristics, evaluation methods, treatments, and follow-up of thyroid cancer in children and adolescents. © 2018 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are proposed to be responsible for tumor metastasis, resistance and relapse after therapy, but are unable to be eliminated by many current therapies. Herein, we report that the apoferritin nanocages loading cytotoxic mertansine (M-AFN) can significantly improve their uptake in CSCs-enriched tumorspheres and effectively eradicate CSCs in tumorspheres for anticancer therapy. M-AFN were uniformly nanocage structures with the mean diameter of 11.26 ± 2.58 nm and the loading capacity of 0.62%. In the CSCs-enriched tumorsphere model, M-AFN could be preferentially internalized by tumorsphere cells and the average half-inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of M-AFN was obviously reduced by 5.46-fold when comparing to the parent 4T1 breast cancer cells. Moreover, both the already existing tumorspheres and the formation of secondary tumorspheres were drastically disrupted by M-AFN, but barely impacted by mertansine alone. The flow cytometer analysis showed the CSCs fractions in tumorspheres were considerably reduced by the M-AFN treatment. Therefore, the apoferritin nanocages represent an encouraging nanoplatform to eradicate CSCs for effective anticancer therapy. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Objective To verify the expressions of genes associated with colorectal cancer with hyperglycemia and evaluate their diagnostic values. Metliods Tumor tissues, distal normal intestinal mucosa, and peripheral blood samples were harvested from 109 colorectal cancer patients and peripheral blood samples from 30 diabetes patients and 30 healthy volunteers. The mRNA expressions of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), NADPH oxidase-1 (NOXl), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), and histone deacetylase 1 (HDACl) were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between the gene expressions and clinicopathological parameters in colorectal cancer patients were analyzed using Pearson ' s correlation analysis. Diagnostic test accuracy evaluation was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, predictability, Youden index, and likelihood ratio of serum gene expressions in colorectal cancer patients, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn. The area under the ROC curve was calculated to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of the combined detection of multiple genes. Results The mRNA levels of GRP78 (P = 0. 001), NOXl (P = 0. 022), CEACAM5 (P = 0. 000), HSP60 (P =0. 044), and HDACl (P = 0. 047) were positively correlated with the fasting blood glucose level. The mRNA expressions of NOXl (P = 0. 000, P = 0. 008) and HDACl (P = 0. 000, P = 0. 037) in tissues and serum were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients than in patients with normal blood glucose levels. The NOXl mRNA expression was positively correlated with the diameter of colorectal cancer (P=0. 013), and the HDACl mRNA expression was significantly correlated with the tumor site (P = 0. 049), depth of primary tumor invasion (P = 0. 025), and TNM stage (P = 0. 042). The areas under the ROC curves of NOXl, CEACAM5, and HDACl were 0. 931, 0. 852, and 0. 860 respectively (all P = 0. 000). The specificity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of NOXl, HDACl mRNA expression in colorectal cancer patients with hyperglycemia were all above 90%. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the combined detection of NOXl, CEACAM5, and HDACl were 98. 82% and 99.93%, respectively Conclusion Combined detection of genes associated with colorectal cancer accompanied by hyperglycemia can improve the diagnostic efficiency of early screening. © 2018 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Background: Autophagy plays a crucial role in sustaining the homeostasis in various malignant diseases. It has also been reported to promote tumor development in multiple cancers. Glutaminolysis instead of Warburg Effect produce adequate ATP and provide nitrogen and carbon to replenish the TCA cycle which has been discovered to be a new energy source for tumor cells recently. By means of degrading intracellular particles including amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, sugars and aged organisms, autophagy can recycle the aforementioned particles into bioenergetics and biosynthesis pathways, finally favoring tumor cells. MicroRNA is a kind of noncoding RNA that regulates the targeting gene expression mostly at post-transcription level. Among these miRNAs, microRNA-133a-3p is reported to be a tumor suppressor in numerous cancers. Methods: We characterized the down-regulated expression level of microRNA-133a-3p in gastric cancer via TCGA database. Subsequently, we verified the tumor suppressor role of microRNA-133a-3p in gastric cancer cells through a series biological function assay. We used immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscope to observe the negative effect of microRNA-133a-3p on autophagy and used dual-luciferase report assay to identify the candidate gene GABARAPL1 of microRNA-133A-3p.Then we used high performance liquid phase mass spectrometry and seahorse analysis to detect whether miR-133a-3p could block the glutaminolysis metabolism through autophagy. At last, we confirmed the tumor suppressor role of microRNA-133a-3p in vivo on PDX mice model. Results: We demonstrated that microRNA-133a-3p overexpression could block the activation of autophagy to ruin the abnormal glutaminolysis and further inhibit the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. We successfully proved gastric cancer cells can replenish glutaminolysis via autophagy and microRNA-133a-3p could block aforementioned pathway by targeting core autophagy participants GABARAPL1 and ATG13.We then verified the negative function of microRNA-133a-3p on autophagy-mediated glutaminolysis both in PDX model and human gastric cancer organoid model. Conclusions: MicroRNA-133a-3p targets GABARAPL1 to block autophagy-mediated glutaminolysis, further repressing gastric cancer growth and metastasis. © 2018 The Author(s).",
