    "Abstract": "Aims: To determine the variation in radiation therapy boost use in a nationwide study following adjustment of a national guideline in 2011, as well as to address the relationship to patient, tumour and radiation therapy institutional factors. Materials and methods: All invasive breast cancers and non-invasive breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ; DCIS) that received external whole-breast radiation between 2011 and 2016 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Box plots were used to evaluate variation over time and logistic regression was carried out to address other factors influencing the variation. Funnel plots were constructed, with unadjusted and adjusted data for patient and tumour factors significantly affecting the use of a boost. Results: For breast cancer patients (n = 45,207), the proportion receiving a boost and its range decreased over the years from 37.3–92.7% in 2011 to 28.3–65.4% in 2016. This trend was not observed in DCIS patients (n = 6,844). Young age, large tumours, high grade and the absence of tumour-free resection margins were associated with boost use for both breast cancer and DCIS. For breast cancer, triple-negative tumour subtype and metastatic lymph node involvement were also associated with boost use. Institutional factors did not influence the use of a boost and institutional variation remained substantial after case-mix adjustments. Conclusion: Following adjustment of a nationwide implemented guideline, variation in radiation therapy boost use decreased in patients with breast cancer but not in patients with DCIS. Several tumour and patient characteristics were associated with boost use. Substantial institutional variation could not be explained by differences in patient, tumour or predefined institutional characteristics. © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists",

    "Abstract": "In urothelial bladder cancer (UBC), risk stratification remains an important unmet need. Limitless self-renewal, governed by TERT expression and telomerase activation, is crucial for cancer progression. Thus, telomerase activation through the interplay of mutations (TERTpMut) and epigenetic alterations in the TERT promoter may provide further insight into UBC behavior. Here, we investigated the combined effect of TERTpMut and the TERT Hypermethylated Oncological Region (THOR) status on telomerase activation and patient outcome in a UBC international cohort (n = 237). We verified that TERTpMut were frequent (76.8%) and present in all stages and grades of UBC. Hypermethylation of THOR was associated with higher TERT expression and higher-risk disease in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC). TERTpMut alone predicted disease recurrence (HR: 3.18, 95%CI 1.84 to 5.51, p &lt; 0.0001) but not progression in NMIBC. Combined THORhigh/TERTpMut increased the risk of disease recurrence (HR 5.12, p &lt; 0.0001) and progression (HR 3.92, p = 0.025). Increased THOR hypermethylation doubled the risk of stage progression of both TERTpwt and TERTpMut NMIBC. These results highlight that both mechanisms are common and coexist in bladder cancer and while TERTpMut is an early event in bladder carcinogenesis THOR hypermethylation is a dynamic process that contributes to disease progression. While the absence of alterations comprises an extremely indolent phenotype, the combined genetic and epigenetic alterations of TERT bring additional prognostic value in NMIBC and provide a novel insight into telomere biology in cancer. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Visfatin levels have been reported to be abnormal in many types of cancers. However, epidemiological studies yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between circulating visfatin levels and cancer risk. A systematic search was conducted for relevant studies in health-related electronic databases up to March 2018. Data related to standard mean difference (SMD) and overall odds ratio (ORS) were collected and analyzed. Summary SMD and pooled OR with 95% CIs were calculated using a random-effect model. Funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test were conducted to examine the risk of publication bias. A total of 27 studies with 2,693 cases and 3,040 healthy controls were included in meta-analysis for pooling SMD analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed a significant higher visfatin levels in patients with various cancers than in controls, with a pooled SMD of 0.88, 95% CI = 0.56–1.20, p = 0.000. In subgroup, metaregression, Galbraith plot, and sensitivity analysis showed no substantial difference among all the analyzed factors. Data from 14 studies were also used for pooling ORs analysis. Metaresults revealed that high visfatin levels were associated with cancer risk (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.14–1.34, p = 0.000). No evidence of publication bias was observed for pooling ORs and SMD analysis. This meta-analysis indicated a significant association between high circulating visfatin levels and increased risk of various cancers. Visfatin may represent a potential biomarker for early detection of cancers who may benefit from preventive treatment.Note. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Nearly 40 000 women die annually from breast cancer in the United States. Clinically available targeted breast cancer therapy is largely ineffective in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by tumors that lack expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). TNBC is associated with a poor prognosis. Previous reports show that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) partial agonist 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-5-fluorobenzothiazole (5F 203) selectively inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells, including those of the TNBC subtype. We previously demonstrated that 5F 203 induced the expression of putative tumor suppressor gene cytoglobin (CYGB) in breast cancer cells. In the current study, we determined that 5F 203 induces apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells and in T47D ER + PR + Her2 − breast cancer cells. We also show that caspases and CYGB promote 5F 203–mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. 5F 203 induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cathepsin B release in MDA-MB-468 and T47D cells. In addition, silencing CYGB attenuated the ability of 5F 203 to induce caspase-3/-7 activation, proapoptotic gene expression, LMP, and cathepsin B release in MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, 5F 203 induced CYGB protein expression, proapoptotic protein expression, and caspase-3 cleavage in MDA-MB-468 cells and in MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors grown orthotopically in athymic mice. These data provide a basis for the development of AhR ligands with the potential to restore CYGB expression as a novel strategy to treat TNBC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: F3 is a novel fraction, for the first time isolated from Valeriana jatamansi Jones, which is a traditional Chinese folk medicine. Its anti-cancer potential and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been well elucidated. Purpose: This study aims to investigate the anti-cancer effects of F3 on human breast cancer cell lines and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: MTT assay was first performed to detect the effect of F3 on cell viability in human breast cancer cell lines and human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. Cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS level were detected by flow cytometry. Comet and immunofluorescence assays were utilized to assess DNA damage and expression of γ-H2AX. Autophagy were observed by AO staining and fluorescence microscopy. The expression of relative proteins was detected by western blotting. The xenograft model in nude mice was used to elucidate the effect of F3 on tumor growth and DNA damage in vivo. Results: F3 could significantly inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells in concentration-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis and has no obvious inhibitory effect of the growth on MCF-10A cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that F3-induced apoptosis was mediated by DNA damage as presented by DNA strand breaks and γ-H2AX activation that might be attacked by ROS accumulation. This triggered several key molecular events involving activation of MAPKs pathway. Further study showed that F3 induced autophagy with the autophagosome formation and increased LC3-II levels. Finally, in vivo study, F3 exhibited a potential antitumor effect and induced DNA damage in MDA-MB-231 xenografts. Conclusion: The antitumorigenic activity of F3 was found in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that F3 may be a potential natural active fraction for the treatment of human breast cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "IR780 is a near infrared (NIR) dye with a huge potential to be applied in cancer phototherapy and imaging. However, IR780 poor water solubility and acute cytotoxicity limit its direct use in cancer theragnostic. Herein, a novel Hyaluronic acid (HA)-based amphiphilic polymer was used, for the first time, in the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles (HPN) encapsulating IR780 aimed to be applied in breast cancer therapy. Furthermore, HPN co-encapsulating IR780 and Doxorubicin (DOX) were also produced in order to further enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of this nanoformulation. The results revealed that HPN were able to successfully encapsulate IR780 (IR-HPN) and the IR780-DOX combination (IR/DOX-HPN). Furthermore, the encapsulation of IR780 in HPN improved its absorption at 808 nm by about 2.2-fold, thereby enhancing its photothermal potential, as well as its cytocompatibility. The 2D in vitro cell uptake studies demonstrated that the nanostructures displayed a higher internalization by breast cancer cells than by normal cells. In addition, the assays performed in 3D in vitro models of breast cancer revealed that HPN can penetrate into spheroids. Furthermore, the 3D in vitro studies also demonstrated that the combined application of IR-HPN and NIR light was unable to induce cytotoxicity on spheroids. In contrast, IR/DOX-HPN produced a decrease on spheroids cells’ viability, and their combination with NIR light induced an even stronger therapeutic effect, thus revealing the potential of these nanoparticles for cancer chemo-phototherapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Origin, synthesis and activity of quinaldic acid (QA), proposed derivative of kynurenic acid, have been poorly studied to date. Previously, we have demonstrated the antiproliferative effect of QA in a colon cancer model in vitro. The goal of present study was to verify QA activity to modify the expression of p53 tumor suppressor in colon cancer cells, and to relate it to its cancer cell growth inhibiting activity in vitro. Methods: LS180 colon cancer cells possessing the wild type form of p53 were used in the study. Real-time PCR and immunobloting techniques were used to test the expression of p53 at gene and protein level, respectively. Next, immunocytochemistry was used to visualize the localization of p53 protein within the cells. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of QA was retested in cells with siRNA silenced P53 gene. Results: The activity of QA to modify both the expression and phosphorylation of p53 protein as well as the level of P53 gene is shown. Concomitantly, the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of phospho-p53 protein upon QA treatment is also presented. Moreover, reduced activity of QA in colon cancer cells with silenced p53 expression is observed. Conclusion: QA affects the expression of p53 tumor suppressor, both at gene and protein level. The prominent contribution of p53 to the antiproliferative effect of QA in LS180 colon cancer cells can be suggested. © 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a common cancer in humans. Although overexpression of eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF1Bα is associated with cancer onset and progression, little is known about its expression in GC and its prognostic significance. Here we used immunohistochemistry to analyze eEF1Bα expression in the following tissue types: GC, normal gastric, chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and intraepithelial neoplasia. These data were correlated with patients' clinical information. eEF1Bα was expressed at levels approximately three times higher in GC tissues compared with normal gastric tissues. High expression of eEF1Bα was significantly associated with histological type, TNM stage, tumor size, and distant metastases. GC patients with high eEF1Bα expression experienced significantly shorter overall survival. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that eEF1Bα may be associated with protein synthesis, energy metabolism, cell cycle, and the p53 signaling pathway. We identified the products of RPL10A and RPS13 as critical components of a network comprising eEF1Bα. We concluded that high eEF1Bα expression is associated with poor overall survival and may serve as an independent prognostic factor of GC. Further, we proposed that eEF1Bα likely mediates the development of GC through the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathway. Together, our findings suggest that eEF1Bα could be an effective prognostic biomarker for GC. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumors and the main reason for cancer-related death around the world, whereas nonsmall cell lung cancer that consists two subtypes: lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is responsible for an estimated 85% of all lung cancers. The current study aimed to explore gene expression and methylation differences between LUAD and LUSC. EdgeR was used to identify differentially regulated genes between normal and cancer in the LUAD and LUSC extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively, whereas SAM was used to find genes with differential methylation between normal and cancer in the LUAD and LUSC, respectively. Finally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the function which these genes enriched in. A total of 391 genes with opposite methylation patterns in LUAD and LUSC and four functional pathways were obtained (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1). These pathways mainly included fat digestion and absorption, phenylalanine metabolism, bile secretion, and so on, which were related to the airframe nutrition metabolic pathway. Moreover, two genes CTSE (cathepsin E) and solute carrier family 5 member 7 (SLC5A7) were also found, among which CTSE was overexpressed and hypomethylated in LUAD corresponding to normal lung tissues, whereas SLC5A7 showed the opposite in LUAD. In conclusion, this study investigated the differences between the gene expression and methylation patterns in LUAD and LUSC, and explored their different biological characteristics. Further understanding of these differences may promote the discovery and development of new, accurate strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Early cancer diagnosis is of prime importance as it paves the way for effective treatment and possible patient survival. The recent advancements in the field of biosensorics have facilitated the development of functionalized nanobiosensors which have the potential to provide a cost-effective, reliable and rapid diagnostic strategy for cancers. These nanoscaled sensing systems utilize electrochemical, optical, mass and calorimetric sensing mechanisms to specifically identify the disease-specific biomarkers. Because of clinical translational utility, the present review aims to describe the recent developments and status of the nanobiosensors as a point-of-care approach for cancer diagnosis. The review also offers important insights into the design, preparation and characterization of these nano-frameworks. In particular, the state-of-art nanobiosensors based on carbon nanostructures, metal nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, silica-based nanomaterials, conducting polymers based nanoparticles and quantum dots, which provide countless opportunities in the field of cancer biosensorics have been summarized. It also showcases the need to perform robust clinical validation of the emerging nanobiosensor strategies that would act as the ultimate point-of-care test for the personalized cancer therapeutics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Genetic alterations have been attributed to the abnormal immune microenvironment in cancer. However, the relationship between the KrasG12D mutation and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this study, we found that KrasG12D mutation status as determined by ddPCR correlated with high levels of Treg infiltration in resectable pancreatic cancer tissues. Compared to wild-type tumour cells, tumours cells with the KrasG12D mutation were associated with higher levels of Tregs, and knockout of the KrasG12D mutation reversed this effect. In addition, overexpression of the KrasG12D mutation in wild-type Kras tumour cells resulted in conversion of CD4+CD25− T cells into Tregs. We also found that in tumour cells, the KrasG12D mutation activated the MEK/ERK pathway, thereby up-regulating the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which induced Treg conversion. In summary, KrasG12D mutation plays a critical role in Treg conversion and contributes to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer. These results provide new insights into the relationship between gene mutation and immune escape. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic impact of the lymph node ratio (LNR) versus positive lymph node count (PLNC) in patients who had undergone resection for distal cholangiocarcinoma. Methods: We identified 448 patients with resected distal cholangiocarcinoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The X-Tile program was used to calculate the cutoff values for the LNR and PLNC that discriminate survival. The overall survival and cancer-specific survival rates were calculated. Relationships between clinicopathological factors and patient survival were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The optimal cutoff values for the LNR and PLNC were 0.45 and 3, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that tumor size, the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, T stage, the LNR and PLNC were significantly associated with prognosis (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the LNR, T stage, and tumor size were independent prognostic factors for cancer-specific and overall survival, whereas PLNC was not. In the subgroup of patients with positive lymph nodes, patients with an LNR of greater than 0.45 had significantly worse cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio, 2.418; 95% confidence interval, 1.588 to 3.682; P < 0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.149; 95% CI, 1.421 to 3.249; P < 0.001) than those with an LNR of 0.45 or less. Conclusions: The LNR was a better predictor of long-term prognosis than PLNC in patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Accounting for 26% of all new cancer cases worldwide, breast cancer remains the most common form of cancer in women. Although early breast cancer has a favourable long-term prognosis, roughly a third of patients suffer from a suboptimal aesthetic outcome despite breast conserving cancer treatment. Clinical-quality 3D modelling of the breast surface therefore assumes an increasingly important role in advancing treatment planning, prediction and evaluation of breast cosmesis. Yet, existing 3D torso scanners are expensive and either infrastructure-heavy or subject to motion artefacts. In this paper we employ a single consumer-grade RGBD camera with an ICP-based registration approach to jointly align all points from a sequence of depth images non-rigidly. Subtle body deformation due to postural sway and respiration is successfully mitigated leading to a higher geometric accuracy through regularised locally affine transformations. We present results from 6 clinical cases where our method compares well with the gold standard and outperforms a previous approach. We show that our method produces better reconstructions qualitatively by visual assessment and quantitatively by consistently obtaining lower landmark error scores and yielding more accurate breast volume estimates. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer. MicroRNAs have been reported to participate in the progression of various cancers. In previous studies, miR-301a-3p expression was shown to be upregulated in CRC tissues. However, the underlying mechanism of miR-301a-3p in CRC has not yet been elucidated. Herein, the level of miR-301a-3p was found to be significantly upregulated in CRC clinical tissues and cell lines (HT29 and SW620). In addition, overexpression of miR-301a-3p obviously promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis in CRC cells. Meanwhile, upregulated miR-301a-3p expression also enhanced the expressions of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9, while the expression of Bax-2 was decreased. Furthermore, deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1) and runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) were verified to be direct target genes of miR-301a-3p. Furthermore, overexpression of DLC-1 and RUNX3 revealed antitumor effects in CRC cell lines with the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and the induction of cell apoptosis. In addition, the expressions of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-3, MMP-2, and MMP-9 could be decreased after upregulating the expressions of DLC-1 and RUNX3, along with the upregulation of Bax-2. Moreover, overexpression of miR-301a-3p could promote the growth of xenograft tumors and liver metastasis in vivo, along with reducing the expressions of DLC-1 and RUNX3. Overall, miR-301a-3p might act as a tumor inducer in CRC cells through negatively regulating DLC-1 and RUNX3. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "YouTube is a social media platform with more than 1 billion users and >600 000 videos about prostate cancer. Two small studies examined the quality of prostate cancer videos on YouTube, but did not use validated instruments, examine user interactions, or characterize the spread of misinformation. We performed the largest, most comprehensive examination of prostate cancer information on YouTube to date, including the first 150 videos on screening and treatment. We used the validated DISCERN quality criteria for consumer health information and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool, and compared results for user engagement. The videos in our sample had up to 1.3 million views (average 45 223) and the overall quality of information was moderate. More videos described benefits (75%) than harms (53%), and only 50% promoted shared decision-making as recommended in current guidelines. Only 54% of the videos defined medical terms and few provided summaries or references. There was a significant negative correlation between scientific quality and viewer engagement (views/month p = 0.004; thumbs up/views p = 0.015). The comments section underneath some videos contained advertising and peer-to-peer medical advice. A total of 115 videos (77%) contained potentially misinformative and/or biased content within the video or comments section, with a total reach of >6 million viewers. Patient summary: Many popular YouTube videos about prostate cancer contained biased or poor-quality information. A greater number of views and thumbs up on YouTube does not mean that the information is trustworthy. Many of the top YouTube videos on prostate cancer contain biased or misinformative content. User engagement was higher for videos with a lower quality of information. Prostate cancer providers, researchers, and organizations should continue to create evidence-based content that is of interest to viewers to help balance what patients and their families access. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an intracellular protozoan parasite that often infects warm-blooded animals or causes opportunistic infections if exists a suppressed immunity. This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence of T. gondii and its odds ratio (OR) in patients with cancer in compared with healthy individuals, and to find the possible factors. Related literatures reported the seroprevalence of T. gondii in cancer/tumor patients and controls (health individuals) were retrieved from electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Web of Knowledge and The Cochrane Library from inception until Aug 31 2018. The non-weighted prevalence of T. gondii, pooled estimates of OR and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated through random-effect model. Between-study heterogeneity was tested with Cochrane Q, and statistic I 2 was to quantify the results. Funnel plot depiction and Egger's linear regression test were combined to evaluate the potential of publication bias. The literature identified a total of 2216 potential studies; the final 18 studies were incorporated, with 6001 cancer/tumor patients and 6067 controls. Our results demonstrated that, the cancer/tumor patients had an elevated seroprevalence of T. gondii (18.43% vs 8.19%), and an increased risk of T. gondii infection (OR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.65–3.82) when compared with the controls. Subgroup analyses suggested that publication year, study sample size and diagnostic options are closely associated with the seroprevalence of T. gondii. Overall, our study indicates that there is an increased risk of T. gondii infection in cancer/tumor patients, suggesting a precautionary monitoring of T. gondii and related risk factors in patients with cancer/tumor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Limonin has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, however, its roles in tumor progression remain unclear. This work aims to investigate the roles and related mechanism of limonin in the stemness of breast cancer cells. Here, we found that limonin attenuated the stemness of breast cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, evident by the decreasing the capacity of cell spheroid formation, expression of stemness markers and ALDH1 activity, whereas had no toxicity on non-tumorigenic cells. Additionally, limonin enhanced adriamycin sensitivity of breast cancer cells and attenuated adriamycin resistance in adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, limonin decreased MIR216A methylation level and thus increased miR-216a-3p expression. Furthermore, miR-216a-3p could directly bind to WNT3A and thus inactivated Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Therefore, our results indicate that limonin could attenuate the stemness and chemoresistance via inhibiting MIR216A methylation and subsequently suppressing Wnt/β-catenin pathway. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of the current study was to investigate if and to what extent depression and emotional regulation strategies (namely, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) might lead to parenting stress in a sample of mothers with cancer and in a sample of healthy mothers. Methods: A sample of mothers with cancer (clinical group; n = 64) and a sample of healthy mothers (control group; n = 80) were administered self-report questionnaires investigating parenting stress (the parenting stress index), depressive symptoms (the Zung depression self-rating scale) and emotion regulation strategies (the emotion regulation questionnaire). Results: Depressive levels represented the most significant predictor of maternal parenting stress in both groups (p <.001). In addition, cognitive reappraisal (p <.05) but not expressive suppression significantly predicted parenting stress exclusively in the group of mothers with cancer. Finally, cognitive reappraisal was negatively and significantly associated with time since cancer diagnosis to survey. Conclusions: This study highlights that depressive levels and cognitive reappraisal may play a significant role in parenting stress. The systematic assessment of these variables in women with an oncological diagnosis might help mental health professionals to identify those mothers at risk of developing higher levels of parenting stress ensuring adequate support and preventing negative effects on the parent–child relationship. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Approximately 29 000 men die of prostate cancer (PCa) each year in the United States, and 90% to 100% of them are due to incurable bone metastasis. It is difficult to determine (1) when PCa disseminates in the natural history of the disease; (2) where cancer cell disseminates before becoming overt metastatic lesions; and (3) which tumors are aggressive and which are indolent. Tumor tissue and liquid (blood and bone marrow) biopsies provide important information to answer these questions, but significant limitations exist for immunostaining strategies that assess protein expression in these tissues. Classic immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays can typically assess expression of one or two proteins per tissue section. We have developed a novel immunofluorescence staining protocol to detect a panel of seven proteins on PCa tissue from primary tumor biopsies and metastatic lesion autopsy tissue, as well as cancer cells from liquid biopsies. We used a tyramide-based system to amplify the true signal and optimized the protocol to reduce background signal, thereby boosting the signal-to-noise ratio. Any protein-specific antibody in this protocol can be exchanged for a different validated antibody. This protocol therefore, represents a highly informative and flexible assay that can be used to provide important information about cancer tissue for the purpose of improving detection, diagnosis, and treatment. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is indicated to improve glycaemic control in adults of type 2 diabetes. In nonclinical studies, dapagliflozin was neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. However, in some clinical studies, an increased incidence of bladder cancer was observed in the dapagliflozin group vs. the placebo. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine if dapagliflozin can act as a promoter in a 2-stage bladder cancer model in rats induced with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN). Rats given BBN (100 or 400 mg/kg, po) twice weekly for 6 weeks in Phase 1 were assigned in Phase 2 to receive daily dose of vehicle, dapagliflozin (0.5 mg/kg, po) or uracil (positive control, 3% in diet) from weeks 8–34. All bladders were evaluated by histopathology. Verifying the validity of the model, uracil increased the incidence of bladder cancer, while dapagliflozin had no effect on the incidence or invasiveness of transitional cell carcinoma. The exposure of dapagliflozin at 0.5 mg/kg/day in rats was 7 times the clinical exposure at maximal therapeutic dose (10 mg). In conclusion, dapagliflozin does not act as promoter or progressor of bladder cancer in a validated bladder cancer model in rats. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Although there has been increasing emphasis on the importance of spirituality in patients with cancer, few studies have examined the spiritual experiences of an ethnically diverse sample of Asian women with breast cancer. The objective of this study was to examine the spiritual experiences of Singaporean women with breast cancer in the first year of diagnosis. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study design was used and data were gathered using individual semi-structured interviews. Purposive sampling selected the participants and data saturation sample size was reached after interviews with 28 participants. Data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic approach. Results: The participants were aged between 28 and 64 years and included women from the three major ethnic groups. The three themes that emerged from the data included transcendental experiences, meaning and purpose, and changing perspectives. Conclusions: This study informs that while spiritual needs are common, Singaporean women in their first year of the breast cancer diagnosis express spirituality in culturally specific ways. The clinical implications of the study emphasize the importance of addressing women's spiritual concerns, with attention to cultural differences so as to render holistic patient-centered care. © 2018 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co.

    "Abstract": "Recent studies reported the involvement of JAK2/STAT3 pathway in various solid tumours including breast, ovarian, prostate and lung cancers. Clinical literature also reported the lowered burden in breast and ovarian cancers by targeting JAK2 pathway. In this study, a series of novel 2,4-disubstituted quinazolines (2a-2 j and 3a-3 j) were synthesized and were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and ovarian cancer (SK-O-V3) cell lines using MTT assay. Moderate to good in vitro cytotoxic potentials of the newly synthesized molecules were reported against selected human cancer cell lines. Among the tested molecules, compound 3b has shown better cytotoxic activity against MD-MB-231 (10.1 ± 0.51 μM). in vitro JAK2 inhibition assay elucidated the mechanistic profile of the derivatives with moderate percentage of inhibition. Compounds 3b and 3d were reported with 35.4% and 34.2% inhibition of JAK2 protein. SAR studies suggest that the larger hydrophobic aromatic nucleus with hydrophilic linkage could probably increase the cytotoxic and JAK2 potentials and hydroxyl or nitro substitution could be more beneficial. Molecular dynamics simulation studies with JAK2-3b, and JAK2-3d complexes elucidated the conformational changes. With the reported bioactivities of these derivatives, further studies on the derivatization could elucidate the broader cytotoxic potentials. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Bone metastasis is a major cause of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality. Although docetaxel chemotherapy initially extends patients’ survival, in most cases PCa becomes chemoresistant and eventually progresses without a cure. In this study, we developed a novel small-molecule compound BKM1972, which exhibited potent in vitro cytotoxicity in PCa and other cancer cells regardless of their differences in chemo-responsiveness. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that BKM1972 effectively inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic protein survivin and membrane-bound efflux pump ATP binding cassette B 1 (ABCB1, p-glycoprotein), presumably via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). BKM1972 was well tolerated in mice and as a monotherapy, significantly inhibited the intraosseous growth of chemosensitive and chemoresistant PCa cells. These results indicate that BKM1972 is a promising small-molecule lead to treat PCa bone metastasis and overcome docetaxel resistance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in women with unsatisfactory survival rates. Advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of BC provide the opportunity to develop gene-based medicines capable of treating metastatic diseases. Here, we first demonstrated efficient tissue engineering approaches applied to normal breast and BC extracellular matrix (ECM) starting from decellularized human biopsies to generate a three-dimensional (3D) bioactive model with the sodium lauryl ether sulfate solution. The decellularized tissues maximized the genetic component removal from tissues and minimally injured ECM structures and native compositions by histology and ECM compositions analyses. Importantly, we proved that the 3D ECM retained tissues biological properties. We demonstrated that after 30 days of recellularization with MCF-7 cell (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), the 3D cancer ECM induced an overexpression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer proliferation. Meanwhile, normal ECM from the breast inhibited EMT and cell growth with the inducement of apoptosis. Given the biological activity preserved in the ECM after decellularization, we believe these approaches are powerful tools for future preclinical research for BC and breast development. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Thyroid cancer is a common endocrine malignancy whose incidence has increased in recent years. Several internal and external risk factors are involved in the development of this cancer, such as infectious agents. Evidence supporting the role of viral infection as an etiology for the invasiveness of thyroid cancer is increasing. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and the association between viral gene products and thyroid tumor development. Methods: Fifty-seven thyroid cancer specimens were collected from the same number of patients as well as 18 samples from healthy controls. The presence of the EBV genome and the genotyping was examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Also, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time PCR were used to measure the expression levels of viral and cellular genes. Results: The EBV DNA was detected in 71.9% of the samples, and it was also found that the presence of the EBV was associated with increasing development of thyroid tumor. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that EBV infection may play a role in the development of thyroid tumor. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Alkaline phosphatase placental-like 2 (ALPPL2) is a member of the ALPP alkaline phosphatase family and is reported to be associated with the growth of some tumors. Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. We previously identified a distinct expression pattern of ALPPL2 between gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues. In this study, we examined the expression of ALPPL2 in gastric adenocarcinoma and its ability to predict prognosis. We used bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry to examine the expression pattern of ALPPL2 and analyzed the associations between ALPPL2 level and perioperative characteristics and the prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma patients by Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis. Our results indicated that the expression of ALPPL2 was significantly increased in gastric adenocarcinoma (P <.01) and was an independent factor (P <.05) that could provide reliable prognostic information on gastric adenocarcinoma patients. High expression of ALPPL2 was associated with advanced TNM stage (P <.05) and high HER-2 expression (P <.01). Our study suggests that ALPPL2 has the potential to reveal prognostic information on gastric cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Due to the traditional therapies of cancer inducing huge pains to patients, the non-invasive photo-guided therapies are attracting massive attentions of researchers. Herein, the intelligent-designed carbon-dots/hemin nanoplatforms (HCDs NPs) were developed, owning high-authority photo-therapy for cancer. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect enhanced the photo-thermal ability of HCDs NPs, endowing the synthesized nanoplatforms with photo-dynamic property simultaneously. Therefore, the obtained HCDs NPs could achieve synergetic photo-thermal and photo-dynamic therapies for cancer. Basing on the experimental results, the prepared HCDs NPs could induce the temperature enhancement high to ca 26 °C under laser irradiation, also with the outstanding photo-dynamic efficacy. More than 90% of cancer cells die after 10 min laser treatment. Thus, the dual-modal photo-therapeutic HCDs NPs are promising and excellent nanomaterials for potential application in synergistic cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Quantum-mediated effects have been observed in biological systems. We have previously discussed basis-dependent quantum selection as a mechanism for directed adaptive mutation, a process in which selective pressure specifically induces mutation in those genes involved in the adaptive response. Tumor progression in cancer easily lends itself to the adaptive evolutionary perspective, as the Darwinian combination of heritable variations together with selection of the better proliferating variants are believed to play a major role in multistep carcinogenesis. Adaptive mutation may play a role in carcinogenesis; accordingly, we propose that the principles of quantum biology are involved in directed adaptive mutation processes that promote tumor formation. In this paper, we discuss the intersection between quantum mechanics, biology, adaptive evolution, and cancer, and present general models by which adaptive mutation may influence neoplastic initiation and progression. As a potential theoretical and experimental model, we use colorectal cancer. Our model of “quantum cancer” suggests experiments to evaluate directed adaptive mutation in tumorigenesis, and may have important implications for cancer therapeutics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is a highly incident malignant cancer among men. Early detection of prostate cancer is necessary for deciding whether a patient should receive costly and invasive biopsy with possible serious complications. However, existing cancer diagnosis methods based on data mining only focus on diagnostic accuracy, while neglecting the interpretability of the diagnosis model that is necessary for helping doctors make clinical decisions. To take both accuracy and interpretability into consideration, we propose a stacking-based ensemble learning method that simultaneously constructs the diagnostic model and extracts interpretable diagnostic rules. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is devised to maximize the classification accuracy and minimize the ensemble complexity for model selection. As for model combination, a random forest classifier-based stacking technique is explored for the integration of base learners, i.e., decision trees. Empirical results on real-world data from the General Hospital of PLA demonstrate that the classification performance of the proposed method outperforms that of several state-of-the-art methods in terms of the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the results reveal that several diagnostic rules extracted from the constructed ensemble learning model are accurate and interpretable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cucurbitacin B (CuB) is a natural tetracyclic triterpene product that displays antitumor activity against a wide variety of cancers. In this study, we explored the antipancreatic cancer activity of CuB via the inhibition of expression of the cancer-related long noncoding RNA, actin filament-associated protein 1-antisense RNA 1 (AFAP1-AS1). CuB arrested pancreatic cancer (PC) cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase by suppressing the expression of AFAP1-AS1. Insights into the mechanisms of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) gained from bioinformatics analysis and luciferase activity assays showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and AFAP1-AS1 directly compete for miR-146b-5p binding. CuB-induced high miR-146b-5p expression and inhibited the expression of AFAP1-AS1. In summary, reducing the expression of endogenous AFAP1-AS1 effectively increased the available concentration of miR-146b-5p in PC, whereas miR-146b-5p overexpression prevented the expression of endogenous AFAP1-AS1. In particular, we hypothesized that AFAP1-AS1 might act as a ceRNA, effectively becoming a sponge for miR-146b-5p, thereby activating the expression of the EGFR. Thus, CuB suppresses the proliferation, in vitro and in vivo, of PC cells through the ceRNA effect of AFAP1-AS1 on miR-146b-5p. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: There are no guidelines on clinical target volume (CTV) delineation for cT2 rectal cancer treated with organ preservation. Materials and methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the extent of distal mesorectal (DMS) and distal intramural spread (DIS), the risk of lateral lymph node (LLN) metastases in pT2 tumours, and regional recurrence pattern after organ preservation. Results: The rate of DMS > 1 cm was 1.9% (95% CI: 0.4–5.4%), maximum extent: 1.3 cm. The rate of DIS > 0.5 cm was 4.7% (95% CI: 1.3–11.5%), maximum extent: 0.8 cm. The rate of LLN metastases was 8.2% (95% CI: 6.7–9.9%) for tumours below or at peritoneal reflexion and 0% for higher tumours. Regional nodal recurrences alone were recorded in 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5–1.7%) of patients after watch-and-wait and in 2.1% (95% CI: 1.2–3.4%) after preoperative radiotherapy and local excision. Thus, the following rules for CTV delineation are proposed: caudal border 1.5 cm from the tumour to account for DMS or 1 cm to account for DIS, whichever is more caudal; cranial border at S2/S3 interspace; inclusion of LLN for tumours at or below peritoneal reflexion. A planning study was performed in eight patients to compare dose–volume parameters obtained using these rules to that obtained using current guidelines for advanced cancers. The proposed rules led to a mean 18% relative reduction of planning target volume, which resulted in better sparing of organs-at-risk. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests a smaller CTV for cT2 tumours than the current guidelines designed for advanced cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: In locally advanced esophageal cancer, the optimal dose constraints for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) have yet to be established. This study is carried out to identify the most reliable dosimetric predictors for pulmonary complications following NACRT and surgery for esophageal cancer. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 308 patients with esophageal cancer who received surgery following NACRT for locally advanced esophageal cancer from January 2005 to June 2017. Dose–volume histograms (DVH) of both lungs were computed for each patient along with total lung volume, mean lung dose (MLD), V 5 , V 10 , V 20 , and V 30 . The effect of each parameter on postoperative pulmonary complications was estimated in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 22.1% of all patients. Univariate analysis for pulmonary complications showed that location of tumor (P = 0.017), pre-RT FEV1 (P = 0.003), MLD (P = 0.002), V 5 (P &lt; 0.001), V 10 (P &lt; 0.001), and V 20 (P = 0.007) were all significant risk factors. Significant factors for postoperative pulmonary complications in multivariate analysis were MLD (odds ratio (OR) 1.118, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.025–1.219, P = 0.012) and pre-RT FEV1 (OR 0.483, 95% CI 0.294–0.795, P = 0.004). Conclusions: In patients who received NACRT and surgery for esophageal cancer, MLD was the parameter most related to postoperative pulmonary complications. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal DVH constraints for NACRT in order to minimize the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in esophageal cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To examine the association between occupational exposure to petroleum-based and oxygenated solvents and the risk of oral and oropharyngeal cancer. Methods: The ICARE study is a large population-based case-control study conducted in France between 2001 and 2007. This present analysis was restricted to men and included 350 and 543 cases of squamous cell-carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx, respectively, and 2780 controls. Lifetime tobacco, alcohol consumption and complete occupational history were assessed through detailed questionnaires. Job-exposure matrices allowed us to assess occupational exposure to five petroleum-based solvents (white spirits; diesel/fuel oils/kerosene; gasoline; benzene; special petroleum products) and five oxygenated solvents (diethyl ether; tetrahydrofuran; ketones and esters; alcohols; ethylene glycol). Odds-ratios (ORs), adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol consumption and socioeconomic status, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic models. Results: Associations between oral cancer risk and exposure to white spirits and diesel/fuel oils/kerosene were suggested, but there was no exposure-response trend. Concerning exposure to oxygenated solvents, participants with the highest levels of cumulative exposure to diethyl ether had a significant excess risk of oropharyngeal cancer (OR = 7.78, 95%CI 1.42 to 42.59; p for trend = 0.04). Ever exposure to tetrahydrofuran was associated with a borderline significant increased risk of oral cancer (OR = 1.87, 95%CI 0.97 to 3.61), but no exposure-response trend was observed. Additional adjustments for exposure to other solvents did not substantially change the results. Conclusion: Our results do not provide evidence for a major role of petroleum-based and oxygenated solvents in the occurrence of oral and oropharyngeal cancers in men. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Nanosized carbonaceous materials are favorable in biomedicine applications including photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer. Since conventional strategies of cancer treatment have not responded to this serious disease, development of efficient alternative and promising strategies is highly desirable. In this study, carbon xerogel nanoparticles (CX-NPs) were synthesized as a novel photothermal nanomaterial and activated upon laser light of 808-nm wavelength for cancer phototherapy application. The synthesized CX-NPs had a spherical shape with a size of about 16 nm that showed nice photothermal conversion ability. Upon light irradiation with a power density of 1.0 W cm −2 for 15 min, a temperature increment occurred. A concentration-dependent cytotoxicity was also obtained for CX-NPs toward the C540 (B16/F10) cell line upon light irradiation, while CX-NPs presented biocompatibility in the mice model in dark. Photothermal property of CX-NPs efficiently led to reduction in the cell viability. A low-dose of CX-NPs was also applied in PTT of a melanoma tumor-bearing animal model. Based on tumor histopathological evaluations and volume change measurements in mice, a very good control of tumor situations after PTT by CX-NPs was attained. The findings revealed that CX-NPs is a good and novel photoabsorber for PTT of cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Weight loss is a multifactorial condition that commonly affects patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. The aims of this study were to 1) describe body weight changes over time in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancers and 2) explore the influence of pretreatment weight loss, body mass index (BMI) category, symptom burden, mucositis, and nutritional support on body weight changes over time. Methods: Using a longitudinal design, this study investigated a consecutive cohort of head and neck cancer patients who were treated with radiotherapy between January 2015 to January 2016 in a Taiwan medical center (n = 128). Data regarding symptom burden, mucositis severity, and body weight were collected before radiotherapy (T1), one month after the initial radiotherapy (T2), at the completion of radiotherapy (T3), and one month after the completion of radiotherapy (T4). Results: On average, the participants’ body weight decreased by 3.09 kg (SD = 2.79) from T1 to T2, 1.72 kg (SD = 2.06) from T2 to T3, and continued to decrease by 1.04 kg (SD = 2.87) from T3 to T4. The results of a generalized estimating equation showed that BMI category, symptom burden, mucositis, and nutritional support were directly and independently related to body weight changes over time in patients with head and neck cancers. Conclusions: Head and neck cancer patients experience significant weight loss during and after radiotherapy. The study findings are relevant for assessing nutritional status and providing necessary support measures at critical moments for patients treated with radiotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Use of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) has been suggested to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. We conducted a nested case–control study using Danish demographic and health data registries and summarized existing evidence in a meta-analysis. The case–control study included all Danish men aged 40–85 years with incident histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma between 2005 and 2015 (cases). For each case, we selected 10 age–matched controls. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prostate cancer associated with long–term VKA use adjusted for concomitant drug use, medical history and socioeconomic status. Among 38,832 prostate cancer cases, 1,089 (2.8%) had used VKAs for 3 or more years compared to 10,803 (2.8%) controls yielding a crude OR of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.95–1.08). Multivariable adjustment for covariates had limited influence on the association (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.97–1.10). We observed no dose–response relationship (e.g. OR for 5–10 years of use, 1.06 95% CI, 0.97–1.16). We included 8 studies in the meta–analysis reporting effect estimates from 0.51 (95% CI, 0.23–1.13) to 1.10 (95% CI, 0.94–1.40). Using random effect methods, a pooled effect estimate of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.70–1.05) was obtained; however, there was considerable across–study heterogeneity (I2: 93.9%). In conclusion, we did not observe a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with VKA use in this nationwide study and, taken together with previous study findings, a major protective effect of VKAs against prostate cancer seems unlikely. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "The biological characteristics of bladder cancer include enhanced invasion and migration, which are the main causes of death in patients. Starvation is a typical feature of the bladder cancer microenvironment and can induce autophagy. Autophagy has an important relationship with the invasion and migration of tumors. However, the role of autophagy in the invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells remains unclear. Hence, the aim of the current study was to clarify this role and underlying mechanism. In this study, we found that starvation enhanced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated invasion and migration of T24 and 5637 cells while inducing autophagy. The inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) or 3-methyladenine (3MA) decreased EMT-mediated invasion and migration. In addition, the expression of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-β1) and phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) increased after starvation. The inhibition of autophagy with CQ or 3MA also decreased the expression of TGF-β1 and p-Smad3. The inhibitor of TGF-β receptor sb431542 also inhibited the invasion, migration, and EMT of T24 and 5637 cells during starvation. Furthermore, recombinant TGF-β1 induced autophagy and inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway with sb431542 suppressed autophagy. In summary, our results suggested that autophagy promotes the invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells by inducing EMT through the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. Moreover, autophagy and TGF-β1 can form a positive feedback loop to synergistically promote invasion and migration. Thus, our findings may provide a theoretical basis for the prevention of invasion and migration in bladder cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: This 14-month study aimed to examine the changes of quality of life following breast cancer surgery and associations of such changes with depression and anxiety levels, and protective factors (attachment styles in close relationship, and meaning in life) based on positive psychology theory. Materials and methods: Women with breast cancer were recruited within one week of completion of breast cancer surgery. They were asked to complete several questionnaires to measure the generic and breast cancer specific quality of life, depression and anxiety levels, attachment styles in close relationship, and meaning in life. Assessments were performed at baseline (T0), T1 (the 2nd month), T2 (the 5th month), T3 (the 8th month), and T4 (the 14th month). Results: While the generic functions of quality of life improve after surgery, no significant changes of the breast-specific functions were found during the 14-month follow up period. While physical, role, and social functions improved immediately after surgery, the improvements of emotional and cognitive functions began to occur at the 5th and the 8th months after surgery. Depressive symptoms predicted almost all general and breast-specific QOL functions and symptoms. Avoidant and anxious attachment styles were associated with the negative scores for breast-specific functions and symptoms. Conclusion: Breast-specific functions, in particular body image and sexual function, remain unchanged with the passage of time following surgery. A psychological rehabilitation program aiming to reduce depressive symptoms and enhance secure attachment styles in close relationships needs to be established immediately following surgery and continue through the post-treatment survivorship stages. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Computational quantum chemical study and biological evaluation of a synthesized novel sulfur heterocyclic thiophene derivative containing 1,2,3-triazole and pyridine moieties namely BTPT [2-(1-benzyl-5-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-6-methoxy-4-(thiophen-2-yl) pyridine] was presented in this study. The crystal structure was determined by SCXRD method. For the title compound BTPT, spectroscopic characterization like 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, FTIR, UV–vis were carried out theoretically by computational DFT method and compared with experimental data. Druglikeness parameters of BTPT were found through in silico pharmacological ADMET properties estimation. The molecular docking investigation was performed with human topoisomerase IIα (PDB ID:1ZXM) targeting ATP binding site. In vitro cytotoxicity activity of BTPT/doxorubicin were examined by MTT assay procedure against three human cancer cell lines A549, PC-3, MDAMB-231 with IC50 values of 0.68/0.70, 1.03/0.77 and 0.88/0.98 μM, respectively. Our title compound BTPT reveals notable cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell (MDAMB-231), moderate activity with human lung cancer cell (A-549) and less inhibition with human prostate cancer cell (PC-3) compared to familiar cancer medicine doxorubicin. From the results, BTPT could be observed as a potential candidate for novel anticancer drug development process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Natural products are a major source of potential anticancer agents, and in order to develop improved and more effective cancer treatments, there is an immense need in exploring and elucidating their mechanism of action. Sanguinarine (SNG), a quaternary benzophenanthridine alkaloid, has been shown to induce cytotoxicity in various human cancers and suppresses various pro-tumorigenic processes such as invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in different cancers. Lack of understanding the anticancer mechanism(s) of SNG has impeded the development of this molecule as a potential anticancer agent. Earlier, we have reported that SNG induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ceramide (Cer) generation and Akt dephosphorylation, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human leukemic cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that SNG has potent anti-proliferative activity against prostate cancer cells. Our data suggest that SNG induces Cer generation via inhibiting acid ceramidase and glucosylceramide synthase, two important enzymes involved in Cer metabolism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SNG induces ROS-depended extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, and prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) cleavage, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Overall, our findings provide molecular insight into the role of ROS signaling in the anticancer mechanism(s) of SNG. This may provide the basis for its use as a nontoxic and an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The cytotoxicity of monomyristin (MM), a monoacylglycerol, was investigated against cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and two normal cells (Vero and endometrial epithelial cells). MM exhibited cytotoxicity specifically to HeLa cells and not against normal cells except at the highest investigated doses (> 500 μg/mL). MM was showed to increase apoptotic dead cells by intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. To overcome the poor water solubility of MM and increase its efficacy against HeLa cells, MM was encapsulated into dextran-covered polylactide (PLA) nanoparticles (NPs). NPs comprised a PLA core which encapsulated MM and a superficial layer of dextran loops which was used for conjugating a protein, transferrin (Tf), known to be overexpressed on cancer cells’ surface. Encapsulation of MM into NPs increased its cytotoxicity against HeLa cells at lower doses of MM than free MM. Additionally, the presence of conjugated Tf further increased the cytotoxicity of MM against HeLa cells as compared to non-conjugated NPs. Remarkably, both conjugated and non-conjugated MM loaded NPs were safe to normal cells (Vero and endometrial). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Though the current therapies are effective at clearing an early stage prostate cancer, they often fail to treat late-stage metastatic disease. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of a natural triterpenoid, ganoderic acid DM (GA-DM), on two human prostate cancer cell lines: the androgen-independent prostate carcinoma (PC-3), and androgen-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma (LNCaP). Cell viability assay showed that GA-DM was relatively more toxic to LNCaP cells than to PC-3 cells (IC 50 s ranged 45-55 µM for PC-3, and 20-25 µM for LNCaP), which may have occurred due to differential expression of p53. Hoechst DNA staining confirmed detectable nuclear fragmentation in both cell lines irrespective of the p53 status. GA-DM treatment decreased Bcl-2 proteins while it upregulated apoptotic Bax and autophagic Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC-3 molecules, and caused an induction of both early and late events of apoptotic cell death. Biochemical analyses of GA-DM-treated prostate cancer cells demonstrated that caspase-3 cleavage was notable in GA-DM-treated PC-3 cells. Interestingly, GA-DM treatment altered cell cycle progression in the S phase with a significant growth arrest in the G2 checkpoint and enhanced CD4 + T cell recognition of prostate tumor cells. Mechanistic study of GA-DM-treated prostate cancer cells further demonstrated that calpain activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress contributed to cell death. These findings suggest that GA-DM is a candidate for future drug design for prostate cancer as it activates multiple pathways of cell death and immune recognition. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Many efforts have focused on the cancer stem cell (CSC) targeting nano delivery system, however, the anticancer therapy efficacy is relative low due to the highly drug-resistance and drug efflux. Nucleus-targeted drug delivery is a promising strategy for reverse the drug resistance and drug efflux of CSCs, but in vivo nucleus-targeted drug delivery has been challenging. Herein, we designed a mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based nucleus-targeted system, which could directly target the CSCs and further enter the nucleus by the surface modification of anti-CD133 and thermal-triggered exposure of TAT peptides under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The nucleus-targeted drug release ultimately leads to an exhaustive apoptosis of the CSCs through combined thermotherapy and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy. In vivo, the nucleus-targeted nano delivery system efficiently inhibits the tumor growth without notable side effects during the course of treatment. Molecular mechanism study illustrates that the system effectively eliminates the CSCs by blocking the hypoxia signaling pathway. This designed nucleus-targeted nano delivery system is expected to provide new insights for developing efficient platforms for CSC-targeted cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Transcription factor high-mobility group box-containing protein 1 (HBP1) may function as a tumor suppressor in various types of cancer. In a previous study, we demonstrated that HBP1 suppressed cell invasion in oral cancer. To further understand the underlying mechanism, the current study is aimed at investigating how HBP1 exerts its antimetastatic potential in oral cancer. In a cell model, ectopic expression of HBP1 potently suppressed epithelial–mesenchymal transition, cellular migration, and invasion; conversely, HBP1 knockdown promoted these malignant phenotypes. The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family is highly implicated in tumor metastasis. Therefore, we examined the effect of HBP1 on the activation of the MMP members, MMP-2, -9, and -13 that are highly associated with the aggressiveness of oral cancer. Ectopic expression of HBP1 resulted in a mild reduction in the expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9, yet it had a potent inhibitory effect on MMP-13. In contrast, HBP1 knockdown strongly enhanced the activation of MMP-13. Further, we demonstrated that MMP-13 is a target of HBP1 transcription repression as evidenced by the identification of an HBP1 binding site in the cis proximal region of the MMP-13 promoter. More important, MMP-13 knockdown significantly alleviated HBP1 small interfering RNA-mediated promotion in cell invasion. Analysis of oral tumor specimens revealed that the low HBP1 (<0.3-fold)/high MMP-13 (>3-fold) status was associated with metastatic potential. All told, our study provides evidence supporting the idea that the HBP1–MMP-13 axis is a key regulator of the aggressiveness in oral cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women after nonmelanoma skin cancer. Use of mammography, the main method to diagnose the disease, has several limitations in parts of the population. The primary goal of this work was to detect and localize the geometric centers of mammary tumors using only superficial temperatures of the breast skin. The 2D anatomic geometry of the breast was simulated using the commercial software COMSOL to obtain the distribution of skin temperature in the three main types of breast cancer. Random errors of ± 2% were added to the simulated temperatures. The temperature variation caused by each type of cancer on the healthy tissue was correlated with auxiliary temperature profiles. These auxiliary temperature profiles were obtained with no prior knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the tumor apart from the mean values for thermal conductivity and blood perfusion of the layers of healthy breast tissue. The results showed that the maximum error for geometric center estimation was 0.32 cm for invasive lobular carcinoma, with a diameter of 1 cm, positioned 5 cm from the skin surface. Thus, this work contributes to studies aiming to improve the use of infrared thermography for early breast cancer diagnosis, as the results showed that localization of tumors using only superficial temperature profiles does not require prior knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the tissues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Certain types of smokeless tobacco (SLT) products, particularly snus, carry fewer health risks than cigarette smoking and might be able to serve as harm-reduction products for smokers. However, studies frequently find that smokers misperceive SLT and snus to be as or more harmful than smoking. This perception is often measured with a single general harm question, and research on underlying risk perceptions is limited. Methods: Using a sample of 256 current smokers, we utilized Latent Profile Analysis to examine response profiles to items that assessed perceived risk of specific health outcomes (lung cancer, heart disease, oral cancer) from snus relative to cigarettes, along with the typical single item measure of overall harm from snus compared to cigarettes. Results: Three smoker response profiles emerged. Almost half (44.9%) of smokers perceived snus to be as or more risky than cigarettes for all three specific health outcomes (group 1), while over one third (38.3%) had an elevated perceived risk for oral cancer only (group 2). About 17% of smokers perceived snus to have lower risks for lung cancer only (group 3). Across each profile, perceived risk was highest for oral cancer. Conclusions: If smokers are to consider snus for harm-reduction, efforts may be needed to better inform smokers about their lower relative risks, including for particular health outcomes of interest. This study also suggests that smokers may vary in their level of need for information to correct their relative risk misperceptions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) in promoting quality of life in Neyshabur women with breast cancer. Methods: This study was an interventional design that was conducted on 124 women with breast cancer (any stage) in Iran 2018. One hundred and fourteen women with breast cancer were paired by age and randomized to either 12-week MBAT intervention group or a wait-list-control group. One hundred and fourteen women with breast cancer completed both the pre-and post-study measurements. As compared to the control group, the MBAT group demonstrated a significant decrease in symptoms of distress and significant improvements in key aspects of the health-related quality of life (as measured by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life -BREF questionnaire). Results: The MBAT interventions had a significant effect on improving quality of life behaviors (P < 0.05). Among the dimensions of quality of life, the highest mean score was for subpsychological (18.14 ± 2.35), and the lowest score was achieved by the subdomains of social relationships (13.54 ± 1.12). The mean (standard deviation) scores of physical health and environment were 17.19 ± 3.55 and 16.10 ± 1.87, respectively. Conclusions: This investigation of MBAT provides initial encouraging data that support a possible future role for the intervention as a psychosocial option for decrease in symptoms of women with breast cancer and quality of life. © 2018 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co.

    "Abstract": "In this work, DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) with unique fluorescent and electrochemical properties are prepared as dual signal probes for both qualitative imaging and quantitative detection of cancer cells in an integrated system. ITO electrode that has good light transmittance and electric conductivity is employed as a substrate for dual analysis of cancer cells. ITO electrode is firstly modified by AS1141 aptamer, which could selectively bind to nucleolin overexpressed on the surface of a model breast cancer cell, MCF-7 cell line. The composite of mucin 1 antibody (anti-MUC1) and DNA-AgNCs then binds to MUC1 on the surface of captured MCF-7 cell, forming a sandwich-like structure. Therefore, our method allows noninvasive fluorescence imaging and amplified electrochemical detection using a single labeling platform, providing a biocompatible and highly specific method for adequate analysis of cancer cells. Experimental results demonstrate that strong red fluorescence of DNA-AgNCs clearly displays the loading of cancer cells on ITO electrode after dual recognition, and amplified electrochemical signals of DNA-AgNCs enable improved sensitivity toward quantitative analysis with a detection limit of 3 cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that caveolin-1 (CAV-1) is a stress-related oncotarget and closely correlated to chemoresistance. Targeting CAV-1 might be a promising strategy to improve chemosensitivity for breast cancer treatment. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a bioactive compound purified from Astragalus membranaceus, has been shown to exhibit multiple bioactivities, including anticancer. However, the involved molecular targets are still ambiguous. In this study, we investigated the critical role of CAV-1 in mediating the chemosensitizing effects of AS-IV to Taxol on breast cancer. We found that AS-IV could enhance the chemosensitivity of Taxol with minimal direct cytotoxicity on breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, as well as the nontumor mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. AS-IV was further demonstrated to aggravate Taxol-induced apoptosis and G2/M checkpoint arrest. The phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), except p38, was also abrogated by a synergistic interaction between AS-IV and Taxol. Moreover, AS-IV inhibited CAV-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner and reversed CAV-1 upregulation induced by Taxol administration. Mechanism study further demonstrated that AS-IV treatment triggered the eNOS/NO/ONOO − pathway via inhibiting CAV-1, which led to intense oxidant damage. CAV-1 overexpression abolished the chemosensitizing effects of AS-IV to Taxol by inhibiting oxidative stress. In vivo experiments further validated that AS-IV increased Taxol chemosensitivity on breast cancer via inhibiting CAV-1 expression, followed by activation of the eNOS/NO/ONOO − pathway. Taken together, our findings not only suggested the potential of AS-IV as a promising candidate to enhance chemosensitivity, but also highlighted the significance of CAV-1 as the target to reverse cancer drug resistance. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Surgical stress has been suggested to facilitate colon cancer growth and metastasis. However, the precise mechanisms by which surgical trauma promotes colon cancer progression remain poorly understood. Methods: To unravel the mechanisms underlying surgery-induced colon cancer progression, a syngenic transplantation tumor model was established with CT26 cells, and the effect of laparotomy on tumor progression was investigated. Especially, the expression of several chemokines was assessed, and their roles in recruiting CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) after surgery were analyzed. Results: Tregs population was significantly increased in the tumor tissue and peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice after laparotomy. C-C motif chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) expression was significantly upregulated after laparotomy in tumor tissue and the peritoneal cavity of tumor-bearing mice, and it was positively correlated with the recruitment of Tregs. Functionally, CCL18 knockdown significantly reduces tumor growth and angiogenesis compared with control. Through analysis of Tregs, we found an upregulated proportion of Tregs in tumor tissue, peritoneal cavity, and peripheral blood after laparotomy, but this enhancement was blocked after CCL18 knockdown. In patients with colon cancer, a higher Tregs proportion is positively correlated to more advanced clinical TNM stages and shorter survival. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between the serum CCL18 level and the Treg proportion in clinical samples. Conclusion: Surgical trauma contributes to colon cancer progression by increasing CCL18 expression and hence promotes Treg recruitment, which leads to an immunosuppressive environment. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Background: In colorectal cancer (CRC), inflammatory responses have been reported to associate with patient survival. However, the specific signalling pathways responsible for regulating inflammatory responses are not clear. Src family kinases (SFKs) impact tumourigenic processes, including inflammation. Methods: The relationship between SFK expression, inflammatory responses and cancer specific survival (CSS) in stage I-III CRC patients was assessed using immunohistochemistry on a 272 patient discovery cohort and an extended 822 patient validation cohort. Results: In the discovery cohort, cytoplasmic FGR associated with improved CSS (P = 0.019), with membrane HCK (p = 0.093) trending towards poorer CSS. In the validation cohort membrane FGR (p = 0.016), membrane HCK (p = 0.019), and cytoplasmic HCK (p = 0.030) all associated with poorer CSS. Both markers also associated with decreased proliferation and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, cytoplasmic HCK was an independent prognostic marker compared to common clinical factors. To assess synergy a combine FGR + HCK score was assessed. The membrane FGR + HCK score strengthened associations with poor prognosis (p = 0.006), decreased proliferation (p < 0.001) and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (p < 0.001). Conclusions: SFKs associate with prognosis and the local inflammatory response in patients with stage I-III CRC. Active membrane FGR and HCK work in parallel to promote tumour progression and down-regulation of the local inflammatory lymphocytic response. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs have been proved to be the biomarker for early detection of pancreatic cancer and the precisely quantitation of the MicroRNA-10b in the blood samples even can distinguish pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal controls (NC). In this study, we developed a DSN-assisted dual-SERS biosensor for microRNA-10b in exosome and residual plasma of blood samples detection based on the Fe 3 O 4 @Ag-DNA-Au@Ag@DTNB (SERS tag) conjugates. In presence of target microRNA, it can hybridized with the complementary DNA probes. DSN enzyme was then added to selectively cleaves the DNA probe of the DNA/microRNA duplex, SERS tags can be released from the Fe 3 O 4 @Ag and SERS intensity quenching can be triggered, the released microRNA can enter the cycle to decluster other DNA and SERS tags. Due to the dual-SERS enhancement of the Fe 3 O 4 @Ag-SERS tag conjugates and the recycling signal amplification, a detection limit of 1 aM with single-base recognition can be performed by one step. The target microRNA in plasma-derived exosome and residual supernatant plasma of blood samples from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal controls (NC) were directly quantified and significant SERS signal distinction can be found among them. The precise quantitation, one-step and one-pot operation can ensure this assay a promising future for point-of-care cancer diagnosis technology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The bioconjugate of alginate and curcumin (AA-CUR) was synthesized in a simple, one-step process and used to prepare the stable calcium cross-linked spherical micelles serving as a delivery vehicle for curcumin. Above its critical micelle concentration (0.6 mg/ml) AA-CUR forms colloidally stable micelles of ca. 200 nm. Prolonged, well controlled release of curcumin was observed from the AA-CUR micelles cross-linked with calcium ions for 5 h under the physiological conditions. To assess the safety of applying the bioconjugate into the bloodstream for possible anti-cancer applications, the interaction between AA-CUR and cells isolated from human blood was analyzed. No red cells aggregation or hemolysis was observed. AA-CUR was also shown to have no significant cytotoxicity to the human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors and to the mouse primary brain endothelial cells. To evaluate the efficiency of the obtained bioconjugate in the anti-cancer therapy, the micellar solution of AA-CUR was tested against various cancer cells lines: mammary carcinoma 4T1, melanoma B16F10 and colon carcinoma CT26-CEA and MC38-CEA. The bioconjugate at the concentration of 0.7 mg/ml decreased the viability of cancer cells by ca. 80%. The cellular uptake of AA-CUR was rapid and the highest micelles accumulation was detected within 1 h after treatment. The AA-CUR micellar system can serve as an effective and safe delivery vehicle for curcumin. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Martinique has one of the highest incidences of prostate cancer (PCa) worldwide. We analysed overall survival (OS) among patients with PCa in Martinique, using data from a population-based cancer registry between 2005 and 2014. Methods: The log-rank test was used to assess the statistical differences between survival curves according to age at diagnosis, risk of disease progression including Gleason score, stage at diagnosis and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). A multivariable Cox model was constructed to identify independent prognostic factors for OS. Results: A total of 5045 patients were included with a mean age at diagnosis of 68.1±9.0 years [36.0 – 98.0 years]. Clinical stage was analysed in 4999 (99.1% of overall), 19.5% were at low risk, 34.7% intermediate and 36.9% at high risk. In our study, 8.9% of patients with available stage at diagnosis, were regional/metastatic cancers. Median PSA level at diagnosis was 10.4 ng/mL. High-risk PCa was more frequent in patients aged 65-74 and ≥75 years as compared to those aged <65 years (36.6% and 48.8% versus 28.7% respectively; p<0.0001). One-year OS was 96.3%, 5-year OS was 83.4 and 10-year OS was 65.0%. Median survival was not reached in the whole cohort. High-risk PCa (HR=2.32; p<0.0001), regional/metastatic stage (HR= 9.51; p<0.0001) and older age (65-74 and ≥75 years - respectively HR=1.70; and HR=3.38), were independent prognostic factors for OS (p<0.0001). Conclusion: This study provides long term data that may be useful in making cancer management decisions for patients with PCa in Martinique. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Because the role of the primary tumour location in the adjuvant setting has not been clearly established in colon cancer, we analysed the clinical outcome according to the primary tumour location from three Italian trials assessing adjuvant therapy in colon cancer. Patients and methods: Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed globally and in each trial, according to right-sided, transverse and left-sided primary colon cancer. Analysis was planned to provide overall and stage-specific results. Results: Individual data of 5239 patients were included in this analysis. The right-sided tumours were 1540 (29%), tumours originating in the transverse were 815 (16%) and left-sided tumours were 2884 (55%). At the multivariate analysis, DFS findings from the comparison of the right-sided versus left-sided tumours (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89–1.14) were not statistically associated with clinical outcomes in the overall population. On the contrary, OS findings, from the comparison of the right-sided versus left-sided tumours, were significantly associated with outcomes (HR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.04–1.39). In stage II patients, there was no difference in terms of DFS and OS among the three different tumour locations, whereas in stage III patients, the left-sided tumours showed an improved prognosis in terms of OS (HR: 1.36 95% CI = 1.14–1.62, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This is the largest analysis demonstrating a prognostic effect of the tumour location on patients with colon cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the effect is limited to OS in stage III colon cancer. In stage II tumours, the primary location has a lesser impact. The transverse tumours should be prognostically considered in between the right-sided and left-sided tumours. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. To overcome the toxic side effects and multidrug resistance (MDR) during doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy, a urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) targeting U11 peptide decorated, pH-sensitive, dual drugs co-encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) system is employed in this study. A U11 peptide conjugated, pH-sensitive DOX prodrug (U11-DOX) was synthesized and used as materials to produce NPs. A curcumin (CUR) and U11-DOX co-encapsulated NPs system (U11-DOX/CUR NPs) was constructed to treat lung cancer. After the characterization of biophysical properties of this NPs system, synergistic chemotherapeutic efficacy was evaluated in both cultured cancer cells and tumor-bearing animal model. U11-DOX/CUR NPs had a uniformly spherical shape with a core-shell structure. The mean particle size and zeta potential of the U11-DOX/CUR NPs was 121.3 nm and -33.5 mV, with a DOX and CUR EE of 81.7 and 90.5%, respectively. The DOX release from U11-DOX/CUR NPs was 83.5, 55.2, and 32.8% correspondence to the pH of 5.0, 6.0 and 7.4. Cellular uptake efficiency of U11-DOX/CUR NPs was significantly higher than non U11 peptide decorated DOX/CUR NPs. U11-DOX/CUR NPs displayed a pronounced synergy effects in vitro and an obvious tumor tissue accumulation efficiency in vivo. In vivo antitumor experiment showed that U11-DOX/CUR NPs could inhibit the tumor growth to a level of 85%.In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that U11-DOX/CUR NPs is a sustained released, pH responsive, synergistic antitumor system. This study suggests that the U11-DOX/CUR NPs have promising potential for combination treatment of lung cancer. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Cinnamomum cassia has been widely studied in different fields to reveal its antidiabetic, antidepressive, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antiosteoporotic, and anticancer effects. Its antimalignant activities have been explored in lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and even oral cancer, but the detailed signaling mechanism and effects of this plant on animal models need to be clarified. In the current study, C. cassia extract (CCE) was used to investigate the antitumorigenesis mechanism in vitro and in vivo. The major constituents of CCE used in this study were coumarin, cinnamic acid, and cinnamic aldehyde. CCE reduced the viability, number, and colony formation of human oral cancer cells, and induced their apoptosis. Caspase-3 activation, Bcl-2 reduction, and phosphatidylserine inversion were involved in CCE-stimulated apoptosis. CCE also enhanced the expression of autophagic markers, including acidic vesicular organelle, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-I, autophagy-related protein 14, rubicon, and p62. The combined treatment of CCE and caspase inhibitor significantly restored mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ ψ m ) and cell viability. However, the combined treatment of CCE and autophagy inhibitor further reduced the cell viability indicating that autophagy might be a survival pathway of CCE-treated SASVO3 cells. In contrast, CCE treatment for 12 days did not adversely affect SASVO3 tumor-bearing nude mice. CCE also elicited dose-dependent effects on the decrease in tumor volume, tumor weight, and Ki-67 expression. These results suggested that CCE showed the potential for the complementary treatment of oral caner. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Label-free and in situ detection of N-glycan expression on surface of cells is vital for understanding the progression of cancer. Herein, cytosensing based on U-shaped fiber optic local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) was developed for cancer cell detection and N-glycan evaluation on cell surface. The U-shaped fiber optic LSPR has high refractive index sensitivity (RIS). Therefore, U-shaped fiber optic LSPR cytosensing afforded ultrasensitivity for cancer cell detection with the limit of detection (LOD) of 30 cells/mL and good linearity in a wide range of 1×10 2 -1×10 6 cells/mL under the optimal conditions of modified AuNPs size and Con A concentration. The U-shaped fiber optic LSPR cytosensing shows more than 29 times lower limit of detection than the straight ones. More importantly, the prepared U-shaped cytosensing was applied to evaluate the N-glycan expression level on the surface of cancer cells under different concentration external stimuli of inhibitor tunicamycin (TM). Noticeably, U-shaped fiber optic LSPR cytosensing showed an acceptable reproducibility, satisfactory anti-interference and good selectivity, and was also applied in the assessment of N-glycan expression on surface of six kinds of cell lines. Therefore, the U-shaped fiber optic LSPR offers a feasible tool in biophysical research and clinical diagnosis for cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Family caregivers of children with cancer face emotional, psychological, and spiritual challenges coping with their child's illness. For ensuring comprehensive multidisciplinary pediatric care, there is a need to understand and define what spirituality means for them in relation to their child's illness. The purpose of this study is to understand the meaning of spirituality for parents of cancer patients in Lebanon. Methods: This qualitative study followed the Heideggerian interpretive phenomenological method. Through purposeful sampling, 11 parents (mother or father) of children with cancer receiving treatment at a tertiary care center in Beirut, Lebanon were interviewed. Data were analyzed following the hermeneutical process as described by Diekelmann and Ironside (1998). Results: A constitutive pattern and overarching theme, “spirituality is a two-level relationship. It is a relation with God and with people. It is the act of receiving and giving back” and five major themes emerged from the data. These were “Being there for me; ” “Connectedness with other parents is a blessing and a torment; “ “The power of knowing; ” “Communication with Unknown\" and “Spirituality is not religiosity”. Conclusion: Lebanese parents of children with cancer defined the elements of their own spirituality. Relational aspects dominated and communication was an important factor. Implications for practice: This is the first study in the Middle East to address the meaning of spirituality in this population, and would pave the way for a customized palliative care program and integrative approach to patient care. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "We evaluated the relation of fruit and vegetable consumption, including specific fruits and vegetables, with incident breast cancer characterized by menopausal status, hormone receptor status and molecular subtypes. Fruit and vegetable consumption, cumulatively averaged across repeated, validated questionnaires, was examined in relation to risk of invasive breast cancer among 182,145 women initially aged 27–59 years in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS, 1980–2012) and NHSII (1991–2013). Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for known risk factors, was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed tumors by hormone receptor status and molecular subtypes. We prospectively documented 10,911 invasive breast cancer cases. Greater intake of total fruits and vegetables, especially cruciferous and yellow/orange vegetables, was associated with significantly lower breast cancer risk (&gt;5.5 vs. ≤2.5 servings/day HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.83–0.96; p trend = 0.006). Intake of total vegetables was especially associated with lower risk of estrogen receptor negative tumors (HR per 2 additional servings/day as a continuous variable = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.77–0.93; p heterogeneity = 0.02). Among molecular subtypes, higher intake of total fruits and vegetables (HR per 2 additional servings/day as a continuous variable) was most strongly associated with lower risk of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched (HR = 0.79, 95%CI = 0.67–0.93), basal-like (HR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.72–0.97) and luminal A (HR = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.89–0.99), but not with luminal B tumors (p heterogeneity = 0.03). In conclusion, our findings support that higher intake of fruits and vegetables, and specifically cruciferous and yellow/orange vegetables, may reduce the risk of breast cancer, especially those that are more likely to be aggressive tumors. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Background: The serine/threonine kinase IKBKE is frequently overexpressed or activated in a variety of human cancers. Ectopic expression of IKBKE induces malignant transformation, cell migration, invasion and chemoresistance. Thus, IKBKE is an attractive target for anti-cancer drug development. Methods: By screening of NCI Diversity Set and Clinical Collection I and II compound libraries using cell-based assay, we identified several candidates of IKBKE inhibitors, which directly inhibited IKBKE kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. One of them, malachite green oxalate (MCCK1), was further characterized. The mechanism was examined by western blot, immunoprecipitation (IP) and Immunofluorescence. We also evaluated in a mouse xenograft model. In vitro kinase assay and luciferase reporter assay were also performed in our experiments. Results: MCCK1 inhibits IKBKE kinase as well as its downstream targets such as IκBα p65 and IRF3. MCCK1 is a selective inhibitor for IKBKE, with moderate effect on TBK1, but does not inhibit the activation of IKKα/β STAT3, Erk-1/2, p38 or JNK. The inhibition of IKBKE by MCCK1 resulted in induction of cell growth arrest and apoptosis selectively in human cancer cells that harbor aberrant expression of IKBKE. Furthermore, MCCK1 inhibits tumor growth in nude mice of human cancer cells in which IKBKE is elevated but not of those cancer cells in which it is not. Conclusion: These data indicate that MCCK1 is an IKBKE inhibitor with anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo and could be a potential anti-cancer agent for patients with tumors over expressing IKBKE. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: This study compared women who received all recommended breast cancer treatments (Receivers) with those who did not (Decliners). We sought to understand women's integrative naturopathic oncology (INO) use in addition to usual conventional oncology (UCO) use, their involvement in treatment decision-making (TDM), and their satisfaction with healthcare providers. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using baseline data from the Breast Cancer Integrative Oncology Study that recruited 427 women from INO clinics (INO cohort) and comparison women from the Cancer Surveillance System Registry who received UCO care (UCO cohort) in Western Washington State. Self-reported data and Registry data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and X2 tests to compare Receivers and Decliners in demographic and disease characteristics, use of INO in addition to UCO care, involvement in TDM, and satisfaction with healthcare providers. Results: Significantly more Decliners were in INO cohort than UCO cohort. Decliners in INO cohort were less likely to receive radiotherapy. Women who used INO care, and Decliners, compared with Receivers, tended to be “very involved” in their TDM. No difference was found in participation congruence, correspondence between preferred and actual involvement in medical TDM, between groups. Decliners in INO cohort reported significantly less satisfaction with their conventional oncologist than Receivers in INO cohort. Conclusions: Decliners of conventional adjuvant therapies were very involved in their TDM and those Decliners who seek INO care were less satisfied with their conventional oncologist; these women may need the most attention to assure they receive the care they need. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Adjuvant chemotherapy shows clear benefits in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (BC). Its benefits are less universal in BCs expressing hormone receptors. The 21-gene Oncotype DX ® Breast Recurrence Score test was designed for HR+, HER2– early-stage BC before decision on adjuvant chemotherapy. Its validity and utility was demonstrated prospectively across multiple studies. The observational study PONDx characterized the use of Oncotype DX ® Breast in routine practice in France and evaluated its decision impact. Of 882 ER-positive BC patients (67% postmenopausal), most (79%) had N0/Nmic node involvement, grade 2 tumors (68%), tumor size 1–5 cm (88%), and ductal histology (78%). BCs with histopathologically elevated recurrence risk included grade 3: 18%; N1: 21%; Ki67 &gt; 20%: 31%. Recurrence Score results by prognostic category were: &lt;18: 54%, 18–30: 36%; &gt;30: 10%. Compared to recommendations before individual availability of the score, results prompted net absolute reductions in chemotherapy recommendations of 36% (total population), and 29% (grade 3 and/or Ki67 &gt; 20% histologies). Decisions reflected prognostic implications: in the Recurrence Score &lt;18 category, 95% of patients received recommendations of hormonal therapy only, in the &gt;30 category, 97.5% were recommended additional chemotherapy; 95% followed the final recommendations of their physicians. The Recurrence Score provides independent predictive and prognostic information in ER + N0/N1 early BC, including high-risk subgroups. PONDx further characterizes the population where the test is beneficial in real-life use and fits current clinical needs. Oncotype DX ® Breast enables relevant net reductions in chemotherapy use, sparing patients from serious toxicities. Its therapeutic implications are highly accepted by physicians and patients. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Expression of the retinoic acid-induced protein 3 (RAI3) has been suggested to predict clinical outcome in a variety of malignancies. However, its role in esophageal cancers remains unclear. Immunohistochemical RAI3 staining was analyzed on tissue microarrays containing 359 esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) and 254 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). RAI3 immunostaining was typically absent or weakly detectable in the membranes in benign esophageal tissues. RAI3 staining was higher in malignant than in benign esophagus epithelium. High-levels of RAI3 staining were found in 79.2% of interpretable EACs and 55.9% of ESCCs. In EACs, strong RAI3 staining was associated with advanced pathological tumor stage (p <.0001), high UICC stage (p <.0001), high tumor grade (p =.0133), and positive lymph nodal status (p =.0002). Additionally, high RAI3 staining predicted shortened overall survival of EAC and ESCC patients (p =.0298 and p =.0227). RAI3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in esophageal cancers. We propose that RAI3 overexpression might play a biologically relevant role of RAI3 in esophageal cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pancreatic cancer (PC) has become the fourth most lethal among human cancers. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play a role in the progression of a variety of cancers. However, the role of lncRNA SNHG1 in PC is not clear. Methods: Real-time Quantitative PCR Detection System (qPCR) was used to detect the expression of SNHG1 in PC cells. Then, the SNHG1 knockdown cell was constructed with si-SNHG1. AsPC-1 and PANC1 cells were used to analyze the ability of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. MTT assay was used to analyze the proliferation ability. Transwell experiments and wound healing experiments were used to detect the capacity of invasion and migration. Finally, Western blot analysis was used to explore the mechanism of SNHG1 in PC. Results: SNHG1 was significantly upregulated in PC cells. Knockdown of SNHG1 could obviously suppress cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, SNHG1 knockdown inhibited the activation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway and inhibited the expression of N-cadherin, Hes1, Vimentin, Notch-1. The inhabitation was reversed when Notch-1 was overexpressed in si-SNHG1 cells. Conclusion: The lncRNA SNHG1 promotes cell growth and metastasis in PC through activation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway in PC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cyclic long noncoding RNAs have recently become major players in cancer biology and can serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and as potential therapeutic targets. We explored circulating LINC00342 as a predictor of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression of LINC00342 in tissues, serum, PBMC, and NSCLC cell lines were screened by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A multistage validation and risk score formula detection analysis was used. The effect of LINC00342 on proliferation was assessed by MTT, p53, and PTEN pathways, which were analyzed by Western blot analysis. We found that LINC00342 was upregulated in the tissues, serum, and PBMC of patients with NSCLC. In addition, patients with higher LINC00342 expression levels were associated with poor overall survival. For the diagnosis of NSCLC, the specificity and sensitivity of LINC00342 were significantly higher than that of CYFRA 21-1. Moreover, LINC00342 promoted proliferation by inhibiting the expression of p53 and PTEN proteins in NSCLC cell lines. Our study demonstrates that LINC00342 is involved in the development, and LINC00342 may be a potential diagnostic factor and a target for new therapies for future patients with NSCLC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Neuroglobin (NGB), an antiapoptotic protein upregulated by 17β-estradiol (E2), is part of E2/estrogen receptor α (ERα) pathway pointed to preserve cancer cell survival in presence of microenvironmental stressors including chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, the possibility that resveratrol (Res), an anticancer plant polyphenol, could increase the susceptibility of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel (Pacl) by affecting E2/ERα/NGB pathway has been evaluated. In MCF-7 and T47D (ERα-positive), but not in MDA-MB 231 (ERα-negative) nor in SK-N-BE (ERα and ERβ positive), Res decreases NGB levels interfering with E2/ERα-induced NGB upregulation and with E2-induced ERα and protein kinase B phosphorylation. Although Res treatment does not reduce cell viability by itself, this compound potentiates Pacl proapoptotic effects. Notably, the increase of NGB levels by NGB expression vector transfection prevents Pacl or Res/Pacl effects. Taken together, these findings indicate a new Res-based mechanism that acts on tumor cells impairing the E2/ERα/NGB signaling pathways and increasing cancer cell susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agent. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has recently illustrated therapeutic potential for malignant disorders. However, the clinical application of siRNA-based therapeutics is significantly retarded by the paucity of successful delivery systems. Recently, multifunctional gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as non-viral delivery carriers have shown promise for transporting chemotherapeutics, proteins/peptides, and genes. In this study, AuNPs capped with polyethylenimine (PEI) and PEGylated anisamide (a ligand known to target the sigma receptor) have been developed to produce a range of positively charged anisamide-targeted PEGylated AuNPs (namely Au-PEI-PEG-AA). The anisamide-targeted AuNPs effectively complexed siRNA via electrostatic interaction, and the resultant complex (Au 110 -PEI-PEG 5000 -AA.siRNA) illustrated favourable physicochemical characteristics, including particle size, surface charge, and stability. In vitro, anisamide-targeted AuNPs selectively bound to human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, inducing efficient endosomal escape of siRNA, and effective downregulation of the RelA gene. In vivo, prolonged systemic exposure of siRNA was achieved by anisamide-targeted AuNPs resulting in significant tumour growth suppression in a PC3 xenograft mouse model without an increase in toxicity. In addition, a combination of siRNA-mediated NF-κB knockdown using anisamide-targeted AuNPs with Paclitaxel produced a synergistic therapeutic response, thus providing a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy plays a crucial role in combined treatment modality in local advanced rectal cancer (LARC). While neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy responses were variable in LARC patients, so, it is important to identify genes that closely associated with short-term and long-term responses to radiotherapy. In this study, we profiled long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression values of LARC patients with different neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy downstaging depth score based on Agilent Arraystar Human LncRNA V3.0 Array(Agilent, CA). LncRNAs and mRNAs with aberrant expression values between the two groups of LARC patients were identified and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulation network was also obtained through the combination of miRcode and miRTarBase database. Gene interaction network and module analysis of differential expression mRNAs contained in the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network identified five hub genes, including KRAS, PDPK1, PPP2R5C, PPP2R1B, and YES1, that should be closely associated with LARC’s response to chemoradiotherapy. Besides, Kaplan-Meier analysis based on the Cyber Research Center (CRC) data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas indicated that aberrant expression of the five hub genes is significantly associated with CRC overall survival. In conclusion, we obtained several biomarkers that should be associated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy response in LARC, which should be helpful for individual treatment and prognosis improvement. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "R-spondins comprise a group of secreted WNT agonists. R-spondin2 (RSPO2) plays a crucial role in the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway and oncogenesis, though its specific role in human gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. In the current study, RSPO2 expression levels were upregulated in cancer specimens and cell lines (AGS and BGC-823). Inhibition of RSPO2 expression levels had distinct effects on cell invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in AGS and BGC-823 cells in vitro. Furthermore, RSPO2 positively correlated with leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), the receptor of RSPO2. Silencing RSPO2 reduced the expression of LGR5 and WNT/β-catenin effector molecule β-catenin together with downstream targets TCF-4 and Cyclin-D1. These observations demonstrate that upregulation of RSPO2 in GC specimens and cell lines is closely related to tumor invasion and migration and that RSPO2 promotes EMT in gastric cancer cells by activating WNT/β-catenin signaling. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Pulmonary delivery of anti-cancer drugs in the form of nanoparticulate dry powders is considered a promising modality for treating lung cancer. However, it is not known whether the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of nano-preparations are altered after co-spray drying. In this study, we compared the physicochemical property, anti-cancer activity, tumor targeting and pharmacokinetic behavior of docetaxel-loaded folic acid-conjugated liposomes (LPs-DTX-FA) with those of dry powder prepared by co-spray-drying LPs-DTX-FA. The particle size and PDI after re-dispersion of the powder were increased. The re-dispersed liposomes showed increased cellular uptake via micropinocytosis and exhibited higher cytotoxicity than LPs-DTX-FA. Tumor targeting of re-dispersed liposomes was less effective compared with LPs-DTX-FA but the metabolism of re-dispersed liposomes was decreased. Tracheal administration resulted in a 45-fold higher concentration of docetaxel in the lung of Sprague Dawley rats at 30 min as compared with intravenous administration. Our results indicated that co-spray drying did change the properties, while tracheal administration of the dry powder provided higher drug exposure at the tumor site without increasing the exposure of other organs. Thus, inhaled dry powders might be clinically effective for treatment of lung cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have been demonstrated to extensively participate in a wide spectrum of biological activities ranging from embryogenesis and cancer progression. HOX transcript antisense RNA (Hotair), an lncRNA located in the HOXC locus, has been reported to play an important role in carcinogenesis. As a well-known oncogene, it potentiates cancer metastasis and tumor progression. And it also serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis and tumor recurrence. In this study, Hotair was found to be upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and clinical specimens. Further investigation showed that knockdown of Hotair dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting that Hotair may stimulate tumorigenesis of CRC. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a regulator of epigenetic modification, was upregulated in CRC cells and clinical samples. And the silence of EZH2 significantly suppressed cell viability and colony formation. Furthermore, the RNA immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Hotair directly bound EZH2 in CRC cells. In conclusion, Hotair mediated tumorigenesis via recruiting EZH2, which might shed light on the development of a novel therapeutic approach for patients with CRC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Glucose metabolism is a common target for cancer regulation and microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of this process. Here we aim to investigate a tumor-suppressing miRNA, miR-33b, in regulating the glucose metabolism of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In our study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that miR-33b was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, which was correlated with increased cell proliferation and colony formation. Overexpression of miR-33b through miR-33b mimics transfection suppressed NSCLC proliferation, colony formation, and induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-33b overexpression inhibited glucose metabolism in NSCLC cells. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-33b directly binds to the 3′-untranslated region of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that miR-33b downregulated the expression of LDHA. Moreover, introducing LDHA mRNA into cells over-expressing miR-33b attenuated the inhibitory effect of miR-33b on the growth and glucose metabolism in NSCLC cells. Taken together, these results confirm that miR-33b is an anti-oncogenic miRNA, which inhibits NSCLC cell growth by targeting LDHA through reprogramming glucose metabolism. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Developing concise theranostic prodrugs is highly desirable for personalized and precision cancer therapy. Herein we used the glutathione (GSH)-mediated conversion of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonates to phenols to protect a catechol moiety and developed stable pro-catechol-type diphenylpolyenes as small molecule-based prooxidative anticancer theranostic prodrugs. These molecules were synthesized via a modular route allowing creation of various pro-catechol-type diphenylpolyenes. As a typical representative, PDHH demonstrated three unique advantages: (1) capable of exploiting increased levels of GSH in cancer cells to in situ release a catechol moiety followed by its in situ oxidation to o-quinone, leading to preferential redox imbalance (including generation of H 2 O 2 and depletion of GSH) and final selective killing of cancer cells over normal cells, and is also superior to 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin, the widely used chemotherapy drugs, in terms of its ability to kill preferentially human colon cancer SW620 cells (IC 50 = 4.3 μM) over human normal liver L02 cells (IC 50 = 42.3 μM) with a favourable in vitro selectivity index of 9.8; (2) permitting a turn-on fluorescent monitoring for its release, targeting mitochondria and therapeutic efficacy without the need of introducing additional fluorophores after its activation by GSH in cancer cells; (3) efficiently targeting mitochondria without the need of introducing additional mitochondria-directed groups. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "An extracellular polysaccharide (EPS1-1) of Rhizopus nigricans was found to enhance immunity and reduce colon cancer cell proliferation. Here, the effect of EPS1-1 on a mouse model of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) induced by azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was investigated. Pathological symptoms, including weight loss, piloerection, hematochezia and insensitivity caused by AOM/DSS, were relieved by EPS1-1. Anatomical results showed a 100% tumor incidence, a series of neoplasms, disordered cell structure and hyperplastic glands in the model group, while the abnormal behaviors were relieved and the tumors decreased in the EPS1-1 group. Compared with the model group, the EPS1-1 group showed decreased oncogenic protein (COX-2, β-catenin, CyclinD1 and C-Myc) expression. TUNEL staining showed that EPS1-1 increased the apoptosis of colon cancer cells in mice. Furthermore, the expression of proliferative proteins (Ki-67 and PCNA) and an antiapoptotic gene transcript (Bcl-2) were significantly down regulated by EPS1-1, while apoptotic gene transcripts (p53 and Bax) were enhanced. In addition, EPS1-1 notably decreased the number of cells positive for CD68, F4/80 and NF-κB and reduced the concentrations of inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-6) in serum compared with those in the model group. Taken together, these results suggest that EPS1-1 may be a therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of CAC. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The aim was to analyze the effects of pessimism, depression, fatigue, and pain on functional health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with resected, non-advanced breast cancer. Methods: A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in 440 breast cancer patients. They completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL-Questionnaire-Core-30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), and the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). Results: Prevalence rates of pessimism and depression were 23.3% and 40.0%, respectively. Fatigue and pain were the most common symptoms, 8.8% and 4.2%, respectively. Patients without a partner were more pessimistic that partnered ones; those with a lower level of education and subjects without a partner exhibited more depression. Depression was a major factor that proved to have the greatest explanatory power for HRQoL (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning) and global health status (R 2 range: 0.13 to 0.39). Of the five domains, fatigue had a significant effect on four and pain, on two. Conclusion: This study reveals the impact of depression and pessimism on physical, psychological, social, and quality-of-life aspects and the importance of evaluating them in patients who are going to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor due to high recurrence rate and ineffective treatment options, highlighting the need to better understand the mechanism of recurrence and metastasis in HCC. Methods: We first collected messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data from 442 cases of HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database as well as 251 HCC patients from Zhongshan Hospital during 2009 and 2010 to analyze the expression pattern from tissue microarray (TMA) of baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3). Then, we used BIRC3 gain-of-function (overexpression) and loss-of-function (knockdown) studies to examine the effect of BIRC3 on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, we also investigated the undying mechanism by which BIRC3 contributes to HCC tumor progression. Functionally, we also used a BIRC3-specific inhibitor AT-406 in HCC xenograft model to explore the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting BIRC3 in liver cancer. Results: BIRC3 serves as a novel prognostic indicator for HCC patients undergoing curative resection. BIRC3 promotes HCC epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and metastasis via upregulating MAP3K7, therefore, inducing ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The specific BIRC3 inhibitor AT-406 can inhibit HCC cell proliferation and reduce pulmonary metastases. Conclusion: BIRC3 induces tumor proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. BIRC3 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for liver cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: : Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionised cancer care especially in lung cancer. New response patterns have been described under ICIs such as pseudo-progression or hyper-progressive disease (HPD). The definition of HPD is yet to be consensual. The aim of this study was to suggest a clinical definition of nivolumab-refractory patients and find factors associated with this entity. Methods: : We performed a multi centric retrospective study including all patients who received nivolumab for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) during the French authorisation for temporary use in 2015. Results: : 303 patients were included in the cohort and 292 had details on the number of nivolumab injections received. 57 patients (20%) were nivolumab-refractory. These patients had worse PS at nivolumab initiation (p < 0.0001), shorter duration of treatment before nivolumab (p = 0.028) and had dramatically shorter nivolumab overall survival (p < 0.0001) than patients who did not present with refractory disease. Conclusion: : Nivolumab-refractory disease can affect up to 20% of patients treated with nivolumab for advanced NSCLC with dramatically shortened survival rates. Further studies are needed to understand the precise mechanisms leading to refractory disease as well as its management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly malignant bile duct cancer with poor prognosis characterized by its insensitivity to chemotherapy. Emerging evidence indicates that cytoprotective antioxidation is involved in drug resistance of various cancers; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we demonstrated that atypical protein kinase Cι (aPKCι) mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition in a kinase-independent manner, which played a crucial role in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, we found that aPKCι facilitated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) accumulation, nuclear translocation and activated its target genes by competing with Nrf2 for binding to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) through a highly conserved DLL motif. In addition, the aPKCι-Keap1 interaction was required for antioxidant effect, cell growth and gemcitabine resistance in GBC. Importantly, we further confirmed that aPKCι was frequently upregulated and correlated with poor prognosis in patients with GBC. Collectively, our findings suggested that aPKCι positively modulated the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway to enhance GBC growth and gemcitabine resistance, implying that the aPKCι-Keap1-Nrf2 axis may be a potential approach to overcome the drug resistance for the treatment of GBC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Photo-activated therapy is a non-invasive and promising medical technology for the treatment of cancers. Herein, we present Ce6-HA-CIS phototherapeutic nanohybrids composed of Cu-In-S (CIS) heterostructured nanorod (HS-rod), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and hyaluronic acid (HA) for the use in targeted photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT). In the Ce6-HA-CIS nanohybrids, the CIS HS-rod was investigated as a PTT agent to convert light into thermal energy, with Ce6 acting as a PDT agent to generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ). HA encapsulated the surface of the CIS HS-rod and aided the hydrophobic CIS HS-rod in achieving aqueous solubility. HA also acts as a tumor-specific targeting vector of cancer cells bearing the cluster determinant 44 receptor. Under light irradiation, the fabricated Ce6-HA-CIS nanohybrids exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency, good photo-stability, and satisfactory photodynamic activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Ce6-HA-CIS showed low cytotoxicity and synergistic photodynamic and photothermal cancer cell killing effects as compared to PTT or PDT agents alone. Therefore, these phototherapeutic nanohybrids may enhance cancer therapy in future clinical applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Isolation of specific single chain antibodies (scFvs) against key epitopes of cancer markers are applied for cancer immunotherapy and diagnosis. In this study following the prediction of the 3D structure of the DSP part of Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), the epitope was chosen using in silico programs. Panning process was applied to isolate specific human scFv against the epitope. PCR and DNA fingerprinting differentiated the specific clones, which were evaluated by phage ELISA. Following DNA sequencing, the 3D structure of isolated scFv was modeled and Docked on DSP. Results demonstrated the selection of a specific anti-DSPP scFv with 40% frequency, which reacted significantly with the predicted epitope and PCa patients' urines in ELISA tests (P-value < 0.05). The VH and VL of the isolated scFv were from VH1 and VL3 gene families with several amino acid changes in CDRs and FRs domains. The scFv tightly bound to the DSP epitope with the lowest energy level by hydrogen bonds, cation-pi, hydrophobic and ionic interactions demonstrating the specificity of Ag-Ab interactions. The anti-DSPP scFv selected in this study with significant specificity to DSPP antigen offers a promising new agent for both PCa early detection and treatment of cancers with DSPP expression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: We performed profiling of the immune microenvironment of castration-resistant (CRPC) and castration-sensitive (CSPC) prostate cancer (PC) in order to identify novel targets for immunotherapy. Methods: PD-L1 and CD3/CD8 immunohistochemistry, PD-L1/2 fluorescent in situ hybridization, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, and RNA-seq of 395 immune-related genes were performed in 19 CRPC and CSPC. Targeted genomic sequencing and fusion analysis were performed in 17 of these specimens. Results: CD276, PVR, and NECTIN2 were highly expressed in PC. Comparison of CRPC versus CSPC and primary versus metastatic tissue revealed the differential expression of immunostimulatory, immunosuppressive, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. Unsupervised clustering of differentially expressed genes yielded two final clusters best segregated by CRPC and CSPC status. Conclusion: CD276 and the alternative checkpoint inhibition PVR/NECTIN2/CD226/TIGIT pathway emerged as relevant to PC checkpoint inhibition target development. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Based on the promise of liposomes as convenient vehicles for the transport of boronated agents for the boron neutron capture therapy (BCNT) of cancer, this paper reports a method for the formulation and characterisation of stable o-carborane-loaded liposomes (ca. 80–100 nm) of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or 1,2-distearol-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DSPC). Preliminary pharmaceutical characterisation experiments have demonstrated the integrity of both DPPC and DSPC liposomal membranes in serum and in PBS and also indicate that these o-carborane-loaded liposomes are candidate carrier vehicles for further evaluation with a view to exploitation in BNCT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Changes in the expression of proteins on cancer cell surface are a typical outcome of malignant transformation. Natural killers (NKs) utilize a set of activating and inhibitory receptors that enable them to recognize altered protein expression and then destroy 'stressed' cells such as cancer or virus-infected cells. Major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A and B (MICA and MICB, respectively) are expressed by various human tumors and can be recognized by activating NK cell receptor NKG2D. However, cancer frequently escapes recognition by NK cells by proteolytic shedding of MICA and MICB proteins. A study carried out by Ferrari de Andrade and colleagues showed that monoclonal antibody targeting the site of proteolytic shedding of MICA and MICB reduced the progression of melanoma in immunocompromised and immune competent mice models by activation of NKG2D. This approach prevented the reduction of essential immunostimulatory ligands (MICA/MICB) and restored NK cell-driven anticancer immunity.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The luminal/Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative subtype of breast cancer has low chemo-sensitivity. When neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is indicated in this subtype, before a possible breast-conserving surgery (BCS), it is more reasonable to target tumor shrinkage than complete pathological tumor response. We aimed to identify breast and tumor 18 Fluoro-deoxy-glucose ( 18 F-FDG) PET-CT scan imaging features for the early prediction of BCS after NAC in luminal/HER2 negative subtypes of breast cancer. Material and methods: Seventy-seven consecutive women with luminal/HER2-negative breast cancer for whom BCS was initially not feasible and NAC was prescribed, to decrease tumor size before surgery, were included retrospectively. An 18 F-FDG PET-CT scan exam was performed before and after the first course of NAC. Results: After NAC, 36% (28/77) of women had a mastectomy and 64% (49/77) underwent BCS. Patients with a mastectomy had lower total breast volume (BV total ) (p = 0.002), lower decrease in Δmetabolic tumor volume (ΔMTV) (p = 0.03) and lower SUV max2 (p = 0.05). Using ROC Curve analyses to define the optimal predictive threshold of BV total (496 cm 3 ) and ΔMTV (-17.1%), 3 subgroups of women with different odds of BCS after treatment were identified (p = 0.001): low, medium and high probability groups (respectively 29%, 62% and 82%). Conclusions: For patients with Luminal/HER2 negative breast cancer, the combination of the imaging features of the tumor and the mammary gland, obtained with 18 F-FDG PET-CT at baseline and after the first cycle of NAC, may allow the physician to evaluate the probability of BCS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: Secondary angiosarcoma is known to be associated with lymphoedema or radiation after cancer treatment. This systematic review aims to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of secondary angiosarcoma commonly arising after breast cancer treatment. Materials and methods: A systematic review was carried out according to the PRISMA protocol. Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched for English articles to April 2018 with predefined strategy. Retrieved studies were independently screened and rated for relevance. Data were extracted by two researchers. Results: There were 72 secondary angiosarcomas of the limbs. Most patients (n = 68, 94.4%) had a history of lymphoedema. The median latent period was 15 years (range 3–40 years). Thirty-eight (52.8%) patients received wide excision or amputation as a treatment for the angiosarcoma, two (2.8%) patients received isolated limb perfusion and one (1.4%) patient received systemic chemotherapy. The remaining patients received palliative care/undocumented treatment. The pooled median duration to mortality was 10.5 months (range 1–144 months). Of note, obesity was documented in seven (9.7%) patients. There were 83 breast angiosarcomas; all with known breast cancer history. Thirty-one (37.3%) patients received mastectomy as breast cancer treatment. Fifty-four (65.1%) patients had a history of adjuvant radiotherapy for the primary breast cancer. The median latent period was 6 years (range 2–50 years); the median size was 40 mm (range 8–200 mm). Forty-one (49.4%) patients received wide excision, 19 (22.9%) patients received completion mastectomy and 23 (27.7%) patients have undocumented treatment for angiosarcoma. The pooled median duration to mortality was 31 months (range 6–168 months). Conclusion: Angiosarcoma in lympedematous upper limbs or after breast cancer irradiation remains uncommon. However, its long latency and high mortality warrant long-term vigilant surveillance. © 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists",

    "Abstract": "The use of anesthetic analgesic drugs in patients with cancer pain is analyzed comprehensively, which provides the necessary reference for rational use of drugs in clinic. Method: 102 patients with cancer pain are selected from a municipal people's hospital from 2014 to 2016 in China. Based on the Bayesian algorithm of geometric reconstruction, the variety, dosage, prescription number, specification and frequency of anesthetic analgesic drugs used by patients are analyzed comprehensively. Results: the anesthetic analgesic drugs used by 102 patients with cancer pain mainly include Morphine Hydrochloride Injection, Tramadol Injection, Dezocine Injection, Morphine Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets, Tramadol Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets, Oxycodone Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets and Fentanyl Transparent Dressing. Among them, the dosage of Morphine Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets is the highest, followed by Tramadol Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets, Oxycodone Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets, Fentanyl Transparent Dressing, Morphine Hydrochloride Injection, Tramadol Injection and Dezocine Injection. The drug use frequency of Fentanyl Transparent Dressing is the highest and the lowest is Dezocine Injection. The drug utilization index of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets is the lowest, and that of Morphine Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets is the highest. Conclusion: The use principle of anesthetic analgesic drugs for cancer patient with pain basically conforms to the three-step analgesic principle of cancer pain, and the dosages and specifications of anesthetic drugs are basically reasonable, but need to be further standardized and rationalized. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although palliative care services are increasing in the United States, disparities exist in access and utilization. Hence, we explored these factors in hospitalized patients with advanced cancers using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS). Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of NIS data, 2005 to 2014, and included patients ≥18 years with advanced cancers with and without palliative care consultations. Both χ 2 and independent t tests were used for categorical and continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regressions were used for identifying factors associated with palliative care consultations. Results: Palliative care consultations were recorded in 9.9% of 4 732 172 weighted advanced cancer hospitalizations and increased from 3.0% to 15.5% during 2005 to 2014 (relative increase, 172.2%, P trend &lt;.01). Factors associated with higher palliative care consultations were increasing age, ≥80 years (odds ratio [OR]: 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-1.56); black race (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.14-1.28); private insurance coverage (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02-1.18); West region (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.01-1.33); large hospitals (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.02-1.34); high income (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.08-1.17); do-not-resuscitate (dying patients) status (OR: 10.55; 95% CI: 10.14-10.99); and in-hospital radiotherapy (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.21). Palliative care consultations were lower in patients with chemotherapy (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.60-0.84). Conclusion: Many demographic, socioeconomic, health-care, and geographic disparities were identified in palliative care consultations. Additionally, palliative care resources were underutilized by hospitalized patients with advanced cancers and commonly utilized by patients who are dying. Health-care providers and policy makers should focus on these disparities in order to improve palliative care use. © The Author(s) 2018.",

    "Abstract": "A series of new pyranocarbazole derivatives were synthesized via semi-synthetic modification of koenimbine (1a) and koenidine (1b) isolated from the leaves of Murraya koenigii. Among all, compound 3bg displayed significant anti-cancer activity against MDA-MB-231, DU145 and PC3 cell lines with the IC 50 values of 3.8, 7.6 and 5.8 μM, respectively. It was also observed that the halogenated-benzyl substitution at N-9 position, C-3 Methyl and C-7 methoxy group on carbazole motif are favoured for anti-cancer activity. The detailed investigation was carried out with compound 3bg and its SEDDS (self-emulsifying drug delivery systems) formulation 3bgF. The in vivo drug release behavior study showed that the formulation enhanced slow release and better bioavailability at a tumor site. Compound 3bg and its formulation (3bgF) significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, induced G2/M arrest, reduced cellular ROS generation and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. 3bg also induced significant alteration of Bax/Bcl expression ratio suggesting involvement of mitochondrial apoptosis. Additionally, 3bg caused down-regulation of mTOR/Akt survival pathway. 3bg do not bind to DNA, but interacts with tubulin as observed with in silico molecular docking studies. This interaction results in stabilization of tubulin polymerization similar to paclitaxel as detected in cell-free assay. Oral administration of 3bgF for 30 days at dose rate of 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight significantly reduced tumor growth in syngenic rat LA-7 mammary tumor model. These results indicated that the pyranocarbazole natural product based N-substituted analogues can act as potential anti-cancer lead. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) as a human carcinogen and one of the most toxic industrial and environmental pollutant mimics the estrogenic effects in cell proliferation. So, it might have a role in the incidence and etiology of hormone-related cancers such as ovarian cancer as the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. This study aimed to evaluate the estrogenic effect and underlying mechanism of Cd in ovarian cancer cell line proliferation. OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cell lines were treated with different concentrations of CdCl 2 (0- 50 μM). Cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT and BrdU assay. To evaluate the estrogenic effect of Cd, the cells were pre-incubated with estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780. The expression of ER was determined using western blotting method. Real-time RT-PCR method was used to assess c-fos, c-jun and FOXO3a mRNA level. The results showed that Cd has an estrogenic proliferative effect at nM concentration range and ICI 182,780 significantly reversed the CdCl 2 -induced cell proliferation. Cd also increased the expression of ERs. Cd exposure induced activation of p-ERK1/2 in these cells. Cd also intensified c-jun, c-fos, and FOXO3a mRNA expression. Taken together, the current work suggests that Cd induces ovarian cancer cell proliferation in an ER-dependent mechanism induced ERK1/2 activation pathway. Understanding of downstream targets by which Cd deregulates cell proliferation can be noteworthy to define its underlying carcinogenesis mechanism. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is an important chemical that widely used in our life. Mounting evidences show that BPA can leak into environment, which associates with the health risks, such as initiation and metastasis of cancer, but the mechanisms still need to be interpreted. Integrin β1 is the most known subunit in integrin family, its abnormal expression and activation are tightly linked to tumorigenesis and a number of hallmarks of cancer. Here we show that environmental concentration (10 −8 M) of BPA exposure can quickly activate integrin β1 to induce cancer cell migration, and this effect is proved as a direct interaction between BPA and integrin β1, which is independent from classical or non-canonical estrogen receptors. The data further indicates that residues S134, D137 and E229 in integrin β1 played important roles in the interaction as predicted by AutoDock Vina, and confirmed by spectroscopy and native-PAGE. The study is the first to show a tumorigenic mechanism of BPA on tumor metastasis by the direct activation of integrin β1 molecule, and give rise to profound concerns about widespread use of BPA in the manufacture of plastics and human health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "A previous study comparing external beam radiation therapy with/without brachytherapy (EBRT ± BT) and radical prostatectomy (RP) for high-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) did not find a difference in overall survival (OS) between the treatments. However, this study was limited by short follow-up and assessment of OS in patients of divergent age and comorbidities. We therefore compared OS of EBRT + BT versus RP in comparatively young (≤65 yr) and healthy men (Charlson Comorbidity Index = 0) with high-risk localized PCa in the National Cancer Database. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjustment was used to balance baseline characteristics. Median follow-up was 92 mo (interquartile range 78–108). Using IPTW-adjusted Cox regression analysis, EBRT + BT was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with RP (hazard ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.05–1.43). In young and healthy men presenting with high-risk localized PCa, RP showed statistically significant OS benefit compared with EBRT + BT. Patient summary: In an analysis restricted to young and healthy men presenting with high-risk localized prostate cancer, initial radical prostatectomy is associated with an overall survival benefit compared with external beam radiation therapy plus brachytherapy. In an analysis restricted to young and healthy men presenting with high-risk localized prostate cancer, initial radical prostatectomy is associated with an overall survival benefit compared with external beam radiation therapy plus brachytherapy. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Abstract": "Facilely constructed metal nanoparticles with highly active sites, high economic impact, and stable electrocatalysts are crucial to developed sensory protocol for oxygen reactive species (ORS) released from cancer cells. In this study, we control the fabrication of uniformly arranged non-metal sphere catalysts that interfacially dressed by Ru nanoparticles for ultrasensitive ORS-sensing electrode patterns from cancer cells. The actively dressing of spherical ˜10 nm-Ru nano-buds/bumps that markedly interlinked entire micrometric surfaces of well-developed sulfur-doped carbon (S–C) spheres led to create catalytic surface defects through formation anisotropic wrinkling skins due to homogenous dispersion of bump mapping networks. These anisotropic protrusions create interfacial Ru@S–C surfaces with highly active catalytic sites, caves and grooves, roughness along the exterior S–C sphere–skin matrices, enabling a well-thought-out sensory signaling of ORS released from cancer cells. Specifically, our designed Ru@S–C modified electrode offers well-defined reading out transduction and end-point stimulus-responsive signaling of ORS molecules such as H 2 O 2 . The design of wrinkled Ru@S–C sphere sensory electrode provided H 2 O 2 -sensing assay with high sensitivity (314 μA μM −1 cm −2 ) and selectivity, low detection limit (25 nM based on 3σ), and wide linear ranges of detection reached up to 2 mM in physiological systems. Our findings indicated that highly active electrocatalysts based on wrinkling Ru@S–C can be employed for the in vitro detection of ORS released from cancer cells (HeLa cells) with high sensitivity and selectivity, low cytotoxicity, high biocompatibility, and fast response time, as well as detection of oxidative stress effects on living cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Adjuvant chemotherapy is routinely offered post-surgical resection for early stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≥4 cm; however, its role following definitive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has not been well defined. We investigated the association between receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy post-SBRT and overall survival (OS) for patients with T1-T3N0M0 NSCLC in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Materials and Methods: The NCDB was queried for patients with T1-T3N0M0 NSCLC treated with definitive SBRT from 2004 to 2014. The association between non-randomized receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy and OS was analyzed for all patients (n = 24,011) and a propensity-matched cohort (n = 608) using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazard models. A subset analysis was performed for patients with tumors ≥4 cm (n = 2,323). Results: There were 24,011 patients in the cohort with a median follow-up of 32.5 months. Of these, 322 (1.3%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Three-year OS was 41.3% with adjuvant chemotherapy compared to 50.6% without adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was independently associated with higher overall mortality (hazard ratio:1.22, 95% confidence interval:1.06–1.40, p = 0.005). For tumors ≥4 cm, 3-year OS was 38.2% with adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 80) compared to 33.0% without adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.81). After propensity-score matching, there was a persistent association between lower OS and adjuvant chemotherapy with those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 322) having 3-year OS of 41.3% compared to 60.9% without adjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Adjuvant chemotherapy following definitive SBRT for T1-3N0M0 NSCLC is associated with lower OS and is not associated with a survival benefit for patients with tumors ≥4 cm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Young people (YP) returning to school after a cancer diagnosis and treatment have to decide who has the right to know about their cancer experiences and how to distribute this information to peers. Young people face unique challenges in this area because of their life stage, their need to reintegrate with peers, and their own approach to their disease and treatment. This paper explores the perspectives of young people as they return to school during and after curative cancer treatment. Method: 12 young people (6 females, 6 males) from the north of England (aged 13–16 years at time of recruitment) took part in photo elicitation interviews conducted at three time points during the year following a diagnosis of lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, A-plastic anaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: Three main themes emerged: ‘approaches to telling’ ‘lives becoming public property’; and ‘owning the story’. Within these themes participants experienced stressors related to altered peer group dynamics, being propelled into the foreground of the school environment, being responsible for the feelings and needs of others, and conflicts between their perception of coping and the reactions of others. Conclusions: Re-entering school following a diagnosis of cancer can result in challenging dynamics for a young person, which they are not always equipped to manage. Participants displayed individual differences in their approaches and preferences, but inevitably all had to cope with their lives becoming public property and managing the narrative of their cancer experience. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "H-Ras oncogene plays a critical role in the transformation of normal cells to a malignant phenotype through constitutive activation of the GTP bound protein leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation in several human cancers. Thus, H-Ras oncoprotein serves as an excellent target for anticancer drug discovery. To identify novel H-Ras inhibitors, we performed structure-based virtual screening of the Maybridge HitFinder™ library using Schrodinger suite. Thirty ligands from the chemical library were identified as they showed preferential in silico binding initially to H-Ras proteins with Gly12Val, Gly13Asp, and Gly12Val-Gly13Asp mutations. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile confirmed drug-like properties of the compounds. Three representative molecules were tested for antiproliferative effect on T24 urinary bladder carcinoma cell line, MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and HDF-7 normal dermal fibroblast cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Two compounds (Cmpds) showed antiproliferative activity exclusively in the cancer cell lines with minimal effect on the control HDF-7 cells. The effect of compound treatment on cell cycle progression, assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining, depicted increased arrest of T24 cell line in the sub G1 phase. Further, Annexin-V PI dual staining and pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk indicated caspase-dependent apoptotic activity of Cmpds 1 and 3. Our findings demonstrate caspase-dependent apoptotic activity of Cmpds 1 and 3 selectively against Gly12Val mutated T24 cancer cell line implicating a potential for treatment of bladder cancer. We envisage that these molecules may be promising candidates with potential therapeutic value in H-Ras mutation-associated cancers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Studies suggest acupuncture improves cancer-related symptoms; however, it is unclear whether patient characteristics predict pain response. This study determined acupuncture’s effect on cancer-related pain and identified variables associated with pain response. Methods: A retrospective chart review included adult patients with cancer referred to palliative medicine and received acupuncture for pain management. Paired t tests compared differences in pain scores from pre- to postacupuncture. Clinically meaningful pain improvement was defined as ≥2-point reduction in pain score. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between patient characteristics and pain improvement. Results: One hundred seventy acupuncture treatments from 68 individual patients were studied. Significant reductions in mean pain scores were observed after the first treatment (−1.9 ± 1.8; P <.001) and across all treatments (−1.7 ± 1.9; P <.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated clinically meaningful pain improvement with higher baseline pain scores (odds ratio [OR]: 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-2.22; P <.001) and stage III/IV disease (OR: 3.23, 95% CI: 1.11-9.40; P <.001). There were significant improvements in anxiety, depression, drowsiness, dyspnea, fatigue, nausea, and well-being after the first treatment and across all treatments (P <.001). Conclusions: Acupuncture improved cancer-related pain and other symptoms. Those with higher baseline pain scores and advanced disease were more likely to achieve significant pain reduction. Improved depression and fatigue were closely related to pain reduction. Further studies are needed to confirm pain response variables, establish durability, and develop a personalized approach to acupuncture. © The Author(s) 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide but incidence varied widely. Despite the role of genetics, CRC is also sensitive to macro-environmental factors. Few studies have ever compared across different countries/regions to suggest possible macro-environmental risk factors of CRC. We estimated the effects of age, period and cohort on the changes of incidence of colorectal cancer across different countries/regions. Methods: Poisson regression age-period-cohort (APC) models were conducted to estimate the age, period and cohorts effects on CRC incidence across the West (i.e., the UK, the US and Australia) and Asia (i.e. Japan, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and India). We maximized the length of the study period according to each country's data availability. Results: Western populations show upward inflections for their 1950s–1960s cohorts, while Asian populations (except India) show downward inflections for their 1950s cohorts. Japanese population also shows upward inflections for its 1960s cohorts, similar to the Western populations. There are apparent upward inflections towards the more recent cohorts for Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore; nevertheless, the confidence intervals are wider towards the more recent cohorts. Conclusion: Our findings imply an increasing risk of CRC in both Western and Asian populations as their younger cohorts reach older ages. These findings are consistent with the life course argument that macro-environmental changes associated with socio-economic development have specific effects that extend over the life course.

    "Abstract": "Background: Implantation of rat prostate cancer cells into the normal rat prostate results in tumor-stimulating adaptations in the tumor-bearing organ. Similar changes are seen in prostate cancer patients and they are related to outcome. One gene previously found to be upregulated in the non-malignant part of tumor-bearing prostate lobe in rats was the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ). Methods: To explore this further, we examined C/EBPβ expression by quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot in normal rat prostate tissue surrounding slow-growing non-metastatic Dunning G, rapidly growing poorly metastatic (AT-1), and rapidly growing highly metastatic (MatLyLu) rat prostate tumors―and also by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray (TMA) from prostate cancer patients managed by watchful waiting. Results: In rats, C/EBPβ mRNA expression was upregulated in the surrounding tumor-bearing prostate lobe. In tumors and in the surrounding non-malignant prostate tissue, C/EBPβ was detected by immunohistochemistry in some epithelial cells and in infiltrating macrophages. The magnitude of glandular epithelial C/EBPβ expression in the tumor-bearing prostates was associated with tumor size, distance to the tumor, and metastatic capacity. In prostate cancer patients, high expression of C/EBPβ in glandular epithelial cells in the surrounding tumor-bearing tissue was associated with accumulation of M1 macrophages (iNOS+) and favorable outcome. High expression of C/EBPβ in tumor epithelial cells was associated with high Gleason score, high tumor cell proliferation, metastases, and poor outcome. Conclusions: This study suggest that the expression of C/EBP-beta, a transcription factor mediating multiple biological effects, is differentially expressed both in the benign parts of the tumor-bearing prostate and in prostate tumors, and that alterations in this may be related to patient outcome. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Gremlin 1 (GREM1), as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) novel agonist, has been confirmed as overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues but its role in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here we reported that the GREM1 expression in mesenchymal-like colon cancer cells (SW620 and SW480) was significantly higher than that of epithelial-like colon cancer cells (Caco-2, HTC116, and HT29) and normal colon cell. Simultaneously, we analyzed two series of CRC transcriptomes from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases and found the great majority of primary CRC tissues expressed high level of GREM1 messenger RNA (mRNA) compared with adjacent normal tissues, and that the GREM1 mRNA expression is correlated with low histological grade development and stage 2 to 3 metastatic recurrence in CRC based on a data analysis of 104 different stage CRC tissue from the GEO databases. Functional studies showed that GREM1 silencing by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly inhibited CRC cells proliferation, migration, the formation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced capillary structure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer cells by repressing phosphorylation levels of BMP downstream signal Smad1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) downstream signal matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), and metastasis-related factor C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) expression. In addition, shGREM1 combined with VEGF inhibitor BAW2881 displayed more effective antiangiogenesis to inhibit the tube formation of HUVEC. Hence, these experiments demonstrated that GREM1 is involved in CRC development and procession and provide a new idea for CRC diagnosis, resistance therapy, and prognosis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: In breast cancer, large tumor size, positive nodal stage and a triple-negative tumor subtype are associated with reduced survival, but the interactions between these prognostic factors are not well understood. Material and methods: Here we re-evaluated the impact of tumor size, nodal stage and tumor subtype on disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) in a retrospective analysis using data from the adjuvant SUCCESS A trial. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess whether the effect of tumor size and nodal stage on survival depended on tumor subtype. Results: Increasing tumor size, higher nodal stage and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) were associated with unfavorable prognosis (all p < 0.001). There was no significant interaction between tumor subtype and tumor size (p > 0.5 for all four survival endpoints), but we found significant interactions between tumor subtype and nodal stage (p < 0.05 for all four survival endpoints), with no differences in survival among tumor subtypes for patients with pN0 tumors (all p > 0.05) and pronounced differences in survival among tumor subtypes for patients with positive nodal stage (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: This analysis confirms tumor size, nodal stage and tumor subtype as independent prognostic factors in high-risk early breast cancer. Nodal-positive patients with TNBC had a considerably worse outcome compared to nodal-positive patients with another tumor subtype. This underlines the importance for early detection particularly for patients with TNBC. Trial registration: EudraCT 2005-000490-21; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02181101. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The HERBERT study was a dose-finding feasibility study of a high-dose rate endorectal brachytherapy (HDREBT) boost after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in elderly patients with rectal cancer who were unfit for surgery. This analysis evaluates the association of patient, tumor and dosimetric parameters with tumor response and toxicity after HDREBT in definitive radiotherapy for rectal cancer. Patients and methods: The HERBERT study included 38 inoperable patients with T2-3N0-1 rectal cancer. Thirteen fractions of 3 Gy EBRT were followed by three weekly HDREBT applications of 5–8 Gy per fraction. Clinical and dosimetric parameters were tested for correlation with clinical complete response (cCR), sustained partial/complete response (SR), patient reported bowel symptoms, physician reported acute and late proctitis (CTCAE v3) and endoscopically scored toxicity. Results: Thirty-five patients completed treatment and were included in the current analyses. Twenty of 33 evaluable patients achieved a cCR, the median duration of a sustained response was 32 months. Tumor volume at diagnosis showed a strong association with clinical complete response (OR 1.15; p = 0.005). No dose–response correlation was observed in this cohort. Prescribed dose to the brachytherapy CTV (D90) correlated with acute and late physician reported proctitis while CTV volume, CTV width and high dose regions in the CTV (D1cc/D2cc) were associated with endoscopic toxicity at the tumor site. Conclusion: Tumor volume is the most important predictive factor for tumor response and a higher dose to the brachytherapy CTV increases the risk of severe clinically and endoscopically observed proctitis after definitive radiotherapy in elderly patients with rectal cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Baduanjin exercise, which is a traditional Chinese Qigong exercise, in breast cancer survivors to assess its efficacy for physical and psychological rehabilitation. Methods: The study was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Eighty-six subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 46) or control (n = 40) groups. The intervention group received Baduanjin exercise 3 days/week at hospital and another 4 days/week at home for 6 months, whereas the control group were requested to maintain their original physical activity. Outcomes included body mass index (BMI), heart rate variability, lung capacity, arm circumference, shoulder range of motion, step test index, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL). Results: After 6 months of intervention, heart rate variability and shoulder range of motion were significantly improved in the Baduanjin group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). There were also significant improvements in depression, QOL, and four QOL dimension scores (physical well-being, social well-being, functional well-being, and breast cancer subscale) (P < 0.05). However, there were no differences in the BMI, lung capacity, arm circumference, step test index, anxiety, and the emotional well-being QOL dimension scores. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that Baduanjin is an effective intervention for improving physical and psychological health outcomes among breast cancer survivors, which is worth recommending and implementing by oncology nurses for breast cancer survivors during their long rehabilitation journeys. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: SMAD3 is pivotal in the biology functions of various tumors. This study is aiming to study the relationship among SMAD3, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) OPA-interacting protein 5 antisense transcript 1 (OIP5-AS1), and miR-143-3p, and their effects on cervical cancer. Methods: In our research, real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay were conducted to detect the expression level of messenger RNA and protein in tumor tissues and cells. Transfection of lncRNA OIP5-AS1, miR-143-3p, or SMAD3 was performed to investigate their potential effects on the function of cell as well as the relationship among them in cervical cell lines via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) together with transwell assays or dual-luciferase reporter assay respectively. Results: SMAD3, lncRNA OIP5-AS1 expression is significantly enhanced in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, but miR-143-3p was inhibited. LncRNA OIP5-AS1 is demonstrated to mediate the physiological process of cervical cancer cells. Moreover, silencing SMAD3 via siRNA suppressed cell number, viability, migration and invasion, whereas overexpression of OIP5-AS1 promoted these abilities. Furthermore, lncRNA OIP5-AS1 exert its function via sponging miR-143-3p to regulate SMAD3 expression. Conclusions: LncRNA OIP5-AS1 promoted SMAD3 expression via mediating miR-143-3p to promote migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: A recent study using national data from 2000 to 2009 identified colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality “hotspots” in 11 counties of North Carolina (NC). In this study, we used more recent, state-specific data to investigate the county-level determinants of geographic variation in NC through a geospatial analytic approach. Method: Using NC CRC mortality data from 2003 to 2013, we first conducted clustering analysis to confirm spatial dependence. Spatial economic models were then used to incorporate spatial structure to estimate the association between determinants and CRC mortality. We included county-level data on socio-demographic characteristics, access and quality of healthcare, behavioral risk factors (CRC screening, obesity, and cigarette smoking), and urbanicity. Due to correlation among screening, obesity and quality of healthcare, we combined these factors to form a cumulative risk group variable in the analysis. Results: We confirmed the existence of spatial dependence and identified clusters of elevated CRC mortality rates in NC counties. Using a spatial lag model, we found significant interaction effect between CRC risk groups and socioeconomic deprivation. Higher CRC mortality rates were also associated with rural counties with large towns compared to urban counties. Conclusion: Our findings depicted a spatial diffusion process of CRC mortality rates across NC counties, demonstrated intertwined effects between SES deprivation and behavioral risks in shaping CRC mortality at area-level, and identified counties with high CRC mortality that were also deprived in multiple factors. These results suggest interventions to reduce geographic variation in CRC mortality should develop multifaceted strategies and work through shared resources in neighboring areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment has previously been reported to be hypercapnic (as high as ~84 mmHg), although its effect on tumor cell behaviors is unknown. In this study, high CO 2 levels, ranging from 5% to 15%, protected lung cancer cells from anticancer agents, such as cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide, by suppressing apoptosis. The cytoprotective effect of a high CO 2 level was independent of acidosis and was due to mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming that reduced mitochondrial respiration, as assessed by oxygen consumption, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial membrane and oxidative potentials, eventually leading to reduced reactive oxidant species production. In contrast, high CO 2 levels did not affect cisplatin-mediated DNA damage responses or the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins. Although high CO 2 levels inhibited glycolysis, this inhibition was not mechanistically involved in high CO 2 -mediated reductions in mitochondrial respiration, because a high CO 2 concentration inhibited isolated mitochondria. A cytoprotective effect of high CO 2 levels on mitochondria DNA-depleted cells was not noted, lending support to our conclusion that high CO 2 levels act on mitochondria to reduce the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents. High CO 2 -mediated cytoprotection was also noted in a 3D culture system. In conclusion, the hypercapnic tumor microenvironment reprograms mitochondrial respiratory metabolism causing chemoresistance in lung cancer cells. Thus, tumor hypercapnia may represent a novel target to improve chemosensitivity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: A huge amount of the efforts made by health teams is dedicated to caring for cancer patients. This study has aimed to investigate the effect of self-care training on life expectancy and quality of life (QOL) in patients with gastrointestinal cancer who were under radiotherapy. Methods: In this clinical trial, 50 patients were selected using the block randomization method. The intervention was performed at Ayatollah Khansari Hospital in Arak, Iran. The patients in the intervention group received three sessions of face-to-face training. The data collection tools included Schneider's Life Expectancy Questionnaire and EORTC QOLQ-C30. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 23. Results: In the control group, 16 were male (64%) and 9 female (36%), and in the intervention group, 14 were male (56%) and 11 were female (44%). Before the intervention, the two groups were homogenous regarding all variables. After the intervention, the mean of QOL was 67 ± 22.62 in the intervention group and 56 ± 18.55 in the control group (P < 0.05). In examining the different dimensions of QOL, improvement in all functional dimensions was observed in the intervention group. After the intervention, the mean score of life expectancy showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) between the intervention group (39.52 ± 5.26) and the control group (31.6 ± 7.13). Conclusions: It was found that self-care training improved the QOL and life expectancy of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who were under radiotherapy. Therefore, self-care training is recommended to improve the QOL and the life expectancy of cancer patients. © 2018 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co. Ltd | Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",

    "Abstract": "The expression and levels of secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), important Wnt signalling antagonists, have been reported to be reduced in various cancers, and are associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. During tumour development, all sFRP (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) genes are hypermethylated, causing transcriptional silencing. sFRPs have an ability to sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, enhancing cell death. Reduced Wnt signalling is associated with loss of cancer stem cell (CSC) viability. We investigated the possible involvement of methylation-mediated silencing of the sFRP gene family in CSCs derived from breast, prostate, and ovarian tumour cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR studies indicated that loss or downregulation of sFRP (1-5) expression in tumours is associated with promoter hypermethylation. Additionally, CSCs derived from all tumour cell lines with sFRP (1-5) promotor hypermethylation expressed sFRP (1-5) mRNA after treatment with 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza), especially sFRP4, implying that DNA methylation is the predominant epigenetic mechanism for sFRP (1-5) silencing. Furthermore, post-translational modification (PTM) in total and histone proteins was observed post 5-Aza and sFRP4 treatment. Protein levels of Wnt downstream signalling components (GSK3β active β-catenin, and phospho β-catenin) and epigenetic factors of histones (acetyl histone H3, and H3K27me3) affecting PTM were analysed. Our findings suggest that downregulation of sFRP4 expression in endocrine-related cancers can be attributed to aberrant promoter hypermethylation in conjugation with histone modification, and indicate the important role of methylation-induced gene silencing of sFRP4 in survival and proliferation of CSCs derived from these cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The combination of ascorbate and menadione (VC:VK3 = 100:1) is an investigational treatment for cancer under clinical trials. Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the oxidized form of ascorbate, can be taken up by cells via glucose transporters, over-expressed in many cancer cells. It has been known that the combination of VC/VK3 kills cancer cells by inducing hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) via a redox cycling reaction. However, the mechanism has not been fully understood yet. Intracellularly, DHA is reduced to ascorbate by NADPH via GSH and glutaredoxin as well as by thioredoxin (Trx) and the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). These two systems are also critical as electron donors for ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which produces deoxyribonucleotides de novo for DNA replication and DNA repair and is highly expressed in tumor cells. We found that RNR was highly sensitive to VC/VK3 in vitro with similar effects as observed with H 2 O 2 . In cancer cells, VC/VK3 inhibited RNR mainly by targeting its R2 subunit. More importantly, both the Trx and GSH systems were oxidized by the combination, which resulted in the loss of GSH, increased protein glutathionylation, and highly oxidized Trx1. The mechanism of cell death induced by VC/VK3 was also elucidated. We found that VC/VK3 inhibited glutathione peroxidase activity and led to an elevated level of lipid peroxidation, which triggered apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) mediated cell death pathway. Therefore, the combination not only induced replicative stress by inhibiting RNR, but also oxidative stress by targeting anti-oxidant systems and triggered AIF-mediated cancer cell death. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy is still a standard treatment of unresectable bladder cancer or distant metastases. The chemotherapy resistance always occurs after a period of treatment indicating poor prognosis. The current study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells. The gene expression profiles of GSE77883, including three untreated T24 cells samples and three gemcitabine-resistant T24 cells samples, was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), gene function analysis, and interaction prediction between microRNAs (miRNAs) and DEGs were performed by R software. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) and miRNA-DEGs networks were constructed and visualized by Cytoscape software. Then, the small molecules, with potential synergistic or antagonistic effects to gemcitabine resistance, were identified using the Connectivity Map database. Finally, gemcitabine-resistant T24 cell line was established and key genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In total, 536 upregulated and 513 downregulated genes were screened and mainly enriched in oxidative stress response and signaling pathways related to extracellular matrix–receptor interaction and focal adhesion. PPI network showed interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor, kinesin family member 11, and BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B were key genes. The miRNA-DEGs regulatory networks included 18 miRNAs and 185 DEGs, including miR-182-5p, miR-590-3p, miR-320a and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1). Then, the related key genes and miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, 81 small molecules with antagonistic or synergistic effect to GEM were screened. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms driving GEM-resistance in bladder cancer cells that would contribute to the development of chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Although insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) has been accepted as a major determinant of cancers, its biological roles and corresponding mechanisms in tumorigenesis have remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that IGF-1R plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain and functions during colitis and tumorigenesis. Heterozygous knockout IGF-1R attenuated azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and colitis associated cancer (CAC) in Igf1r +/- mice. Heterozygous knockout IGF-1R confers resistance to oxidative stress-induced damage on colorectal epithelial cells by protecting mitochondrial dynamics and structures. IGF-1R low expression improves the biological function of mitochondrial fusion under oxidative stress. Mechanically, an increase in respiratory coupling index (RCI) and oxidative phosphorylation index (ADP/O) was seen in colorectal epithelial cells of Igf1r +/- mice. Seahorse XF e -24 analyzer analysis of mitochondrial bioenergetics demonstrated an increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and a decrease of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in Igf1r +/- cells. Further analysis suggests the protection mechanisms of Igf1r +/- cells from oxidative stress through the activation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and LKB1/AMPK pathways. These results highlight the biological roles of IGF-1R at the nexus between oxidative damage and mitochondrial function and a connection between colitis and colorectal cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the biological role of growth arrest special 5 (GAS5) in the radio sensitivity of cervical cancer (CC). Methods: The expressions of GAS5, miR-106b and immediate early response 3 (IER3) were detected in CC tissues and CC cell lines. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays were performed to test the interaction of GAS5 and miR-106b. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the regulatory relationship between miR-106b and IER3. The nude mouse model of CC was established for verifying the effects of GAS5 on the resistance of CC to radiation therapy in vivo. Results: GAS5 and IER3 were low expressed in the radio-resistant human CC tissues and SiHa cells, while miR-106b expression was highly expressed. Overexpression of IER3 or GAS5 enhanced radio-sensitivity in SiHa cells, while knockdown of IER3 or GAS5 decreased radio-sensitivity in ME180 cells. Moreover, GAS5 served as a miR-106b sponge, and miR-106b negatively regulated IER3 expression. Besides, GAS5 could regulate IER3 expression through miR-106b, and GAS5 enhanced the radio-sensitivity in CC cells through inhibiting miR-106b both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Overexpression of GAS5 enhanced the sensitivity of CC cells to radiation treatment via up-regulating IER3 through miR-106b. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The Inhibitor of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Kinase Subunit Epsilon (IKKε) is an oncogenic protein that is up-regulated in various types of human cancers, including breast tumors. This kinase regulates diverse processes associated with malignant progression including proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. To delve into the molecular mechanisms regulated by this kinase we performed RNA-seq and network analysis of breast cancer cells overexpressing IKKε. We found that the TNF/NF-κB cascade was clearly enriched, and in accordance, NF-κB pathway inhibition in these cells resulted in a decreased expression of IKKε target genes. Interestingly, we also found an enrichment of a mammary stemness functional pathway. Upregulation of IKKε led to an increase of a stem CD44+/CD24 −/low population accompanied by a high expression of stem markers such as ALDH1A3, NANOG, and KLF4 and with an increased clonogenic ability and mammosphere formation capacity. These results were corroborated with in vivo dilution assays in zebrafish embryos which showed a significant increase in the number of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). Finally, we found that Triple-Negative breast tumors, which are enriched in CSCs, display higher levels of IKKε than other breast tumors, supporting the association of this kinase with the stem phenotype. In conclusion, our results highlight the role of IKKε kinase in the regulation of the stem cell phenotype in breast cancer cells, as assessed by expression, functional and in vivo assays. These results add to the potential use of this kinase as a therapeutic target in this neoplasia. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A gastric cancer angiogenesis marker peptide, GX1, is promising to be a desirable ligand for anti-angiogenesis targeted drug of gastric cancer treatment. In this study, GX1 was utilized to fabricate a multifunctional vascular targeting docetaxel (DCT)-loaded nanoparticle with N-deoxycholic acid glycol chitosan (DGC) as the carrier and GX1-PEG-deoxycholic acid (GPD) conjugate as the targeting ligand. The mean size of obtained GX1-DGC-DCT was 150.9 nm with a narrow size distribution and their shape was spherical with smooth surface texture. The in vitro drug release test revealed a sustained release manner and an acid pH could accelerate the release compared with the neutral pH. Furthermore, GX1-DGC-DCT showed stronger cytotoxicity against co-cultured gastric cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (co-HUVEC) than DCT within 100 μM. In addition, GX1 efficiently enhanced the cellular uptake of nanoparticles in co-HUVEC cells as confirmed by confocal fluorescence scanning microscopy. Moreover, in vivo delivery of GX1-DGC-DCT was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in SGC791 tumor-bearing mice with tumor inhibition rate (TIR) of 67.05% and no weight loss of mice was observed. The anti-tumor effects were further confirmed by H&E and TUNEL analysis. Therefore, this new drug delivery system represents a potential strategy for gastric cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Tubulin is the primary target of an ever growing number of natural, semisynthetic and synthetic products as potential anticancer agents. The mechanisms of interaction of these molecules with tubulin are varied. These drug classes have shown to inhibit effectively several cancer types with IC 50 from midmicromolar to low nanomolar concentrations. However, some limiting obstacles still remain, such as the development of multidrug resistance and cytotoxicity.

    "Abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the major preoperative treatment of breast cancer (BC) with negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and the efficacy of NAC and the optimization of regimen are under intensive research. The current study aimed to define the predictive biomarkers for paclitaxel (PTX) response in NAC of HER2-negative BC. Data from GSE25065, GSE26065, GSE41998, as well as drug sensitivity data of breast and ovarian cancer cell line from NCI60, were used. Through logistic regression, COX regression, and correlation analysis with bootstrapping, we found that four genes (CDK8, FAM64A, MARC2, and OCEL1) were associated with drug sensitivity of PTX. The four gene “≥3” model had the best classification accuracy. Subgroup analysis found that the model performed well in the hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative subgroup and did not perform well in the triple-negative subgroup. Decision curve analysis showed that the model could enhance the predictive effect of clinical features. Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis, network analysis showed that these genes may be related to the cell cycle, mitosis and other pathways. The current study demonstrated the promising potential of the novel four-gene signature as a predictive biomarker for pathological complete response of HER2-negative BC patients and indicated the drug sensitivity of PTX. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Arsenic is a confirmed human lung carcinogen with estrogenic activity. There are gender differences in the incidence of lung cancer. Estrogen receptors (ER) play an important role in the process of the development of lung cancer. In order to understand the gender difference effects of ER during carcinogenesis of lung induced by arsenic, the effects of arsenic and estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI182780) on expression levels of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB/P65) in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) from different sex ICR fetal mice lung were detected. Results showed that arsenic increased the expression levels of mRNA and protein of ERβ ERK1/2 and NF-κB/P65, and ICI182780 inhibited the increase. Furthermore, there remains a gender difference in these changes. To summarize, the observations here strongly suggested that estrogen receptor and its mediated signal pathway molecules might have critical roles of the gender difference of incidence of lung cancer in arsenic induced. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as important biomarkers of cancer progression. Here, we proposed to develop a lncRNA-based signature with a prognostic value for colorectal cancer (CRC) overall survival (OS). Through mining microarray datasets, we analyzed the lncRNA expression profiles of 122 patients with CRC from Gene Expression Omnibus. Associations between lncRNA and CRC OS were firstly evaluated through univariate Cox regression analysis. A random survival forest method was applied for further screening of the lncRNA signature, which resulted in eight lncRNAs, including PEG3-AS1, LOC100505715, MINCR, DBH-AS1, LINC00664, FAM224A, LOC642852, and LINC00662. Combination of the eight lncRNAs weighted by their multivariate Cox regression coefficients formed a prognostic signature, through which, we could divide the 122 patients with CRC into two subgroups with significantly different OS. Good robustness of the lncRNA signature's prognostic value was verified through an independent data set consisting of 55 patients with CRC. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis indicated the potential association between high prognostic value and oxygen metabolism-related processes. This result should indicate that lncRNAs could be a useful signature for CRC prognosis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, the role of lncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still elusive and poorly understood. In the current study, our team conducted extensive experiments to identify the role of long intergenic nonprotein coding (LINC01296) on NSCLC tumorigenesis. The results illustrated that the elevated LINC01296 expression in NSCLC tissue specimens and cell lines were closely correlated with the poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC. Functional studies revealed that LINC01296 knockdown silenced by small interfering RNAs inhibited proliferation, accelerated apoptosis in vitro, and impaired tumor growth in vivo. Mechanical studies showed that INC01296 harbored miR-598, acting as a microRNA “sponge.” Besides, miR-598 targeted the 3′-UTR of Twist1. Interestingly, transcription factor Twist1 could bind with the promoter of INC01296 and activate its transcriptional level. In summary, we conclude that INC01296/miR-598/Twist1 constitutes a positive feedback loop to promote the tumorigenesis of NSCLC, providing a novel insight and a valuable therapeutic strategy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "MM-302 is an anti-HER2 antibody-targeted pegylated liposomal doxorubicin designed to deliver doxorubicin specifically to HER2-expressing solid tumors. The delivery and activity of MM-302 were evaluated in orthotopic, transgenic, and intravenous breast cancer models expressing varying levels of HER2 that metastasize to some of the most common sites of dissemination for breast cancer, namely, lung, liver, and brain. Metastatic burden was quantified by gross evaluation, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and bioluminescent imaging. Liposome delivery was quantified by IHC and ex vivo fluorescent imaging. Unlike its non-targeted counterpart, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), MM-302 showed activity at controlling both primary and metastatic tumor burden in all models tested. The effect of HER2-targeting was greatest in the lung where lymphatic vessel density and MM-302 delivery were highest. Our data indicate that the therapeutic advantage of actively targeting a nanoliposome with an antibody is influenced by both target expression and the tumor microenvironment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cellular senescence is a permanent state of cell cycle arrest that occurs in proliferating cells subjected to different stresses. Senescence is, therefore, a cellular defense mechanism that pre-vents the cells to acquire an unnecessary damage. The senescent state is accompanied by a failure to re-enter the cell cycle in response to mitogenic stimuli, an enhanced secretory phenotype and resistance to cell death. Senescence takes place in several tissues during different physiological and pathological processes such as tissue remodeling, injury, cancer, and aging. Although senescence is one of the causative processes of aging and it is responsible of aging-related disorders, senescent cells can also play a positive role. In embryogenesis and tissue remodeling, senescent cells are required for the proper development of the embryo and tissue repair. In cancer, senescence works as a potent barrier to prevent tumorigenesis. Therefore, the identification and characterization of key features of senescence, the induction of senescence in cancer cells, or the elimination of senescent cells by pharmacological interventions in aging tissues is gaining consideration in several fields of research. Here, we describe the known key features of senescence, the cell-autonomous, and noncell-autonomous regulators of senescence, and we attempt to discuss the functional role of this fundamental process in different contexts in light of the development of novel therapeutic targets. © 2019 the American Physiological Society.",

    "Abstract": "Combination chemotherapy by means of two or more drugs is prone to suppressing or discouraging the inception of multidrug resistance, exploiting the fact that diverse drugs act in different points of the cellular cycle of amplifying tumor cells. For example, the combination of gemcitabine (GMC) with quercetin (QCT) showed a synergistic effect in inhibiting the migration of pancreatic cancer cells. Consequently, herein GMC and QCT have been loaded within biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), externally decorated with hyaluronic acid (HA; viz., PPHA NPs), which plays a major role in drug targeting to tumors due to its ability to specifically interact with CD44 receptor, that is overexpressed in many tumors. The produced HA-decorated NPs loaded with GMC and QCT showed an improved cytotoxicity and cellular uptake toward two cell lines of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, namely Mia-PaCa-2 and PANC-1, compared with both the bare drugs and the drugs loaded in NPs which do not expose HA on the surface. HA-decorated NPs were also able to improve the anti-inflammatory properties of QCT, therefore leading to a decrease of interleukin cellular levels in both cell lines, preliminarily stimulated with lipopolysaccharides. This result is of special interest also considering the crucial role of interleukins in progression, metastatic processes, and drug resistance of human pancreas cancer cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The outcome for patients with ovarian cancer (OC) is poor because of drug resistance. Therefore, identification of factors that affect drug resistance and prognosis in OC is needed. In the present study, we identified 131 genes significantly dysregulated in 90 platinum-resistant OC tissues compared with 197 sensitive tissues, of which 30 were significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS; n = 16), overall survival (OS; n = 6), or both (n = 8) in 489 OC patients of the The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. Of these 30 genes, 17 were significantly upregulated and 13 were downregulated in the 90 resistant tissues, and with one exception, all of the up-/downregulated genes in resistant tissues were predictors of shorter DFS or/and OS. LAX1, MECOM, and PDIA4 were independent risk factors for DFS, and KLF1, SLC7A11, and PDIA4 for OS; combining these genes provided more accurate predictions for DFS and OS than any of the genes used individually. We further verified downregulation of PDIA4 protein in 51 specimens of patients with OC (24 drug resistant’s and 27 sensitive’s), which confirmed that downregulated PDIA4 predicted DFS and OS. PDIA4 also consistently predicted OS in a larger sample of 1656 patients with OC. These 30 genes, particularly the PDIA4, could be therapeutic targets or biomarkers for managing OC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to deeply analyze the application of DWI and DCE-MRI imaging in breast cancer, the correlation between the imaging characteristics of DWI and DCE-MRI and the molecular subtypes and prognostic factors of breast cancer was studied. Firstly, DWI and DCE-MRI scans of all patients before interventional therapy were performed, and relevant information of the subjects was introduced in turn. Secondly, molecular subtypes were determined according to immunohistochemical results and gene amplification. Siemens 3.0 T post-processing workstation was used for image post-processing. The time signal curve (TIC), early enhancement rate (EER) and ADC values were measured, morphological characteristics were recorded, and the correlation between each image feature and molecular subtypes, prognostic factors (tumor size, pathological grade, lymph node metastasis, ER, PR, HER2, Ki67) was analyzed. The results showed that parameters such as ADC value, EER, lobulation sign, burr sign, enhancement way and TIC type were correlated with prognostic factors and molecular subtypes. And Bayesian model discriminant analysis showed that the above imaging parameters couldn’t well predict the expression of immunohistochemical factors and molecular subtypes. However, the above characteristics had a good effect on the prediction of pathological grade, with a false diagnosis rate of 9.69%. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "This article further develops the literature on the local consequences of natural resource extraction by using newly collected county data from 1964 to 1988 to capture both short- and long-term mortality effects. The article identifies the net impact on mortality and provides evidence that throughout the majority of its distribution, increases in extractive industry activity are associated with small decreases in total and cancer mortality on a year-to-year basis. However, increases in extractive activity are associated with net increases in county-level total, cancer, and infant mortality in the long run, and at very high levels of activity, and are strongly impacted by coal mining activity. Additional analysis is required regarding the short- and long-run mechanisms, but the paper provides preliminary evidence that extractive activity and local community pollution are positively related. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "YWHAZ has been suggested to as an oncogene in various human malignancies, including non-small–cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our study presents more evidence to confirm the clinical significance and biological function of YWHAZ in NSCLC. In our results, YWHAZ was upregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues and lung adenocarcinoma tissues through analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and confirmed high levels of YWHAZ messenger RNA and protein in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues and lung adenocarcinoma tissues through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, YWHAZ overexpression was correlated with advanced clinical stage, more lymph node metastasis and present distant metastasis in NSCLC patients. Survival analysis indicated that high level of YWHAZ protein expression was associated with short overall survival time in NSCLC patients, and YWHAZ expression was independent prognostic factors for overall survival in NSCLC patients. Moreover, Silencing of YWHAZ expression represses NSCLC cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, YWHAZ is a credible prognostic biomarker, and may be a therapeutic target in NSCLC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Salinomycin is a polyether ionophore antibiotic having anti-tumorigenic property in various types of cancer. Elevated thymidine phosphorylase (TP) levels, a key enzyme in the pyrimidine nucleoside salvage pathway, are associated with an aggressive disease phenotype and poor prognoses. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that is responsible for the stabilization and maturation of many oncogenic proteins. In this study, we report whether Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG could enhance salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells through modulating TP expression in two non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, A549 and H1975. We found that salinomycin increased TP expression in a MKK3/6-p38 MAPK activation manner. Knockdown of TP using siRNA or inactivation of p38 MAPK by pharmacological inhibitor SB203580 enhanced the cytotoxic and growth inhibition effects of salinomycin. In contrast, enforced expression of MKK6E (a constitutively active form of MKK6) reduced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of salinomycin. Moreover, Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG enhanced cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of salinomycin in NSCLC cells, which were associated with down-regulation of TP expression and inactivation of p38 MAPK. Together, the Hsp90 inhibition induced TP down-regulation involved in enhancing the salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity in A549 and H1975 cells. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems such as floating spheroids (FSs) and floating tumorspheres (FTs) are widely used as tumor models of chemoresistance. FTs are considered to be enriched in cancer stem-like cells (CS-LCs). In this study, we used cancer cell lines (lung H460, prostate LnCAP, and breast MCF-7) able to form FSs under anchorage-independent conditions and compared with cell lines (prostate PC3 and breast MDA-MB-231) that cannot form FSs under similar conditions. Independent of their ability to form FTs all cell lines growing under anchorage-independent conditions become highly resistant to obatoclax, colchicine, and hydroxyurea. We used anti-E-cadherin antibody (that blocked the formation of FSs) and demonstrated that floating LnCAP cells showed similar chemoresistance regardless of the formation of spheroids. Our results demonstrate that the development of chemoresistance is not because of the formation of a complex 3D structure and/or enrichment of CS-LCs but is likely the result of cell detachment per se and their ability to survive under anchorage-independent conditions. We propose that FSs and FTs could be useful models to study chemoresistance of cancer cells associated with cell detachment (e.g., circulating tumor cells) but they may not be representative of other types of chemoresistance that arise in vivo in attached cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Mounting evidence has demonstrated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dysregulated and implicated in the occurrence and development of a wide range of human malignancies. LINC00461, a novel cancer-related lncRNA, has been reported to be highly expressed and serve as oncogene in glioma; however, its biological role in breast cancer (BC) remains obscure. This study aimed to explore the role of LINC00461 in BC and elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms involved. In the current study, LINC00461 was found to be significantly upregulated in both BC tissues and cell lines. Besides, we found that high LINC00461 expression was associated with TNM stage and differentiation. Furthermore, functional studies demonstrated that LINC00461 expedited BC cell migration and invasion. Notably, LINC00461 was observed to enhance the expression of vimentin and zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox factor 1, suppress the expression of E-cadherin, and promote the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AKT signaling pathways. Mechanical investigations revealed that LINC00461 positively modulated integrin β3 (ITGB3) expression as miR-30a-5p sponge in BC cells. Taken together, LINC00461 exerts an oncogenic role in BC through miR-30a-5p/ITGB3 axis. Our data indicate that LINC00461 may be used to be a novel candidate therapeutic target and a valuable diagnostic biomarker for BC. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Hybrid composite bioparticles modified with stable and radioactive gold nanoparticles were prepared via reduction of tetrachloroauric acid within Lactobacillus rhamnosus cells. The resulting biocomposite material was characterized using a number of physicochemical techniques, including microscopic, spectroscopic and thermal methods. The bacterial particles act as a type of template for gold deposition. Gold nanoparticles of approximately 3.7 nm diameter are formed and are uniformly distributed within the bacterial cell, including its hydrogel outer shell. For radioactive gold-198, the β− radiation emitted from the biocomposite particles can be used for therapeutic purposes, as demonstrated in vitro in cancer cell cultures. The antitumor activity can be further enhanced by incorporation of doxorubicin, a cytostatic drug, within composite particles. The cell viability data indicate the considerable synergistic effect of β− radiation and doxorubicin on breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The antitumor action of the biocomposite particles is very promising for new anticancer therapies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

The three-dimensional (3D) microporous scaffold provides the possibility of generating more reliable preclinical models to increase the efficacy of cancer treatments. The physical properties of a microporous cellulosic scaffold were evaluated. The cellulosic scaffold was biocompatible and had a highly porous network with appropriate pore size, swelling rate, and stiffness of cancer cell cultures. Cellulosic scaffolds were compared with 2D polystyrene for the culture of HepG2 and Huh7 human HCC cells. Cellulosic scaffolds promoted tumor spheroid formation. Cells cultured on scaffolds were more resistant to chemotherapy drugs and showed upregulation of EpCAM and Oct4. The migration ability of HCC cells cultured on scaffolds was significantly greater than that of cells grown in 2D cultures as evidenced by the downregulation of E-cadherin. In addition, the proportion of CD44+/CD133+ HCC cancer stem cells (CSCs) was significantly greater in cells cultured on scaffolds than in those grown in 2D cultures. These findings suggest that cellulosic scaffolds effectively mimic the in vivo tumor behavior and may serve as a platform for the study of anticancer therapeutics and liver CSCs. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In the last three decades, many new cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) were developed that exhibited enhanced cell selectivity. Thus, we aimed to validate the tumor cell selectivity of peptides from this new generation, namely fragments mini-crotamine and mini-maurocalcine. Both of these peptides are derived from venoms. Furthermore, we studied an analog of the classical CPP HIV-TAT(47-57) with alternating chirality of Arg residues. To allow covalent coupling of cargoes or fluorophores, a cysteine residue was introduced to the N-terminus of the synthesized peptides. The therapeutic antibody trastuzumab conjugated to different fluorescent dyes was used for internalization studies. Comparison of uptake efficiencies revealed that CPPs of the new generation are in contrast to MPG-peptides, nearly unable to internalize the noncovalently formed complexes with trastuzumab. Interestingly, the fluorescent derivative of the crotamine fragment was mainly observed in a subpopulation of breast cancer cells, whereas it was homogenously distributed in fibrosarcoma, colon cancer, and noncancerous endothelia cells. Thus, the fluorescent crotamine fragment reported herein is a potent theranostic tool for image-guided applications. This peptide can be used to pinpoint the level of heterogeneity present within tumors and aid in the generation of therapeutics that target heterogenic subpopulations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising target for the diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer. In this report, a NOTA-conjugated precursor, NOTA-PSMA (also named PSMA-BCH), was synthesized by peptide synthesizer with the chemical purity over 95%. 68 Ga-PSMA-BCH was obtained by radiolabeling NOTA-PSMA with 68 GaCl 3 with &gt;99% radiochemical purity and 59–74 GBq/μmol specific activity. In vitro and in vivo study of 68 Ga-PSMA-BCH showed high stability, high uptake in PSMA-expressing cells and tumor, fast clearance and low non-target uptake. 22Rv1 tumors were clearly observed in micro-PET images of and showed good retention. Compared with 68 Ga-PSMA-617, 68 Ga-PSMA-BCH showed comparable tumor uptake and tumor-background ratios. Indicating 68 Ga-PSMA-BCH is a promising candidate for prostate cancer imaging and worthy of further clinical investigations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Propofol is a popular anesthetic agent, with potent anti-tumor activity against many cancers. The objective of this study was to explore the potential effect of propofol on papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in vitro. Methods: Human PTC cell lines TPC-1 and IHH-4 were treated by propofol. ANRIL expression vector (pc-ANRIL) was transfected into TPC-1 cells to overexpress the expression of ANRIL. CCK-8, BrdU assay, transwell assay, flow cytometry and Western blot were performed to evaluate cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. The expression changes of ANRIL were detected by RT-qPCR. Results: Propofol with a concentration of 6 μg/mL significantly reduced TPC-1 and IHH-4 cells proliferation and migration, and significantly induced apoptosis. However, 6 μg/mL of propofol had no significant impacts on the proliferation and apoptosis of normal human thyroid follicular epithelial Nthy-ori 3–1 cells. Meanwhile, the expression of ANRIL in TPC-1 cells was down-regulated by propofol. The anti-tumor activity of propofol was attenuated when ANRIL was overexpressed. Additionally, propofol blocked Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways in an ANRIL-dependent fashion. Conclusion: Our findings suggested the in vitro anti-tumor potential of propofol in PTC. One possible mechanism involved in the anti-tumor activity was preliminary revealed: propofol down-regulated the expression of ANRIL, and thus blocking Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Hepatocarcinoma is one of the most lethal cancers, leading to a 5-year survival rate as low as 30% due to recurrence and metastasis. The treatment of liver cancer includes surgery and medication, of which, the former is more effective. However, surgical resection is applicable in less than 40% of patients. Therefore, it is imperative to find effective medication options for liver cancer therapy. Methods: In this study, we found that two natural products, geraniol and lupeol, had antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on the hepatocarcinoma cell lines SMMC7721 and HepG2. We also detected a lower expression level of Bcl-2 and upregulation of BAX and caspase in the presence of geraniol and lupeol. Results: Furthermore, geraniol or lupeol also altered the phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, P38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, suggesting involvement in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Conclusions: This study provided direct evidence to support the effect of geraniol and lupeol in hepatocarcinoma cell growth and apoptosis, which indicated the potential application of these two natural products in anti–liver cancer therapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Dysregulation of miR-543 has been implicated to play crucial roles in various human cancers. However, the function of miR-543 involved in cervical cancer (CC) progress remains largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to explore the potential role of miR-543 and the underlying mechanisms in human CC. In this study, we found that miR-543 was significantly downregulated in 69 CC tissue samples and cell lines when compared to adjacent normal tissues and cell line. Decreased miR-543 was closely correlated with poor clinicopathological parameters including larger tumor size, late FIGO stage and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of miR-543 in CC cell lines remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration, caused cell cycle arrest, promoted apoptosis in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo, whereas miR-543 inhibitor showed the opposite effect. Dual-luciferase assay validated that 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) was a direct binding site of miR-543. Rescue experiments showed that restoration of TRPM7 expression partially reversed the miR-543-mediated inhibition of proliferation and invasion in CC cells. Further studies confirmed that P13K/AKT and p38/MAPK signaling was involved in miR-543/TRPM7 axis mediated CC progression. Thus, these findings demonstrated the tumor suppressor role of miR-543 on CC progression, which might serve as a potential biomarker for CC diagnosis and therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Localization of the cancerous region as well as classification of the type of the cancer is highly inter-linked with each other. However, investigation towards existing approaches depicts that these problems are always iindividually solved where there is still a big research gap for a generalized solution towards addressing both the problems. Therefore, the proposed manuscript presents a simple, novel, and less-iterative computational model that jointly address the localization-classification problems taking the case study of early diagnosis of breast cancer. The proposed study harnesses the potential of simple bio-inspired optimization technique in order to obtained better local and global best outcome to confirm the accuracy of the outcome. The study outcome of the proposed system exhibits that proposed system offers higher accuracy and lower response time in contrast with other existing classifiers that are freqently witnessed in existing approaches of classification in medical image process.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: p38 MAPK signaling molecules plays a dual role in cancer, both progression and suppression. Elevated expression of p38α was reported in lung cancer tissue in rat model. Our objective was to explore the concentration of all 4 isoforms of p38MAPK in serum of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Material and methods: The blood samples were collected from 77 NSCLC patients, 52 ethically matched healthy controls and 18 follow up patients were collected as some patients expired and some discontinued the treatment. The concentration of all isoforms of p38 (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) were evaluated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology. Result: The levels of all isoforms of serum p38 were significantly elevated at pre-therapy compare to control. Only p38α expression was significantly associated with tumor stage and its expression reduced after treatment which is then validated by western blot. However, no changes were observed in other isoforms after therapy. Conclusion: Our study revealed that, p38α is more efficient among all the isoform to predict the disease accurately and it can be concluded that p38 MAPK may be used as diagnostic as well as prognostic marker of NSCLC disease. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "A Pt(IV) prodrug of cisplatin containing a glutathione s-transferase (GSTs) inhibitor 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol (NBDHEX), complex 1, was designed and studied aiming to overcome cisplatin-resistance and reduce its toxicity by inhibiting GSTs overexpressed in cancer cells. The complex could be reduced to release its active Pt(II) species and axial ligand in the presence of ascorbic acid. In cytotoxicity study, complex 1 showed more potent anticancer activity than cisplatin and NBDHEX against all the tested cancer cells, especially toward cisplatin resistant A549/DDP cells with a resistance factor value of 0.37. By effectively inhibiting GSTs, complex 1 was found to be able to promote higher platinum uptake and cause more severe DNA damage in both A549 cells and A549/DDP cells as compared with cisplatin. Further mechanism study indicated that it could trigger cell death via an apoptotic pathway. In vivo tests on A549 xenograft tumor mice model showed that complex 1 presented higher tumor inhibiting rate and lower toxicity than cisplatin as well. In all, the Pt(IV) prodrug has potential to be developed as an anticancer agent. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major therapeutic obstacle in the treatment of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). As an oxidative stress responsive transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates the expression of cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 not only plays a critical role in chemoprevention, but also contributes to chemoresistance. In this study, we found that digoxin markedly reversed drug resistance of gemcitabine by inhibiting Nrf2 signaling in SW1990/Gem and Panc-1/Gem cells. Further research revealed that digoxin regulated Nrf2 at transcriptional level. In in vivo study, we found that digoxin and gemcitabine in combination inhibited tumor growth more substantially when compared with gemcitabine treatment alone in SW1990/Gem-shControl cells-derived xenografts. In the meantime, SW1990/Gem-shNrf2 cells-derived xenografts responded to gemcitabine and combination treatment similarly, suggesting that digoxin sensitized gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine, which was Nrf2 dependent. These results demonstrated that digoxin might be used as a promising adjuvant sensitizer to reverse chemoresistance of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine via inhibiting Nrf2 signaling. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Including children in medical conversations is considered the standard of care for children with cancer. However, previous qualitative research has raised concerns about how the child’s presence impacts the parent’s communication experience. The current study examines the frequency and impact of child presence during a serious medical conversation on the parent’s communication experience in pediatric oncology. Methods: Three hundred sixty parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer completed questionnaires assessing the child’s presence during the initial conversation with the oncologist about diagnosis and treatment and parental communication experiences. Primary oncologists completed a survey question about the child’s prognosis. Results: Sixty-one percent of children were present during the initial conversation, with lowest rates among children aged 3–6 (44%) and 7–12 (44%). Child presence was not associated with parents’ reports that they received prognostic information (p = 0.20), high-quality information (p = 0.19), or high-quality communication about the child’s cancer (p = 1.0). Discussion: The parent’s communication experience is not diminished by the choice to include the child. Given the bioethical imperative to include children in conversations about serious illness whenever possible, this concern should not be used to exclude children, but rather to give parents additional time of their own when needed to fully process decisions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Chemotherapy is the usual treatment, but entails side effects. Although lactic acid bacteria (LAB) ameliorate CRC, the effects of LAB-fermented skim milk are unknown. Thus, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented skim milk (NTU 101FM) in combination with chemotherapy on CRC, and its effect on chemotherapeutic side effects in vivo. NTU 101FM + chemotherapy treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis compared to chemotherapy alone via regulating vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloprotein-9, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 levels. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in the tumor, intestine, and serum were significantly controlled by NTU 101FM compared to chemotherapy alone. In CRC mice, NTU 101FM significantly suppressed increases in spleen weight and inflammation-related factors induced by chemotherapy. These findings indicate that NTU 101FM potentially improves the side effects and efficiency of chemotherapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Natural carbohydrate polymer-based nanoparticles have great biocompatibility that is required for the safe delivery of various drugs including nucleic acid therapeutics. Herein, we designed curdlan-based nanoparticles for cancer cell targeted delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA). iRGD peptide conjugated 6-amino-6-deoxy curdlan specifically delivered siRNA to integrin expressing cancer cells. Incubation of cancer cells with free iRGD peptide competitively blocked cellular uptake of the iRGD functionalized curdlan nanoparticles. Chloroquine but not nystatin inhibited cellular uptake of iRGD functionalized curdlan nanoparticles, indicating that the iRGD peptide conjugated curdlan nanoparticles were internalized through the receptor (clathrin)-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, a disease related gene Plk1 was substantially knocked down by siRNA carried by 6AC-iRGD nanoparticles in HepG2 cells. Our data suggested that iRGD functionalized curdlan may provide a biocompatible carrier for siRNA delivery. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Increasing reports indicate that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are very important regulators in human diseases, including cancers. In bladder cancer (BC), several circRNAs have been reported to be involved in tumor progressions, such as circ-ITCH and circTCF25. However, the functions of most circRNAs in BC still remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel circRNA termed as circ-VANGL1 by bioinformatics analysis. We found that circ-VANGL1 was highly expressed in BC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, we showed that circ-VANGL1 could serve as a prognostic marker for patients with BC. Through functional experiments, we found that circ-VANGL1 knockdown significantly suppressed BC cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion in vitro. Besides, circ-VANGL1 silence inhibited BC cell propagation in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified circ-VANGL1 as a sponge of miR-605-3p which targeted VANGL1 in BC cells. Through repressing miR-605-3p availability, circ-VANGL1 contributes to VANGL1 expression, consequently leading to BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Taken together, our study demonstrated circ-VANGL1/miR-605-3p/VANGL1 as a novel essential signaling pathway involved in BC progression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial has shown atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer could significantly prolong overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung from an American perspective. Materials and methods: Basic medical information was derived from the double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (IMpower133, NCT02763579). A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of small-cell lung cancer, including three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death. Utilities and costs were obtained from published resources. Sensitivity analyses were applied to explore the impact of essential variables. Results: Treatment with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy was estimated to increase costs by $52,881compared with chemotherapy alone, with a gain of 0.10 quality adjusted life years (QALYs), leading to an incremental cost-effective ratio of $528,810 per QALY. The cost of PFS state and atezolizumab were the most influential factors to the model. Conclusion: The combination of atezolizumab, carboplatin and etoposide is not a cost-effective choice in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC from an American perspective. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A phytochemical investigation to obtain bioactive substances as lead compounds or agents for cancer led to the obtainment of six new clerodane diterpenoids, designated as kurzipenes A–F (1–6), from the leaves of Casearia kurzii. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of NMR spectroscopic data analysis and the absolute configurations were confirmed by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. The cytotoxic activities of compounds 1–6 were evaluated against human lung cancer A549 cell line, human cervical cancer Hela cell line, and human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line. Most diterpenoids showed potent cytotoxicities against the three selected cancer cell lines. The preliminary mechanism studies revealed that the most active compound 2, with an IC 50 value of 5.3 μM against Hela cells, induced apoptosis and arrested the Hela cell cycle at the G0/G1 stage to exert cytotoxic effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: This study documents the utilization and efficacy of proton beam therapy (PBT) in western patients with localized unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods and methods: Forty-six patients with HCC, Child-Pugh class of A or B, no prior radiotherapy history, and ECOG performance status 0–2 received PBT at our institution from 2007 to 2016. Radiographic control within the PBT field (local control, LC) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from the start of PBT. Results: Most (83%) patients had Child-Pugh class A. Median tumor size was 6 cm (range, 1.5–21.0 cm); 22% of patients had multiple tumors and 28% had tumor vascular thrombosis. Twenty-five (54%) patients received prior treatment. Median biologically effective dose (BED) was 97.7 GyE (range, 33.6–144 GyE) administered in 15 fractions. Actuarial 2-year LC and OS rates were 81% and 62% respectively; median OS was 30.7 months. Out-of-field intrahepatic failure was the most common site of disease progression. Patients receiving BED ≥90 GyE had a significantly better OS than those receiving BED <90 GyE (49.9 vs. 15.8 months, p = 0.037). A trend toward 2-year LC improvement was observed in patients receiving BED ≥90 GyE compared with those receiving BED <90 GyE (92% vs. 63%, p = 0.096). On multivariate analysis, higher BED (p = 0.023; hazard ratio = 0.308) significantly predicted improved OS. Six (13%) patients experienced acute grade 3 toxicity. Conclusions: High-dose PBT is associated with high rates of LC and OS for unresectable HCC. Dose escalation may further improve outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Early palliative care is recommended for cancer patients. However, palliative care consults (PCC) are often delayed in Lebanon. The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with timing of PCC and their impact on the place of death. Methods: This is a retrospective, single institution, study conducted at Hotel Dieu de France University Hospital in Lebanon. The clinical and demographic characteristics of oncology patients who received PCC were obtained. Cox and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the factors determining the time to first PCC and location of death, respectively. Results: Two hundred and ten patients were included in our analyses with a median age of 69 years (range 22–92 years). The median survival times were: overall survival 18.7 months, time to first PCC 17.9 months, and survival post-PCC 0.6 months. Among patients who were followed-up at home, the median time spent at home was 0.6 months. Late PCC were associated with a childless status (HR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.37–0.86, p = 0.007), awareness of the diagnosis (HR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.45–0.91, p = 0.013), and lack of palliative home care (HR = 0.42, 95%CI = 0.25–0.65, p < 0.001). Older patients (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.01–1.05, p = 0.026) and those who had been followed up at home during the PCC (OR = 160.56, 95%CI = 21.39–1205.50, p < 0.001) were significantly more likely to have died at home as opposed to the hospital. Discussion: Cancer patients often receive PCC only shortly before their death. PCC for Lebanese cancer patients were found to be significantly delayed in patients that are childless, knowledgeable of their diagnosis, and lack home palliative care. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) trial showed the survival benefit for prostate radiotherapy in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with a low metastatic burden. The result raises the next question whether additional radiotherapy to metastatic sites could improve the survival in those with a low metastatic burden. Methods: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of prostate-directed radiotherapy (PDRT) with or without metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDRT) in newly diagnosed oligometastatic patients who underwent combination of high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapy. Forty patients with bone metastasis and node positive prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Of these, 22 (55%), 3 (7%), and 15 (38%) patients had N1M0, M1a, and M1b, respectively. Eighteen patients (45%) received MDRT to all metastatic sites. All patients initially underwent ≧6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. Oligometastatic disease was defined as presence of five or fewer metastatic lesions. Median follow-up period was 62.5 months. Results: Of the 40 patients, the 5-year castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival rate and cancer-specific survival was 64.4% and 87.9%, respectively. Pre- or post-treatment predictive value including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis ≥20 ng/mL, Gleason grade group 5, positive biopsy core rate ≥51%, PSA nadir level of ≥0.02 ng/mL after the radiotherapy, and no MDRT were significantly associated with progression to CRPC. Patients with MDRT had significantly higher probability of achieving a PSA level of <0.02 ng/mL than those without the therapy (88.8% vs 54.5%, P = 0.0354) and consequently had a better CRPC-free survival than those without the therapy (HR 0.319, 95%CI: 0.116-0.877). Comparing PDRT alone, PDRT with MDRT did not significantly increase the incidences of genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities. Conclusions: This single-institutional study revealed the feasibility of combining prostate brachytherapy and MDRT for newly diagnosed oligometastatic prostate cancer. This combined approach has potential to prolong CRPC-free survival. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In prostate cancer, disease progression after primary treatment and subsequent androgen deprivation therapy is common. Intensification of systemic treatment is the standard of care. Recently, 68 Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging was introduced to identify oligometastatic prostate cancer patients. In this retrospective, exploratory study, we report on the efficacy of PSMA-PET-guided local ablative radiotherapy (aRT) in 15 oligometastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients, selected from our prospective institutional database and treated between 2013 and 2016. After multidisciplinary discussion, aRT was delivered with two different schedules. Androgen deprivation therapy remained unchanged. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and time to PSA progression were analysed. For comparison, individual time to PSA progression without aRT was estimated by individual PSA doubling time (PSADT). PSA response was observed in 11 patients (73%). Mean time to PSA progression or last follow-up was 17.9 mo, as opposed to 2.9 mo estimated from the PSADT without aRT (p &lt; 0.001). A relevant subset of CRPC patients had a PSA response with aRT to PET-positive lead metastases. A prospective trial is in preparation. Patient summary: In selected patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase during androgen deprivation, metastases were detected with prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography imaging. Fifteen patients with three or fewer metastases were treated with high-dose radiotherapy. Subsequently, PSA values dropped in 11 patients and in six patients no PSA progression was detected for &gt;12 mo. Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) may identify patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who benefit from metastasis-directed ablative radiotherapy. Median time to prostate-specific antigen progression after local ablative radiotherapy to one to three PET-positive lead metastases was 1.5 yr while continuing androgen deprivation. A prospective trial is ongoing. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the effects of dose escalation by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in liver-directed concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC-C HCC). Materials and methods: During 2005–2016, 637 patients with BCLC-C HCC received RT with concurrent hepatic arterial 5-fluorouracil. Patients were divided into two groups according to the biologically effective doses for a tumor (α/β = 10 Gy): <72 Gy (536 patients) and ≥72 Gy (101 patients). In each group, 128/536 (24%) and 94/101 patients (93%) used IMRT, respectively. Results: The median follow-up for patients alive at the time of analysis was 36 months (range, 6–159 months). For ≥72 Gy and <72 Gy groups, the median overall survival (OS) was 21 and 13 months, respectively (P =.002). The 1-year local failure-free survival (LFFS) were significantly higher in high-dose group (95% vs. 79%; P <.001). After propensity score matching, high-dose group still had significantly better 1-year OS (62% vs. 51%; P =.03) and 1-year LFFS (95% vs. 78%; P =.008). In the multivariate model, RT dose was an independent predictor of LFFS and OS. The surgical conversion rate was significantly higher in high-dose group (20% vs. 12%, P =.03), with substantially increased median OS among patients who underwent surgery (104 months vs. 11 months; P <.001). There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal bleeding or radiation-induced liver disease. Conclusions: In liver-directed concurrent chemoradiotherapy, radiation dose escalation by IMRT increased LFFS and OS for locally advanced BCLC-C HCC. It also increased the conversion rate to curative resection, which was attributable to increased OS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The extent of lymph node dissection (LND) in bladder cancer (BCa) patients at the time of radical cystectomy may affect oncologic outcome. Objective: To evaluate whether extended versus limited LND prolongs recurrence-free survival (RFS). Design, setting, and participants: Prospective, multicenter, phase-III trial patients with locally resectable T1G3 or muscle-invasive urothelial BCa (T2-T4aM0). Intervention: Randomization to limited (obturator, and internal and external iliac nodes) versus extended LND (in addition, deep obturator, common iliac, presacral, paracaval, interaortocaval, and para-aortal nodes up to the inferior mesenteric artery). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint was RFS. Secondary endpoints included cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), and complications. The trial was designed to show 15% advantage of 5-yr RFS by extended LND. Results and limitations: In total, 401 patients were randomized from February 2006 to August 2010 (203 limited, 198 extended). The median number of dissected nodes was 19 in the limited and 31 in the extended arm. Extended LND failed to show superiority over limited LND with regard to RFS (5-yr RFS 65% vs 59%; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84 [95% confidence interval 0.58–1.22]; p = 0.36), CSS (5-yr CSS 76% vs 65%; HR = 0.70; p = 0.10), and OS (5-yr OS 59% vs 50%; HR = 0.78; p = 0.12). Clavien grade ≥3 lymphoceles were more frequently reported in the extended LND group within 90 d after surgery. Inclusion of T1G3 tumors may have contributed to the negative study result. Conclusions: Extended LND failed to show a significant advantage over limited LND in RFS, CSS, and OS. A larger trial is required to determine whether extended compared with limited LND leads to a small, but clinically relevant, survival difference (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01215071). Patient summary: In this study, we investigated the outcome in bladder cancer patients undergoing cystectomy based on the anatomic extent of lymph node resection. We found that extended removal of lymph nodes did not reduce the rate of tumor recurrence in the expected range. In this randomized phase-III trial, extended lymph node dissection (LND) failed to show a statistically significant therapeutic advantage over limited LND in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy. The benefit from extended LND in the primary endpoint recurrence-free survival was smaller than expected. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Funding Text 1": "This trial assessing the therapeutic benefit of extended versus limited LND at the time of RC for urothelial BCa failed to show a significant improvement in the primary endpoint RFS and the secondary endpoints CSS and OS. There were survival differences between groups, but these did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. A larger trial would be required to determine whether extended compared with limited LND leads to a small, but clinically relevant, survival difference. Author contributions : Juergen E.

    "Abstract": "BRM270 is the most leading phytochemical extract that possesses potent anticancer properties. A major challenge associated with this drug is its low bioavailability and thus requires high dosages for cancer treatment. Here, we report the novel nano-synthesis of phyto-composite, BRM270 for the first time by mechanical milling method with specific modifications for enhanced cytotoxicity against HepG2 human hepatoma cancer cells. Unlike free BRM270 and other phytomedicines, BRM270 nanoparticles (BRM270 NPs) are well-dispersed and small sized (23 to 70 nm) which is believed to greatly enhanced cellular uptake. Furthermore, the acidic tumor microenvironment attracts BRM270 NPs enhancing targeted therapy while leaving normal cells less affected. The comparative cytotoxicity analysis using MTT assay among the three treatment groups, such as free BRM270, BRM270 NPs, and doxorubicin demonstrated that BRM270 NPs induced greater cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an effective drug concentration of 12 μg/ml. From FACS analysis, we observed an apoptotic cell death of 44.4% at BRM270 NPs treated cells while only 12.5% found in the free BRM270 treated cells. Further, the comparative relative expression profiling of the candidate genes were showed significant (p < 0.05) down-regulation of IL6, BCL2, p53, and MMP9 in the BRM270 NPs treated cells, compared to the free BRM270 and doxorubicin. Indeed, the genes, CASPASE 9 and BAX have shown significant (p < 0.05) upregulation in cells treated with BRM270 NPs as compared to counter treatment groups. The investigation of the signal pathways and protein-protein network associations were also carried out to elucidate the functional insights underlying anti-cancer potential of BRM270 NPs in HepG2 cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that these uniquely engineered BRM270 NPs effectively enter into the cancer cells due to its acidic microenvironment thereby inducing apoptosis and regulate the cell-proliferation in-vitro at extremely low dosages. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between sarcopenia, diagnosed by different muscle mass measurement techniques, with nutritional status and overall survival in patients with advanced cancer under palliative care. Aim: To investigate the association of sarcopenia, according to distinct muscle mass measurement methods, with nutritional status and overall survival (OS). Methods: This observational and prospective study, including 334 patients, defined sarcopenia as reduced muscle mass and strength. Muscle mass was evaluated adopting 3 different methods, mid-upper arm muscle area (MUAMA), calf circumference (CC) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMI) described by Baumgartner (1998) and adjusted for height. Strength was defined using a handgrip dynamometer and OS was established based on a 90 days follow-up after inclusion date. Kaplan-Meier curves were conducted for survival analyzes and the association between sarcopenia and OS was evaluated by Cox regression model Results: Prevalence of sarcopenia varied from 27-65% according to the method used to evaluate muscle mass. Malnutrition assessed by different parameters was significantly higher in patients with sarcopenia. Patients considered sarcopenic by MUAMA (43 versus 67 days, p<0.001), CC (44 versus 77 days, p<0.001) and ASMI (48 versus 75 days, p<0.001) had significantly lower OS compared to non-sarcopenic patients. Sarcopenia evaluated by MUAMA (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.12-2.18) and CC (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.45-2.76) showed a higher risk of mortality. Conclusion: Sarcopenia diagnosed by MUAMA and CC could predict mortality and CC proved to be the best prognostic method for estimating OS in patients with advanced cancer in palliative care. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Asians have a lower incidence of prostate cancer (PC). We compared the performance of the Prostate Health Index (PHI) for 2488 men in different ethnic groups (1688 Asian and 800 European men from 9 sites) with PSA 2–20 ng/ml and PHI test and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy results available. Of these, 1652 men had PSA 2–10 ng/ml and a normal digital rectal examination and underwent initial biopsy. The proportions of PC (Gleason ≥6) and higher-grade PC (HGPC, Gleason ≥7) across different PHI ranges were compared. The performance of PSA and PHI was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses (DCA). Among Asian men, HGPC would be diagnosed in 1.0%, 1.9%, 13%, and 30% of men using PHI thresholds of <25, 25–35, 35–55, and >55, respectively. At 90% sensitivity for HGPC (PHI >30), 56% of biopsies and 33% of Gleason 6 PC diagnoses could have been avoided. Among European men, HGPC would be diagnosed in 4.1%, 4.3%, 30%, and 34% of men using PHI thresholds of <25, 25–35, 35–55, and >55, respectively. At 90% sensitivity for HGPC (PHI >40), 40% of biopsies and 31% of Gleason 6 PC diagnoses could have been avoided. AUC and DCA confirmed the benefit of PHI over PSA. The benefit of PHI was also seen at repeat biopsy (n = 397) and for PSA 10–20 ng/ml (n = 439). PHI is effective in cancer risk stratification for both European and Asian men. However, population-specific PHI reference ranges should be used. Patient summary: The Prostate Health Index (PHI) blood test helps to identify individuals at higher risk of prostate cancer among Asian and European men, and could significantly reduce unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis of prostate cancer. Different PHI reference ranges should be used for different ethnic groups. The Prostate Health Index (PHI) test is effective in cancer risk stratification for both European and Asian men. A higher proportion of biopsies could be avoided among Asian men using PHI. An ethnic-specific reference range should be used. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Abstract": "Background: Neoadjuvant treatment improves survival for patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Recent evidence suggests that neoadjuvant chemoradiation offers no advantage over chemotherapy alone before surgical resection for adenocarcinoma histology. We sought to examine if this applies to patients with squamous cell histology. Materials and methods: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients who underwent treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus from 2004 to 2012. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy before esophagectomy were compared with those undergoing chemotherapy and radiation before surgical resection. Associations between potential covariates and treatment were analyzed using the Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards modeling results were used to assess the effect of treatment on overall survival. Relative prognosis was summarized using estimates and 95% confidence limits for the hazard ratio. Unadjusted differences in overall survival and disease-specific survival between the treatment are shown using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: A total of 902 patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy before surgical resection during the study period, with 827 receiving chemotherapy and radiation, and 75 receiving chemotherapy alone preoperatively. The 30- and 90-d mortality for patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery were 5.4% and 10.4% compared to 5.5% and 11.1% for patients who received chemotherapy alone preoperatively (P = 0.963 and P = 0.856), respectively. Median overall survival for patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation was 36.0 mo versus 40.8 mo for chemotherapy alone. The 5-y survival was 39% for the chemotherapy and radiation group and 43% for the chemotherapy group (logrank P = 0.7212). Conclusions: For patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment before planned surgical resection of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, the addition of radiation to neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not improve long-term survival and did not appear to impact short-term outcomes postoperatively. Further study with a randomized phase III trial is needed. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2)-prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) pathway promotes tumour progression. Considering evidence suggesting increased PGE 2 synthesis by BRAF mutation in tumour cells, we hypothesised that the association of tumour PTGS2 (COX-2) expression with colorectal cancer mortality might be stronger in BRAF-mutated tumours than in BRAF-wild-type tumours. Methods: Using 1708 patients, including 1200 stage I-IV colorectal carcinoma cases in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and 508 stage III colon cancer cases in a National Cancer Institute–sponsored randomised controlled trial of adjuvant therapy (CALGB/Alliance 89803), we evaluated tumour PTGS2 (COX-2) expression status using immunohistochemistry. We examined the prognostic association of PTGS2 (COX-2) expression in strata of BRAF mutation status by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to adjust for potential confounders, including disease stage, tumour differentiation, microsatellite instability status and KRAS and PIK3CA mutations. Results: In NHS and HPFS, the association of PTGS2 (COX-2) expression with colorectal cancer-specific survival differed by BRAF mutation status (P interaction = 0.0005); compared with PTGS2 (COX-2)-negative/low carcinomas, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for PTGS2 (COX-2)-high carcinomas were 2.44 (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.28) in BRAF-mutated cases and 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.65–1.04) in BRAF-wild-type cases. Differential prognostic associations of PTGS2 (COX-2) expression in strata of BRAF mutation status were similarly observed in CALGB/Alliance 89803 trial (P interaction = 0.03). Conclusions: The association of tumour PTGS2 (COX-2) expression with colorectal cancer mortality is stronger in BRAF-mutated tumours than in BRAF-wild-type tumours, supporting interactive roles of PTGS2 (COX-2) expression and BRAF mutation statuses in prognostication of patients with colorectal cancer; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT00003835. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Curcumin, the polyphenolic constituent of turmeric, has been recognized as an effective anticancer agent in the treatment of breast cancer. However, the poor bioavailability of curcumin triggers finding of new approaches for elevating its therapeutic efficiency. Purpose: We aimed to use gemini surfactant nanocarriers for curcumin in order to overcome its limitations. Study design: We investigated the in vitro characterization of gemini surfactant–curcumin (Gemini–Cur) and examined its antiproliferative & apoptotic activities on breast cancer cell lines. Methods: Gemini–Cur polymersomes were synthesized through nanoprecipitation method and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission and scanning electron microscopies, HPLC and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The anticancer effect of Gemini–Cur nanoparticles was studied on three different breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7, SkBr-3 and MDA-MB-231 through uptake kinetics, viability & cytotoxicity recordings and apoptotic assays. Furthermore, qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of apoptotic genes including p16INK4a, p14ARF, Bax and Bcl-2. Results: According to physicochemical analysis, the average particle size, zeta potential value and drug entrapment efficiency for Gemini–Cur compound were recorded as 161 ± 6.2 nm, +5.32 mV and 89.13% ± 0.93, respectively. XRD analysis also confirmed the incorporation of curcumin in gemini surfactant micelles. Regarding the enhanced cellular uptake of sphere shaped Gemini–Cur, our data showed that this nano compound suppresses cancer cell proliferation via induction of apoptosis. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Gemini–Cur could effectively upregulate the expression of p16INK4a, p14ARF and Bax, while significantly decreasing the Bcl-2 expression in these breast cancer cells. Conclusion: Our data demonstrates the great potential of gemini surfactants for efficient delivery of curcumin and subsequently, the improvement of its anticancer effect. Therefore, it is sagacious to support the idea that Gemini–Cur nano compound might have the potential to be considered as an anticancer agent. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the value of combining tumor and pelvic lymph node (PLN) characteristics on PET-CT in predicting PLN metastasis of patients with early-stage cervical cancer, specifically to further reduce the false-negative cases of diagnosis. Methods: The [18F] FDG PET-CT imaging data of 394 patients who were newly diagnosed with cervical cancer (FIGO stage, Ia-IIa) were retrospectively studied. We measured size, total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of tumor, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax, SUVmean) of tumor and lymph node (LN). Diagnostic efficiency was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. We also investigated additional CT diagnosis information in PET-negative cases. Results: Our results indicated both lymph node and tumor parameters were independent risk factors for lymphatic metastasis in early-stage cervical cancer. The diagnosis based on above meaningful parameters, we name it ‘combination diagnosis’, offered significantly higher predictive value than that based on SUV measurement alone, which the values of AUC were 0.842 and 0.784 respectively (P < 0.05). In PET-negative cases, we also found that tumor TLG, suspicious LN in lymphatic drainage pathway, long/short axis of LN ≤ 2, heterogeneity of LN significantly associated with PLN metastasis. ROC analysis showed combination diagnosis of all these parameters above produced an AUC value of 0.859 (P < 0.05, 95% CI, 0.811–0.899), which was significantly higher than either using tumor TLG alone (AUC = 0.622, Z = 3.919, P < 0.05) or indices derived from CT alone (AUC = 0.727, 0.668, 0.695. Z = 3.620, 5.356, 3.696, P < 0.05). Conclusions: We proposed a combination diagnosis method that can better predict PLN metastasis for patients with early-stage cervical cancer. In PET-negative cases, combination diagnosis of TLG of tumor and CT indicators also produced improved prediction by reducing false-negative cases of diagnosis. This combination diagnosis approach has significant implications in cervical cancer patient management and treatment planning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The immune system seems to play a fundamental role in breast cancer responsiveness to chemotherapy. We investigated two peripheral indicators of immunity/inflammation, i.e. neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), in order to reveal a possible relationship with pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with early or locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). We retrospectively analyzed 373 consecutive patients affected by breast cancer and candidates to NACT. The complete blood cell count before starting NACT was evaluated to calculate NLR and PLR. ROC curve analysis determined threshold values of 2.42 and 104.47 as best cut-off values for NLR and PLR, respectively. The relationships between NLR/PLR and pCR, along with other clinical-pathological characteristics, were evaluated by Pearson's χ 2 or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a logistic regression model. NLR and PLR were not significantly associated with pCR if analyzed separately. However, when combining NLR and PLR, patients with a NLR low /PLR low profile achieved a significantly higher rate of pCR compared to those with NLR high and/or PLR high (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.22–4.27, p 0.009). Importantly, the predictive value of NLR low /PLR low was independent from common prognostic factors such as grading, Ki67, and molecular subtypes. The combination of NLR and PLR may reflect patients' immunogenic phenotype. Low levels of both NLR and PLR may thus indicate a status of immune system activation that may predict pCR in breast cancer patients treated with NACT. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the distribution of MRI breast parenchymal enhancement (BPE) among different breast cancer subtypes searching for any significant difference in terms of immunohistochemical and receptorial patterns (Estrogen Receptor -ER, Progesterone Receptor - PR, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 - HER2). Methods: 82 consecutive patients affected by breast cancer underwent breast DCE-MRI. Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated all subtracted MR enhanced images for classifying BPE. ER, PR and HER2 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. ER and PR status was evaluated using Allred score (positive values: score ≥3). The intensity of the cerbB-2 staining was scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ (positive values: ≥ 3+; negative:0 and 1+; 2+ value assessed with silver in-situ hybridization). Patients were classified into five categories based on cancer subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B HER2 negative, Luminal B HER2 positive, HER2 positive non luminal, triple negative. The χ2 test was used for evaluating the significance of BPE type distribution into the five groups of tumor subtypes and the distribution of the five breast cancer subtypes among every single BPE type. The correlation of BPE with factors such as age, menopausal status and lesion diameter was investigated using multivariate regression analysis and logistic regression. Cohen's kappa statistics was used in order to assess inter-observer agreement for classifying BPE. Results: 6/82 cases were Luminal A-like (7.3%), 42/82 Luminal B-like (HER2-) (51.2%), 12/82 Luminal B-like (HER2+) (14.6%), 4/82 Non Luminal (HER+) (4.9%), 18/82 Triple Negative (ductal) (22%). 16/82 cases showed minimal BPE, 28/82 mild BPE, 22/82 moderate BPE, 16/82 marked BPE. Mild BPE pattern was significantly more prevalent (p = 0.0001) than other BPE types only in the luminal B (HER-) tumors. Moderate and marked BPE prevailed over minimal and mild, in triple negatives. Among all patients with mild BPE, luminal B (HER2-) tumors were significantly higher (p = 0.0001). Among all patients with marked BPE, triple negative subtypes were significantly higher (p = 0.0074). No significant confounder to BPE qualitative evaluation was found (p = 0.39). The inter-rater agreement in evaluating BPE patterns on MRI was almost perfect with Cohen's k = 0.83. Conclusions: BPE could play a crucial role as an imaging bridge to molecular breast cancer subtype allowing an additional risk stratification in the field of breast MRI and targeted screening tests. Luminal B (HER2-) tumors could prevail in case of mild BPE on CE-MRI examinations and TN tumors in patients with marked BPE. Further studies on larger series are needed to confirm this hypothesis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) has an exceptionally low survival rate and primary prevention strategies are limited. Folate plays an important role in one-carbon metabolism and has been associated with the risk of several cancers, but not consistently with PC risk. We aimed to investigate the association between dietary folate intake and PC risk, using the standardised folate database across 10 European countries. A total of 477,206 participants were followed up for 11 years, during which 865 incident primary PC cases were recorded. Folate intake was energy-adjusted using the residual method. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. In multivariable analyses stratified by age, sex, study centre and adjusted for energy intake, smoking status, BMI, educational level, diabetes status, supplement use and dietary fibre intake, we found no significant association between folate intake and PC risk: the HR of PC risk for those in the highest quartile of folate intake (≥353 μg/day) compared to the lowest (&lt;241 μg/day) was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.31; ptrend = 0.38). In current smokers, a positive trend was observed in PC risk across folate quartiles [HR = 4.42 (95% CI: 1.05, 18.62) for ≥353 μg/day vs. &lt;241 μg/day, ptrend = 0.01]. Nonetheless, there was no significant interaction between smoking and dietary folate intake (pinteraction = 0.99). We found no association between dietary folate intake and PC risk in this large European study. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "The platinum-based, two-drug, 3-week regimen is currently the main first-line chemotherapy program for the treatment of advanced squamous cell lung cancer. The aim of this phase II clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of the bi-weekly program of liposomal paclitaxel combined with nedaplatin as a first-line treatment for advanced squamous cell lung cancer. A total of 52 cases of advanced squamous cell lung cancer were included in this phase II clinical trial. Patients received intravenous infusion of liposomal paclitaxel (100 mg/m 2 ) and nedaplatin (50 mg/m 2 ) on days 1 and 15 of a 4-week cycle. Each patient received two to six cycles of chemotherapy, consistent with the regimen of combined liposomal paclitaxel and nedaplatin. The total effective rate of this chemotherapy program was 37.5%. The median progression-free survival time was 8.5 months (95% confidence interval: 7.8–9.2). The median survival time was 16 months (95% confidence interval: 14.1–17.9). The main adverse event was myelosuppression. Grade 3 leukopenia was noted in seven patients (13.5%), and no grade 4 leukopenia was observed. Grade 3 anemia was noted in four patients (7.7%), and no grade 4 anemia was observed. In addition, no grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia and no grade 3 or 4 non-bone marrow toxicity was detected. The bi-weekly program of liposomal paclitaxel combined with nedaplatin is effective for the treatment of advanced squamous cell lung cancer, with high safety and few adverse events. However, additional studies are warranted to confirm these results. The trial was registered under the number ChiCTR-OIN-17011423. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "This study describes a series of newly synthesized phosphine/diimine ruthenium complexes containing the lawsone as bioligand with enhanced cytotoxicity against different cancer cells, and apoptosis induction in prostatic cancer cells DU-145. The complexes [Ru(law)(N-N) 2 ]PF 6 where N-N is 2,2′-bipyridine (1) or 1,10-phenanthroline (2) and [Ru(law)(dppm)(N-N)]PF 6 , where dppm means bis(diphenylphosphino)methane, N-N is 2,2′-bipyridine (3) or 1,10-phenanthroline (4), and law is lawsone, were synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, NMR, UV–vis, IR spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry. The interaction of the complexes (1–4) with DNA was evaluated by circular dichroism, gel electrophoresis, and fluorescence, and the complexes presented interactions by the minor grooves DNA. The phosphinic series of complexes exhibited a remarkably broad spectrum of anticancer activity with approximately 34-fold higher than cisplatin and 5-fold higher than doxorubicin, inhibiting the growth of 3D tumor spheroids and the ability to retain the colony survival of DU-145 cells. Also, the complex (4) inhibits DU-145 cell adhesion and migration potential indicating antimetastatic properties. The mechanism of its anticancer activity was found to be related to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, increased the BAX/BCL-2 ratio and subsequent apoptosis induction. Overall, these findings suggested that the complex (4) could be a promising candidate for further evaluation as a chemotherapeutic agent in the prostate cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "No licensed therapeutic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is currently available, so it remains a high priority to develop a therapeutic HPV vaccine or prophylactic/therapeutic HPV vaccine for cervical cancer. In this current study, we designed an HPV vaccine including CpG oligodeoxynucleotides 1826 as an adjuvant and HPV16 E7 43-77 peptide as antigen, which contains a CD8 T cell epitope (E7 49-57), and two CD4 T cell epitopes (E7 43-77 and E7 50-62). The prophylactic and therapeutic effect on cervical cancer induced by a single administration of vaccine, were comprehensively evaluated by examining the tumor size and the percentage of tumor-free/bearing mice. The cellular immunity and modulation of immunosuppressive cells induced by the vaccine were evaluated by examining intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) of splenocytes and FCM, respectively. Antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were investigated using in vivo cytolytic assay. The results showed that the single administration of vaccine elicited significant prophylactic as well as therapeutic effect on cervical cancer. The increased cellular immunity mediated by CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells and CD8 + IFN-γ + T cells, and the decreased numbers of immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were induced by the vaccine. Antigen-specific CTL response was also induced by vaccination. These findings suggested that significant anti-tumor effect of the vaccine may result from the induction of increased cellular immunity and decreased immunosuppressive cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The nature of cancer increases the spiritual needs of patients and necessitates the provision of holistic care for them. By trying to meet the spiritual needs of patients, oncology nurses can help them adapt, gain inner peace, and develop positive thoughts and attitudes. This study aimed to explore the consequences of spiritual care for cancer patients and oncology nurses from the perspective of the patients, family members, nurses, and other health-care team members. Methods: The present qualitative study was conducted using conventional content analysis in 2016-2017. The data were collected through semi-structured deep interviews of the 18 participants. Results: The theme extracted from the data was 'spiritual growth' and comprised the major categories of 'nurse's spiritual development' and 'patient's spiritual development.' There were three subcategories in the nurse's spiritual development and 11 subcategories in the patient's spiritual development. Conclusions: Spiritual care places the cancer patient and the oncology nurse on the path to spiritual growth. The achievement of peace by the patient and the nurse was a common consequence of spiritual care. It helps the nurse promote comfort and a sense of peace in the patient and eventually to obtain inner satisfaction. Considering the transcendental effects of spiritual care, a systematic plan should be devised to enhance sensitivity in oncology nurses and encourage them to make spiritual care a component of interventional plans. © 2018 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The use of patient-reported outcome measures is increasingly advocated to support high-quality cancer care. We therefore investigated the added value of the Distress Thermometer (DT) when combined with known predictors to assess one-year survival in patients with lung cancer. Methods: All patients had newly diagnosed or recurrent lung cancer, started systemic treatment, and participated in the intervention arm of a previously published randomised controlled trial. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted based on five selected known predictors for survival. The DT-score was added to this model and contrasted to models including the EORTC-QLQ-C30 global QoL score (quality of life) or the HADS total score (symptoms of anxiety and depression). Model performance was evaluated through improvement in the -2 log likelihood, Harrell's C-statistic, and a risk classification. Results: In total, 110 patients were included in the analysis of whom 97 patients accurately completed the DT. Patients with a DT score ≥5 (N = 51) had a lower QoL, more symptoms of anxiety and depression, and a shorter median survival time (7.6 months vs 10.0 months; P = 0.02) than patients with a DT score <5 (N = 46). Addition of the DT resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of the model to predict one-year survival (P < 0.001) and the discriminatory value (C-statistic) marginally improved from 0.69 to 0.71. The proportion of patients correctly classified as high risk (≥85% risk of dying within one year) increased from 8% to 28%. Similar model performance was observed when combining the selected predictors with QoL and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Conclusions: Use of the DT allows clinicians to better identify patients with lung cancer at risk for poor outcomes, to further explore sources of distress, and subsequently personalize care accordingly. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and is associated with high mortality rates. We previously reported that Xanthium strumarium L. induces mitotic arrest in proliferating cells, a process mediated by xanthatins. Hypothesis/Aim: The aim of this work is to study if xanthatins, isolated from X. strumarium total extract, affect the proliferative capacity of CT26WT colon cancer cells and, in consequence, if tumor growth and proliferation of (lung) metastatic sites can also be arrested in vivo. Study design: This study consisted of both in vitro and in vivo experiments involving the CT26WT cell line and a subcutaneous mouse model of colon cancer. In vitro cell cycle progression, in vivo tumoral growth and anti-metastatic activity were analyzed to investigate whether xanthatins of X. strumarium induce mitotic arrest in proliferating colorectal carcinoma. Results: Our in vitro results show that X. strumarium, mediated by xanthatins, induces G 2 /M arrest and impair anaphase entrance. This leads to a significant induction of apoptotic and necrotic in CT26WT cells, demonstrating their significant anti-proliferative activity through interfering with the mitotic apparatus. Furthermore, our in vivoresults reveal that X. strumarium inhibits both tumor growth and metastasis progression. Conclusion: X. strumarium antitumor activities are mainly mediated by xanthatins through inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis, inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells. These findings further confirm the therapeutic potential of X. strumarium in colorectal cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Ocular surface squamous neoplasia includes a spectrum of diseases from dysplasia to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the conjunctiva. Whether the degree of invasion influences outcomes is debated. We evaluated the outcomes and management of conjunctival carcinomas defined as ≤0.2 mm invasion of the chorion (microinvasive; miSCC) or over (SCC). Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Clinical, tumor, and therapeutic characteristics and outcomes were collected for consecutive patients with histology-proven invasive conjunctival miSCC/SCC treated between 2002 and 2017. Results: Patients were 70% men, ≥70 years old (56%), with carcinomas of the bulbar conjunctiva (83.0%). Limbal, corneal, and/or scleral involvement were present in 70.4%, 42.6%, and 27.8%, respectively. Patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and no-touch surgery rates were similar between the 39 SCC and 15 miSCC. However, mitomycin was performed in 93.3% and 20.5% of miSCC and SCC, respectively (P <.001). Proton therapy was performed in 0% and 92.0% of miSCC and SCC, respectively (P <.001). SCC received mitomycin in case of tumoral resection margins, respectively (P =.018). The 24-month incidence of local relapse was 14.8%, including 20% and 12% for miSCC and SCC, respectively (P =.079). Irradiation was the only prognostic factor associated with a lower risk for local relapse (hazard ratio [0.25]; P =.045). There were 2 cancer-related deaths (2%). Mild/moderate anterior segment complications occurred in one third of the patients. Conclusions: miSCC had slightly worse relapse rates compared with SCC. Postoperative proton therapy, performed in SCC only, was associated with a lower risk for relapse. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) infiltration contributes to cancer malignant progression. However, the mechanisms for controlling recruitment and M2 polarization of macrophages by cancer cells are largely unclear. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is abundantly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mediates cancer progression. NOXs are in close relation with cancer-related inflammation, nevertheless, whether tumoral NOXs influence microenvironmental macrophages remains undentified. This study found that there was a close association between NOX4 expression and macrophage chemotaxis in patients with NSCLC analyzed using TCGA RNA-sequencing data. NOX4 in NSCLC cells (A549 and Calu-1 cell lines) efficiently enhanced murine peritoneal macrophage migration and induces M2 polarization. Immunohistochemical analysis of clinical specimens confirmed the positive correlation of NOX4 and CD68 or CD206. The mechanical study revealed that tumoral NOX4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulated various cytokine production, including CCL7, IL8, CSF-1 and VEGF-C, via PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent manner. Blockade of the function of these cytokines reversed NOX4 effect on macrophages. Specifically, the results showed that tumoral NOX4-educated M2 macrophages exhibited elevated JNK activity, expressed and released HB-EGF, thus facilitating NSCLC proliferation in vitro. Pretreatment of macrophages with JNK inhibitor blocked tumoral NOX4-induced HB-EGF production in M2 macrophages. Finally, in a xenograft mouse model, overexpression of NOX4 in A549 cells enhanced the tumor growth. Elimination of ROS by NAC or inhibition of NOX4 activity by GKT137831 suppressed tumor growth accompanied by reduction in macrophage infiltration and the percentage of M2 macrophages. In conclusion, our study indicates that tumoral NOX4 recruits M2 TAMs via ROS/PI3K signaling-dependent various cytokine production, thus contributing NSCLC cell growth. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The role of chemotherapy has not been established in the treatment of metastatic squamous cell oesophageal cancer (mESCC). Patients and methods: E-DIS is a discontinuation trial, aimed at estimating efficacy, quality of life and safety of chemotherapy continuation (CT-CONT) in patients with mESCC who are free from progression after a selection phase of chemotherapy. The primary end-point was overall survival. Results: Sixty-seven patients were randomised. The 9-month survival rate was 50% (85% confidence interval [CI]: 37–62%) and 48% (85% CI: 35–60%) in the CT-CONT arm and in the chemotherapy discontinuation (CT-DISC) arm, respectively. The time until definitive deterioration of the global health status (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] core quality of life questionnaire) was 6.6 months (95% CI: 3.3–12.4) for the CT-CONT arm and 4.2 months (95% CI: 2.9–6.3) for the CT-DISC arm, with a hazard ratio (HR CT-DISC/CT-CONT ) = 1.44 (95% CI: 0.82–2.53). We observed a beneficial trend in favour of CT-CONT (HR &gt; 1) for most dimensions, including an improvement for three dimensions (dysphagia, eating and oesophageal pain) of the EORTC Oesophageal Cancer Module QLQ-OES18. Conclusion: CT-CONT provides an overall survival rate that is similar to CT-DISC. E-DIS trial provides valuable data to support shared decision-making between physicians and patients regarding CT-CONT/DISC. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To describe stage I-III breast cancer (BC) molecular subtypes and outcomes among a cohort of patients from Brazil. Methods: AMAZONA study is a retrospective cohort conducted from June 2008 to January 2009 including women of at least 18 years old, with histologically proven breast cancer, diagnosed in 2001 (n = 2198) and 2006 (n = 2714). In this analysis, we included patients who underwent surgery, had stage I-III disease and available pathological information (n = 2296). We estimated molecular subtypes by local immunohistochemical stains. Data was obtained from medical charts and public databases. Results: Mean age at diagnosis was 54 years and 41.1% were younger than 50 years. 23.3% were diagnosed in stage I, 53.5% in stage II and 23.2% in stage III. 80.8% were treated in the public health system. 71.3% had hormonal receptor positive disease, 15.7% were HER-2 positive and 21.1% had triple-negative breast cancer. 55.6% were treated with mastectomy and 96.2% received adjuvant treatment (82.2% chemotherapy). 13.4% of HER-2 positive patients received adjuvant trastuzumab. Overall survival rate at 5 years was 96.84% for stage I, 94.16% for stage II and 70.48% for stage III. Molecular subtypes were independent prognostic factor in stages II and III patients. Conclusions: Brazilian women have a higher risk of being diagnosed with late stage breast cancer and younger age than in high-income countries. Luminal-like disease is the most common molecular subtype in the country. Triple negative and HER-2 positive had the worst prognosis. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The goal of the current study was to develop and examine the feasibility and acceptability of a self-help smoking cessation intervention targeted to the teachable moment of smokers undergoing low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening. Materials and methods: We used a multi-phase qualitative approach, including focus groups (N = 15) and learner verification interviews (N = 16) to develop a targeted intervention for patients receiving a LDCT screening, by extending and modifying a previously validated, self-help intervention. The new intervention was then tested in a feasibility study for acceptability and receptivity by smokers (N = 18) receiving a LDCT screening. Results: The main themes that emerged from the focus group findings included a need to address the counterproductive thoughts regarding a negative lung screen result, the desire to enjoy a healthy and smoke-free retirement, the need to increase self-efficacy regarding smoking cessation, and the desire to see statistics regarding survival after quitting smoking. Learner verification findings showed that participants responded favorably to most booklet and pamphlet changes. Minor changes were made to improve comprehension and enhance self-efficacy. Formative findings led to the development of a new initial booklet titled, “Lung Cancer Screening & Quitting Smoking: Taking Control of Your Health,” as well as modifications of the existing self-help cessation intervention. The intervention was designed to be initiated at the LDCT appointment, prior to receipt of scan results, and with minimal disruption of clinic work-flow. Results from the feasibility study indicated that acceptability and satisfaction with the new intervention were high. Conclusion: A validated self-help smoking-cessation intervention was modified for smokers receiving LDCT screening for lung cancer based on formative research guided by the teachable moment concept. The new intervention is ready for testing in a randomized controlled trial. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although there are multiple treatments for lung cancer, the death rate of this cancer remains high because of metastasis in earlier stages. So a novel treatment for overcoming metastasis is urgently needed. Overexpression of high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), a nonhistone chromosomal protein has been observed in metastatic cancers. So, we suggested that HMGA2 upregulation may play a critical role in treating lung cancer. Methods: The A549 cells were transfected with specific HMGA2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) using transfection reagent. Relative HMGA2 and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1), C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), vimentin, and E-cadherin messenger RNA expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. To diagnose cytotoxic effect of HMGA2 siRNA and other components of transfection process, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was applied. The migration capacity after transfection with HMGA2 siRNA was detected by wound-healing assay. Results: HMGA2 siRNA significantly reduced HMGA2 expression in a dose-dependent manner 48 hours after transfection. Expression levels of MMP1, vimentin, and CXCR4 were reduced, but E-cadherin level was not changed meaningfully. HMGA2 knockdown significantly reduced cell survival rate and also led to the inhibition of cell migration. Conclusions: Our results indicated that RNA interference by downregulation of HMGA2 gene expression and affecting downstream genes led to the inhibition of cell migration and proliferation. Therefore, HMGA2 siRNA might be an alternative treatment option for metastatic lung cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The dignity of patients is a major concern among health professionals engaged in the care of individuals with advanced cancer. Although several dignity promoting interventions have been developed, none of them have focused on a positive, resource-based approach. The aim of our study, entitled Revie ⊕, was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-guided life-review intervention, focusing on strength and resources, for patients with advanced cancer and for nurses delivering the intervention. Method: Our 2015–2016 study was conducted with patients with advanced cancer in an ambulatory and an inpatient setting of a Swiss university hospital. An embedded concurrent mixed method design was used. The feasibility and acceptability of Revie ⊕ was explored, as were changes in the sense of dignity, posttraumatic growth, and satisfaction with life. Results: A total of 41 patients received the intervention. The level of attrition was low (26%). Administering the Revie ⊕ intervention proved to be feasible. Participants (patients and nurses) considered the intervention helpful with a high level of satisfaction. A merged data analysis highlighted the need to address the patients’ existential concerns. The majority of the participants found that the intervention helped them, and they recommend it for other patients. Conclusions: This study indicates that the Revie ⊕ intervention, which focuses on a resource-based approach, was perceived favorably by all of the participants. A change in the nurse-patient relationship was noted and it was deemed to be beneficial. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "PANDAR (promoter of CDKN1A antisense DNA damage activated RNA) has been shown to be aberrantly expressed in many types of cancer. Considering conflicting data, the current study was aimed to assess its potential role as a prognostic marker in malignant tumors. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science was performed to identify all eligible studies describing the use of PANDAR as a prognostic factor for different types of cancer. Data related to overall survival (OS) and clinicopathologic features were collected and analyzed. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds radio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate associations. Ten original studies containing 1,231 patients were included. The results showed that in patients with cancer, high PANDAR expression is correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM; OR = 2.57; 95% CI, 1.76–3.81; p < 0.001), tumor stage (OR = 2.90; 95% CI, 1.25–6.75; p = 0.013), and tumor size (OR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.11–2.91; p = 0.018). However, sensitivity analysis further demonstrated a significant association between high PANDAR expression and OS, both in multivariate and univariate analysis models (pooled HR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.17–3.44 and pooled HR 2.62; 95% CI, 1.98–3.47, respectively), after omitting one study. These results suggested that PANDAR expression might be indicative of advanced disease and poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Further studies are necessary to determine the value of this risk stratification biomarker in clinical management of patients with cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a register-based algorithm to identify patients with recurrence of breast cancer (BC). Methods: We conducted a cohort study based on data from Danish national health registers and used the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish National Pathology Register as sources to identify BC recurrence. We used data from the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) validated against medical records on recurrence status and recurrence date for 471 women with early stage unilateral BC as the gold standard of BC recurrence to assess the accuracy of the algorithm to identify BC recurrence. Results: The algorithm displayed a sensitivity of 97.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 93.2–99.3), a specificity of 97.2% (95% CI: 94.8–98.7) and a positive predictive value of 94.4% (95% CI: 89.2–97.3). The concordance correlation coefficient for the agreement between recurrence dates generated by the algorithm and the gold standard was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98), and the date was estimated within +/−30 days of the gold standard in 66% of the patients and within +/−60 days in 76% of the patients. Conclusion: The developed algorithm almost perfectly identified BC recurrence and with reasonable timing compared to the gold standard. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Due to conflicting results between major trials the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in stage IV small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is controversial. Methods: We obtained a list of 13 European experts from both the European Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ESTRO) and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). The strategies in decision making for PCI in stage IV SCLC were collected. Decision trees were created representing these strategies. Analysis of consensus was performed with the objective consensus methodology. Results: The factors associated with the recommendation for the use of PCI included the fitness of the patient, young age and good response to chemotherapy. PCI was recommended by the majority of experts for non-elderly fit patients who had at least a partial response (PR) to chemotherapy (for complete remission (CR) 85% of radiation oncologists and 69% of medical oncologists, for PR: 85% of radiation oncologists and 54% of medical oncologists). For patients with stable disease after chemotherapy, PCI was recommended by 6 out of 13 (46%) radiation oncologists and only 3 out of 13 medical oncologists (23%). For elderly fit patients with CR, a majority recommended PCI (62%) and no consensus was reached for patients with PR. Conclusion: European radiation and medical oncologists specializing in lung cancer recommend PCI in selected patients and restrict its use primarily to fit, non-elderly patients who responded to chemotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To evaluate in how many cancer-related Cochrane reviews hazard ratio (HR)-based absolute effects in summary of findings (SoF) tables have been correctly calculated and reported. Study Design and Setting: We identified all Cochrane cancer intervention reviews that reported an HR for at least one outcome and provided a SoF table, published between January 2011 and December 2017 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Results: In 28 reviews (29%) of 96 included Cochrane reviews, absolute effects in the SoF tables were calculated in a correct manner. In 23 reviews (24%), absolute effects had been correctly calculated, but there was no explanation given why authors calculated event-free survival (e.g., overall survival) throughout the review but reported number of events in SoF tables (e.g., death). Twelve reviews (13%) provided incorrect absolute effects. For seven reviews (7%), it was unclear if absolute effects were correctly calculated. In 26 (27%) reviews, no absolute effects based on the given HR were calculated. Conclusions: In less than one-third of cancer-related Cochrane reviews, absolute effect size estimates were correctly calculated and reported. There is a need for guidance on how to calculate and report absolute effect estimates based on HR data. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: From prospective studies, pathologic nodal clearance (PNC, ypN0) and pathologic complete response (pCR, ypT0N0) correlate with overall survival (OS) following neoadjuvant chemoradiation for cN2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Contemporary cooperative group trials attempt to increase radiation doses to achieve nodal clearance and/or pCR. However, long-term comparative outcomes of dose-escalated neoadjuvant chemoradiation are lacking. The goal of this study was to evaluate rates of PNC and pCR in a large population of cN2 NSCLC, predictors thereof, and long-term outcomes thereafter. Methods: The National Cancer Database was queried (2004–2015) for histologically-confirmed cT1-4N2M0 NSCLC undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by lobectomy. Statistics included multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier OS analysis before and following propensity matching, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and sensitivity analysis when varying neoadjuvant radiation dose. Results: Of 1750 patients, the pCR and PNC rates were 17% and 37%, respectively. Radiation dose >54 Gy independently predicted for pCR. Patients achieving pCR experienced significantly higher OS than non-pCR cases (p < 0.001) and ypT + ypN0 cases (p < 0.001). In the subset of non-PNC patients, there was a trend towards higher OS in patients in whom ypT0 was achieved (p = 0.059). On sensitivity analysis, when separating the cohort into doses of 45.0–50.4 Gy, 50.5–54.0 Gy, 54.1–59.4 Gy, and >59.4 Gy, 30-day mortality rates in the respective groups were 2.9%, 1.8%, 1.2%, and 3.4%. Conclusions: Although neoadjuvant dose-escalation increases pCR rates, there is no OS benefit with dose-escalation, and high dose-escalation (i.e., >59.4 Gy) was associated with numerically higher mortality rates, indicating the importance of careful multidisciplinary discussion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: We aimed to assess the implementation and effectiveness of exemestane plus everolimus treatment per hospital type in real-life, shortly after approval of everolimus. Methods: Advanced breast cancer patients treated with exemestane plus everolimus in 2012–2014 were included from the SONABRE registry. Progression-free survival (PFS) and a 12-week conditional PFS (post-hoc) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was performed by type of hospital and adjusted for patient, tumour and treatment characteristics. Results: We included 122 patients, comprising 48 patients treated in academic (N = 1), 56 in teaching (N = 4), and 18 in non-teaching (N = 2) hospitals. The median PFS was 6.3 months (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 4.0–8.6) overall, and 8.5 months (95% CI 7.7–9.3), 4.2 months (95% CI 2.0–6.3), and 5.5 months (95% CI 4.2–6.7) for the patients treated in academic, teaching and non-teaching hospitals, respectively. The adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) for PFS-events was 1.5 (95% CI 1.0–2.2) and 1.0 (95% CI 0.5–1.9) respectively for patients treated at teaching and non-teaching hospitals versus the academic hospital. The adjusted HR for 12-week conditional PFS-events was not different between hospital types. In the first 12-week treatment period, treatment was discontinued due to early progression in one out of 48 patients in the academic versus nine out of 74 patients in the non-academic hospitals, confirmed by imaging in one and two patients, respectively. Conclusions: In our study, the median PFS was borderline significantly different between hospital types, possibly the result of a different assessment approach in the first 12-week treatment period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Perioperative systemic treatment is standard of care for Caucasian patients with locally advanced, resectable gastric adenocarcinoma. The prognostic relevance of the microsatellite instability (MSI) status in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection is unclear. We analyzed the association of the MSI status with histological regression and clinical outcome in patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic treatment. Tumor tissue from patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection for gastric or gastroesophageal-junction adenocarcinoma was analyzed for MSI status using a mononucleotide marker panel encompassing the markers BAT25, BAT26, and CAT25. Histological regression, relapse-free survival and overall survival were calculated and correlated with MSI status. We identified the MSI-H phenotype in 9 (8.9%) out of 101 analyzed tumors. Though a poor histological response was observed in eight out of nine MSI-H patients, overall survival was significantly better for patients with MSI-H compared to MSS tumors (median overall survival not reached vs. 38.6 months, log-rank test p = 0.014). Among MSI-H patients, an unexpected long-term survival after relapse was observed. Our data indicate that the MSI-H phenotype is a favorable prognostic marker in gastric cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. The benefit of perioperative cytotoxic treatment in patients with MSI-H gastric cancer, however, remains questionable. Future trials should stratify patients according to their MSI status, and novel treatment modalities focusing on MSI-H tumors should be considered. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important functions in tumor development and progression, including colorectal cancer (CRC), but their roles are not completely understood. In this study, the roles of the lncRNA transmembrane phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase and tensin homolog 2 pseudogene 1 (TPTE2P1), previously implicated in gallbladder cancer cell migration and invasion, were evaluated in CRC. In particular, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify TPTE2P1 levels in tumor tissues and cell lines. The association between TPTE2P1 and survival was analyzed using the online tool OncoLnc. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, colony formation assays, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the effects of TPTE2P1 on viability, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Signaling pathway proteins were quantitated by Western blot analysis. Finally, the role of TPTE2P1 was analyzed in vivo using mouse models. TPTE2P1 levels were significantly higher in CRC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. Higher expression was associated with a poor survival rate. The silencing of TPTE2P1 led to cell cycle arrest at the S phase and thereby inhibited cell viability. TPTE2P1 knockdown also caused cancer cell apoptosis via the activation of the apoptosis regulator (BCL2)/caspase 3 signaling cascade. In addition, the inhibition of TPTE2P1 had suppressive effects on tumors in vivo. TPTE2P1 is upregulated in CRC and plays essential roles in the regulation of cell viability in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Some studies suggest that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are associated with higher risk of adverse events than antiandrogens (AAs) monotherapy. However, it has been unclear whether this is due to indication bias. Objective: To investigate rates of change in comorbidity for men on GnRH agonists versus AA monotherapy in a population-based register study. Design, setting, and participants: Men with advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PCa) who received primary AA (n = 2078) or GnRH agonists (n = 4878) and age- and area-matched PCa-free men were selected from Prostate Cancer Database Sweden 3.0. Increases in comorbidity were measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), from 5 yr before through to 5 yr after starting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Outcome measures and statistical methods: Multivariable linear regression was used to determine differences in excess rate of CCI change before and after ADT initiation. Risk of any incremental change in CCI following ADT was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results and limitations: Men on GnRH agonists experienced a greater difference in excess rate of CCI change after starting ADT than men on AA monotherapy (5.6% per yr, p < 0.001). Risk of any new CCI change after ADT was greater for GnRH agonists than for AA (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–1.44). Conclusions: Impact on comorbidity was lower for men on AA monotherapy than for men on GnRH agonists. Our results should be confirmed through randomised trials of effectiveness and adverse effects, comparing AA monotherapy and GnRH agonists in men with advanced nonmetastatic PCa who are unsuitable for curative treatment. Patient summary: Hormone therapies for advanced prostate cancer can increase the risk of other diseases (eg, heart disease, diabetes). This study compared two common forms of hormone therapy and found that the risk of another serious disease was higher for those on gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists than for those on antiandrogen monotherapy. The increase in overall comorbidity following androgen androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer was significantly higher for gonadotrophin gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists than for anti-androgen (AA) monotherapy. More consideration should be given to AA monotherapy as an alternative first-line therapy. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is known to be one of the most lethal malignancies associated with women disease. The CA-125 protein is a repetitive epitope of MUC-16, which plays key role in enhancing the proliferation of cancer cells and inhibiting anticancer immune responses. It is the most widely used biomarker for early stage diagnosis of OC. Also it is the only serum marker which currently used in clinical diagnosis. Monitoring of CA-125 protein in the serum sample is also valuable in evaluating the response of ovarian cancer to treatment. In this research, a novel immunoassay based on immobilization of CA-125 antibody on the biointerface of silver nanoparticles modified graphene quantum dots ink (Ag NPs-GQDs) was successfully designed to recognition of CA-125 protein in a human plasma sample. The supplied immunoassay presents the proper ability to detect and determine the amount of CA-125 biomarker in low concentrations of CA-125 biomarker. The proposed immunosensor was employed for the detection of CA-125 using differential pulse voltammetry (DPVs) and square wave voltammetry (SWVs) techniques. The proposed interface leads to enhancement of accessible surface area for immobilizing a high amount of anti-CA-125 antibody, increasing electrical conductivity, boosting stability, catalytic properties and biocompatibility. Under the optimized operating conditions, the low limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the proposed immunosensor was recorded as 0.01 U/mL, which this evaluation was performed at highly linear range of 0.01–400 U/mL. The proposed immunoassay was successfully applied for the monitoring of CA-125 in unprocessed human plasma samples. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the key event in distant metastasis of diverse tumors including lung cancer. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in EMT phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanism of EMT induced by PTEN inactivation is not clear in lung cancer. We aimed to investigate the role of PTEN inactivation in acquisition of EMT in lung cancer cells. Methods: We knocked out the PTEN in PTEN proficient lung cancer cells lines (A549 and NCI-H460) using CRISPR/Cas-9 system and observed the growth, EMT phenotypes, and EMT related molecules. We also explored the in vivo effect of PTEN inactivation on tumor cell growth and distant metastasis using nude mouse injection. Results: PTEN knockout (KO) cells showed faster growth, migration and invasion than PTEN wild-type (WT) cells. When we injected the cells into nude mice, PTEN-KO cells showed faster growth and higher metastatic potential. In PTEN-KO cells, the levels of phosphorylated AKT (Ser-473 and Thr-308) were profoundly elevated and the expressions of phosphorylated GSK-3β (Ser9, inactive form) increased, while that of β-catenin decreased. Regarding the EMT markers, the expression of E-cadherin decreased but those of N-cadherin, vimentin and MMP-2 increased in the PTEN-KO cells. Especially, PTEN-KO cells showed the almost complete intra-nuclear shift of β-catenin and no β-catenin signal was observed in the cell membrane. Accordingly, PTEN-KO cells exhibited morphological changes such as loss of cell-to-cell contact, pseudopodia and the round shape, which are the typical phenotypes of EMT. Snail and Slug were also dominantly accumulated in the nucleus after PTEN inactivation. Conclusion: All these data consistently support that PTEN inactivation contributes to EMT by nuclear translocation of β-catenin and Snail/Slug in lung cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Several components isolated from rhubarb, the root of Rheum undulatum L., including emodin, rhein, rhaponticin, and piceatannol, have been reported to induce cell death and inhibit metastasis in various types of cancer. Recently, piceatannol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (PG) isolated from rhubarb was demonstrated to improve vascular dysfunction by inhibiting arginase activity. Purpose: In this study, we examined the anti-cancer activities of PG, including effects on the proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis of endothelial and malignant cancer cells. Results: We found that PG did not affect the proliferation of human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at treatments up to 100 μM. However, PG efficiently suppressed the metastatic ability of HT1080 cells, as determined by scratch wound migration, transwell migration/invasion assay, and three-dimensional (3D) spheroid invasion assay. PG significantly suppressed the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced increase of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression as well as gelatinolytic MMP-9 activity, which are essential for cancer metastasis. In addition, PG treatment reduced the production of proangiogenic factors in HT1080 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and suppressed hypoxia-induced activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α pathway. We also found that HUVEC angiogenic activity, including migration and tubular structure formation, were significantly reduced by PG treatment. Moreover, in an in ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, spontaneous and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced vessel formation were significantly inhibited by PG treatment. Conclusion: These results collectively indicate that PG has potent anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic activities with no cytotoxicity. Thus, PG may be useful to limit the hyperplasia of malignant tumors and the spread of cancer to distant secondary organs. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an effective means of treating tumors because tumor cells are sensitive to heat. Gold and carbon nanoparticles are used as efficient PTT materials. However, development of a non-toxic biodegradable PTT agent remains a challenge. Here, we developed a hemoglobin (Hb) hydrogel that exhibited excellent PTT effects in vitro and in vivo. Unlike conventional PTT agents, which are toxic and do not decompose completely in the body, the Hb hydrogel was manufactured using only two components: (i) Hb, a natural substance derived from the human body, and (ii) PEG, an FDA-approved polymer. The gelation time of the Hb hydrogels could be controlled by changing the Hb concentration. Because Hb is present at a high concentration (150 mg/ml) in the body, the Hb hydrogel decomposed and was eliminated in vivo without toxicity. The Hb hydrogel showed an excellent PTT effect in response to 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation and had excellent anticancer effects against A549 lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Blood hematology and blood biochemical assay results from an animal model treated with Hb hydrogel were similar to those of the control group. Importantly, toxicity was not observed based on H&amp;E staining of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, kidneys and lung). Tumors of A549 cell-xenografted mice treated with Hb hydrogel and 808 nm NIR laser irradiation were significantly smaller than those of the control group (23.1 mm 3 versus 746.5 mm 3 , respectively). This is a first report of a biocompatible photothermal hydrogel based on hemoglobin, and our overall results suggest that Hb hydrogels are commercially-promising PTT systems that have excellent anti-cancer effects. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Quality in lung cancer care is in Denmark routinely evaluated using quality indicators. The indicators are reported from national registries and are based on data from health care professionals. However, data based on the patients’ perspective are rarely reported. The aim of this study was to propose a model for the use of patient reported outcomes (PROs) as quality indicators, enabling us to compare PROs across the surgical departments in Denmark. Methods: All patients registered in the Danish Lung Cancer Registry (DLCR) from 1 October 2013 until 30 September 2015 who received surgical treatment were eligible (N = 1718). They were asked to complete the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire six months after surgery. From QLQ-C30 we chose global health status (GHS) and role function (RF) as indicators to be tested. An indicator threshold for good performance was set to ≥ 65 points (on a scale 0–100 where 100 was the best). Results were compared between the four thoracic surgical departments in Denmark. Results: Of 1615 patients alive six months after surgery, questionnaires were completed by 1002 patients (62.0%). The patients from the four departments differed significantly in clinical variables at diagnosis, and the departments differed significantly in the surgical procedures performed. After adjustment for case-mix, the patients in Department 2 had a better RF than patients from the other departments. Conclusion: Significant differences in RF and in the fulfilment of the indicator requirement for RF were observed. Since these findings might indicate differences in the quality of performance between participating departments, subsequent audit is recommended. The analyses and results indicate that it is feasible to use PROs as supplementary outcome indicators in the evaluation of the quality of surgical treatment for lung cancer. Our model could serve as a useful foundation for further research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) represents a relatively rare but severe malignancy worldwide. Accumulated studies have emphasized the potential of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) as therapeutic strategies for several human cancers. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether a novel non-coding RNA regulatory circuitry involved in PC. Aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were screened out of microarray database. Following the determination of RNA expression, PANC-1 and BxPC-3 PC cells were adopted, after which the expression of miR-330-5p, PAX8 and LINC00958 were subsequently altered. RNA crosstalk was validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In order to detect whether LINC00958 could act as ceRNA to competitively sponge miR-330-5p and regulate PAX8, subcellular location of LINC00958 and interaction between LINC00958 and miR-330-5p were measured by FISH and RNA pull down respectively. The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, cell invasion, and tumor growth were determined in vitro and in vivo. LINC00958 and PAX8 were up-regulated, while miR-330-5p was down-regulated during PC. LINC00958 mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and LINC00958 competitively sponged miR-330-5p. Upregulated miR-330-5p or downregulated PAX8 inhibited the EMT process as well as the invasion and metastasis ability of the PC cells. Moreover, the results indicated that miR-330-5p negatively targeted PAX8, and LINC00958 ultimately showcasing its ability to bind to miR-330-5p through its interaction with AGO2. Therefore, silencing of LINC00958 may bind to miR-330-5p to inhibit PAX8 in a competitive fashion, thereby preventing the progression of PC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To explore for fatigue-related regions and the radiotherapy (RT) dose-fatigue relationship in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) survivors. Methods: Eighty disease-free NPC survivors completed the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck module (MDASI-HN) after RT. Fatigue was evaluated by the MDASI-HN fatigue item (MDASI-HN-F) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTC-AE), between 6 and 36 months after RT to determine the presence of chronic fatigue. Skull base MRIs and planning CT/RT dose were retrievable for 56 patients. Dosimetric data were extracted for 10 MRI-defined potential fatigue at-risk structures (FARS): brainstem (BS), pituitary gland (PG), hypothalamus (HT), basal ganglia, internal capsule, pineal gland, sub-thalamic nuclei, thalamus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus (HC). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to identify dose-volume effects associated with chronic fatigue. Results: 56 pts formed the cohort. Thirty patients (54%) reported any fatigue per MDASI-HN-F. Thirty-three pts (59%) had any fatigue by CTC-AE. The maximum point doses (Dmax) for PG, BS, HC, and HT were numerically higher in patients with fatigue. Dmax and Dmean of the PG were significantly higher in patients with chronic fatigue, p ≤ 0.01. A dose-volume threshold of PG V52 Gy ≥16% (LogWorth 2.4, AUC 0.7) was identified on RPA, and potential sensitivity to the PG doses was observed in younger patients (<53 years-old). Conclusion: A dose-fatigue relationship was identified for the pituitary gland, both patient-reported and observer ratings. We recommend limiting the Dmax of PG to <54 Gy and V52 Gy to <16%, particularly in young NPC patients, during plan optimization when achievable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Guidelines advise multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before repeat biopsy in patients with negative systematic biopsy (SB) and a suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa), enabling MRI targeted biopsy (TB). No consensus exists regarding which of the three available techniques of TB should be preferred. Objective: To compare detection rates of overall PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa) for the three MRI-based TB techniques. Design, setting, and participants: Multicenter randomised controlled trial, including 665 men with prior negative SB and a persistent suspicion of PCa, conducted between 2014 and 2017 in two nonacademic teaching hospitals and an academic hospital. Intervention: All patients underwent 3-T mpMRI evaluated with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) version 2. If imaging demonstrated PIRADS ≥3 lesions, patients were randomised 1:1:1 for one TB technique: MRI-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion TB (FUS-TB), cognitive registration TRUS TB (COG-TB), or in-bore MRI TB (MRI-TB). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Primary (overall PCa detection) and secondary (csPCa detection [Gleason score ≥3 + 4]) outcomes were compared using Pearson chi-square test. Results and limitations: On mpMRI, 234/665 (35%) patients had PIRADS ≥3 lesions and underwent TB. There were no significant differences in the detection rates of overall PCa (FUS-TB 49%, COG-TB 44%, MRI-TB 55%, p = 0.4). PCa detection rate differences were −5% between FUS-TB and MRI-TB (p = 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] −21% to 11%), 6% between FUS-TB and COG-TB (p = 0.5, 95% CI −10% to 21%), and −11% between COG-TB and MRI-TB (p = 0.17, 95% CI −26% to 5%). There were no significant differences in the detection rates of csPCa (FUS-TB 34%, COG-TB 33%, MRI-TB 33%, p > 0.9). Differences in csPCa detection rates were 2% between FUS-TB and MRI-TB (p = 0.8, 95% CI −13% to 16%), 1% between FUS-TB and COG-TB (p > 0.9, 95% CI −14% to 16%), and 1% between COG-TB and MRI-TB (p > 0.9, 95% CI −14% to 16%). The main study limitation was a low rate of PIRADS ≥3 lesions on mpMRI, causing underpowering for primary outcome. Conclusions: We found no significant differences in the detection rates of (cs)PCa among the three MRI-based TB techniques. Patient summary: In this study, we compared the detection rates of (aggressive) prostate cancer among men with prior negative biopsies and a persistent suspicion of cancer using three different techniques of targeted biopsy based on magnetic resonance imaging. We found no significant differences in the detection rates of (aggressive) prostate cancer among the three techniques. In a repeat biopsy setting, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-based targeted biopsy has a high detection rate of (clinically significant) prostate cancer. There were no significant differences in the detection rates of (clinically significant) prostate cancer among three techniques of mpMRI-based targeted biopsy. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Abstract": "Background: There is growing interest to implement multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and MR-guided biopsy (MRGB) for biopsy-naïve men with suspected prostate cancer. Objective: Primary objective was to compare and evaluate an MRI pathway and a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB) pathway in biopsy-naïve men with prostate-specific antigen levels of ≥3 ng/ml. Design, setting, and population: A prospective, multicenter, powered, comparative effectiveness study included 626 biopsy-naïve patients (from February 2015 to February 2018). Intervention: All patients underwent prebiopsy mpMRI followed by systematic TRUSGB. Men with suspicious lesions on mpMRI also underwent MRGB prior to TRUSGB. MRGB was performed using the in-bore approach. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as grade group ≥2 (Gleason score ≥3 + 4) in any core. The main secondary objectives were the number of men who could avoid biopsy after nonsuspicious mpMRI, the number of biopsy cores taken, and oncologic follow-up. Differences in proportions were tested using McNemar's test with adjusted Wald confidence intervals for differences of proportions with matched pairs. Results and limitations: The MRI pathway detected csPCa in 159/626 (25%) patients and insignificant prostate cancer (insignPCa) in 88/626 patients (14%). TRUSGB detected csPCa in 146/626 patients (23%) and insignPCa in 155/626 patients (25%). Relative sensitivity of the MRI pathway versus the TRUSGB pathway was 1.09 for csPCa (p = 0.17) and 0.57 for insignPCa (p < 0.0001). The total number of biopsy cores reduced from 7512 to 849 (–89%). The MRI pathway enabled biopsy avoidance in 309/626 (49%) patients due to nonsuspicious mpMRI. Immediate TRUSGB detected csPCa in only 3% (10/309) of these patients, increasing to 4% (13/309) with 1-yr follow-up. At the same time, TRUSGB would overdetect insignPCa in 20% (63/309). “Focal saturation” by four additional perilesional cores to MRGB improved the detection of csPCa in 21/317 (7%) patients. Compared with the literature, our proportion of nonsuspicious mpMRI cases is significantly higher (27–36% vs 49%) and that of equivocal cases is lower (15–28% vs 6%). This is probably due to the high-quality standard in this study. Therefore, a limitation is the duplication of these results in less experienced centers. Conclusions: In biopsy-naïve men, the MRI pathway compared with the TRUSGB pathway results in an identical detection rate of csPCa, with significantly fewer insignPCa cases. In this high-quality standard study, almost half of men have nonsuspicious MRI, which is higher compared with other studies. Not performing TRUS biopsy is at the cost of missing csPCa only in 4%. Patient summary: We compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MRI-guided biopsy against standard transrectal ultrasound biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men. Our results show that patients can benefit from MRI because biopsy may be omitted in half of men, and fewer indolent cancers are detected, without compromising the detection of harmful disease. Men also need fewer needles to make a diagnosis. In biopsy-naïve patients, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pathway compared with a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy pathway significantly reduces the detection rate of insignificant prostate cancer without impairing the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer. There is a potential to reduce the number of men requiring biopsy after nonsuspicious MRI to half, with an acceptable underdetection rate of 4%. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The tumor-promoting rearrangement of the lungs facilitates the process of cancer cell survival in a foreign microenvironment and enables their protection against immune defense. The study aimed to define the fingerprint of the early rearrangement of the lungs via the proteomic profiling of the lung tissue in the experimental model of tumor metastasis in a murine 4T1 mammary adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods: The studies were performed on 7-8-week-old BALB/c female mice. Viable 4T1 cancer cells were orthotopically inoculated into the right mammary fat pad. The experiment was performed in the early phase of the tumor metastasis one and two weeks after cancer cell inoculation. The comparative analysis of protein profiles was carried out with the aid of the two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Proteins, of which expression differed significantly, were identified using nano-liquid chromatography coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometry (nanoLC/hybrid ion trap- Orbitrap XL Discovery). Results: Palpable primary tumors were noted in the 2 nd week after cancer cell inoculation. The investigated period preceded the formation of numerous macrometastases in the lungs, however the metastasis-promoting changes were visible very early. Primary tumor-induced inflammation developed in the lungs as early as after the 1 st week and progressed during the 2 nd week, accompanied by increased concentration of 2-OH-E + , an oxidative stress marker, and imbalance in nitric oxide metabolites, pointing to endothelium dysfunction. The early proteomic changes in the lungs in the 1 st week after 4T1 cell inoculation resulted in the reorganization of lung tissue structure [actin, cytoplasmic 1 (Actb), tubulin beta chain (Tubb5), lamin-B1 (Lmnb1), serine protease inhibitor A3K (Serpina3k)] and activation of defense mechanisms [selenium-binding protein 1 (Selenbp1), endoplasmin (Hsp90b1), stress 70 protein, mitochondrial (Hspa9), heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (Hsp90ab1)], but also modifications in metabolic pathways [glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase X (G6pdx), ATP synthase subunit beta, mitochondrial (Atp5b), L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain (Ldhb)]. Further development of the solid tumor after the 2 nd week following cancer cell inoculation, secretion of prolific tumor-derived factors as well as the presence of the increasing number of circulating cancer cells and extravasation processes further impose reorganization of the lung tissue [Actb, vimentin (Vim), clathrin light chain A (Clta)], altering additional metabolic pathways [annexin A5 (Anxa5), Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (Arhgdib), complement 1 Q subcomponent-binding protein, mitochondrial (C1qbp), 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta (Ywhaz), peroxiredoxin-6 (Prdx6), chitinase-like protein 4 (Chi3l4), reticulocalbin-1 (Rcn1), EF-hand domain-containing protein D2 (Efhd2), calumenin (Calu)]. Interestingly, many of differentially expressed proteins were involved in calcium homeostasis (Rcn1, Efhd2, Calu, Actb, Vim, Lmnb1, Clta, Tubb5, Serpina3k, Hsp90b1, Hsp90ab1, Hspa9. G6pdx, Atp5b, Anxa5, Arhgdib, Ywhaz). Conclusion: The analysis enabled revealing the importance of calcium signaling during the early phase of metastasis development, early cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix reorganization, activation of defense mechanisms and metabolic adaptations. It seems that the tissue response is an interplay between pro- and anti-metastatic mechanisms accompanied by inflammation, oxidative stress and dysfunction of the barrier endothelial cells. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Two new triterpenoid saponins, a cycloartane-type triterpenoid saponin (1) and a oleanane-type triterpenoid saponin (2), were isolated from the whole plant of Ligularia przewalskii. Their structures were elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic studies, including IR, UV, HR-ESI-MS, 1D and 2D NMR experiments. ( 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, DEPT, 1 H- 1 H COSY, HMBC, HSQC, and NOESY). Their cytotoxic activities were evaluated against six human cancer (HeLa, HepG2, SGC7901, MDA231, HL60, and Lewis) cell lines in vitro using MTT assay. As a result, two triterpenoid saponins showed potent cytotoxic activities against six tumors cell lines and with broad spectrum activities against six human cancer, with IC 50 values from 8.40 to 24.39 μM. The cytotoxic activities of 2 are more potent. © 2019 Phytochemical Society of Europe",

    "Abstract": "The new era of immunotherapy in cancer has led to a dramatical increase in patients survival but also to the emergence of a new type of immune-mediated toxicities mimicking known diseases but with special features. As the spectrum of checkpoint inhibitors is widening to many types of cancer expressing histological signs of immune blockade, new subtypes of immune-related adverse events are meant to be discovered and classified and among them new life-threatening situations that need to be quickly identified and require urgent treatment. We here report a case of refractory arterial hypotension with fever leading to diagnosis of combined immune-related adverse events associating hypophysitis, thyroiditis and colitis complicated by refractory arterial hypotension with fever.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: Full-field digital mammography (FFDM) is the predominant breast cancer screening exam used. However, with the emergence of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) the radiologists could improve early recognition of breast cancer signs. In this scenario, the detection of architectural distortion (AD) is still a challenging task. ADs are very subtle contraction of the breast parenchyma that could represent the earliest manifestation of cancer, assessing at present 50% of missed cases. Methods: This paper proposes a new paradigm to detect AD in DBT exams by a cross-cutting approach exploiting the 3-dimensionality of the imaging modality. After locating AD candidates in each DBT slice, the suspicious spots are tracked in cross-slice direction and then characterized in terms of neighboring texture. In this approach, which mimics radiologist's scrolling down over zoomed slices, we reduce the amount of uninformative signs collected in DBT exams by preserving the large variability of AD appearance. Results: Using 37 sets of DBT slices containing at least one AD locus indicated by a radiologist, the proposed methodology reaches an AUC of 0.84, with only one false negative exam at sensitivity of 0.9. Conclusions: The results show that the proposed algorithm can be a promising tool for the automatic detection of AD locii. Future work will address the extension of the dataset of DBT slices as well the improvement of algorithm performance toward the application in the clinical practice. © 2019",
