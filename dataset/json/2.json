    "Abstract": "Aim: The main objective of the study was to describe the use of skin fold advancement flaps (SFAFs) and other reconstructive techniques for closure of large skin defects following mammary tumor excision in dogs. Materials and Methods: Twelve dogs underwent reconstruction of large ventral skin defects following mammary tumor excision with wide margins. Skin fold flaps (flank fold flap and elbow fold flap) were elevated from the flank and elbow region, respectively, and transposed and sutured onto the large ventral skin defect following mastectomy in all the dogs. In addition to the skin fold flaps, other reconstructive techniques such as undermining, walking sutures, and tension-relieving suture techniques were followed during surgery in the closure of large skin defects without skin tension and compromising limb mobility. The skin flap viability was assessed subjectively by gross observation of the flap such as color, temperature, capillary perfusion, and cosmetic appearance, and scoring (1-4) was done. Tissue samples were collected from a surgical site on days 3, 6, and 12 post-operatively for histopathological evaluation and healing status of the skin flap. Results: All the surgical wounds healed primarily, without any major complications and the skin flap remained healthy throughout the healing process post-operatively. Distal flap necrosis was noticed in one case and necrosis of skin flap between two suture lines was noticed in another case in which the necrotized distal portion healed by secondary intention after 7 days. The mean survival of subdermal plexus flap in the above cases was 98% which was a subjective evaluation based on surface area of the skin defect measured by Image 'J software and the flap dimensions. The average healing of skin flap in days was 14.91±0.86. Conclusion: The SFAFs along with other reconstructive techniques help in the reconstruction of large ventral skin defects following mastectomy in dogs without much compromising limb mobility. © Sadhasivan, et al.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Breast cancer is a common cause of death among women in Burkina Faso. The aim of this study was to determine a descriptive profile of 80 women and establish a description of risk factors associated with breast cancer in these women. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited women with breast cancer in Ouagadougou. Teaching Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo in Burkina Faso from January 2015 to February 2016. We have collected data on socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive status, clinical information, treatment and molecular characteristics. Results: The average age of the study population was 48.2±12.4 years. Family history of breast cancer was reported in 18.75% of the studied participants against 16.25% family history for other types of cancer. Patients from urban areas represented 87.5% of our studied population with 58.75% of household, multiparous (55.0%), no aborts status (56.2%), post-menopausal women (53.75%), no oral contraception (63.75%), regular menstrual cycle (71.25%) and the prevalence of obesity was 12.5%. The clinical and molecular characteristics showed that left-sided breast cancer accounted for 51.25 %, high grade (II and III) represented 93.75 % of cases and the majority of tumors were infiltrating ductal carcinomas (93.75%) with stages III and IV accounted for 50.0%. Conclusion: This study described the distribution of risks factors in a population of breast cancer women. Although more research are needed to support these findings, a clear understanding of risk factors associated with breast cancer would contribute to significantly reduce breast cancer incidence and mortality in Burkina Faso. © Hierrhum Aboubacar Bambara et al.",

    "Abstract": "A mutation in the promoter of the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) gene is the most frequent noncoding mutation in cancer. The mutation drives unusual monoallelic expression of TERT, allowing immortalization. Here, we find that DNA methylation of the TERT CpG island (CGI) is also allele-specific in multiple cancers. The expressed allele is hypomethylated, which is opposite to cancers without TERT promoter mutations. The continued presence of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) on the inactive allele suggests that histone marks of repressed chromatin may be causally linked to high DNA methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, TERT promoter DNA containing 5-methyl-CpG has much increased affinity for PRC2 in vitro. Thus, CpG methylation and histone marks appear to collaborate to maintain the two TERT alleles in different epigenetic states in TERT promoter mutant cancers. Finally, in several cancers, DNA methylation levels at the TERT CGI correlate with altered patient survival. The promoter for a telomerase gene (TERT) is the third most frequently mutated site in cancer. These mutations drive unusual expression of TERT from a single allele, allowing unceasing cell division. Stern et al. identify modifications of the promoter that appear to collaborate to maintain this expression pattern in these cancers. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in BRAF are believed to initiate serrated colorectal cancers; however, the mechanisms of BRAF-driven colon cancer are unclear. We find that oncogenic BRAF paradoxically suppresses stem cell renewal and instead promotes differentiation. Correspondingly, tumor formation is inefficient in BRAF-driven mouse models of colon cancer. By reducing levels of differentiation via genetic manipulation of either of two distinct differentiation-promoting factors (Smad4 or Cdx2), stem cell activity is restored in BRAF V600E intestines, and the oncogenic capacity of BRAF V600E is amplified. In human patients, we observe that reduced levels of differentiation in normal tissue is associated with increased susceptibility to serrated colon tumors. Together, these findings help resolve the conditions necessary for BRAF-driven colon cancer initiation. Additionally, our results predict that genetic and/or environmental factors that reduce tissue differentiation will increase susceptibility to serrated colon cancer. These findings offer an opportunity to identify susceptible individuals by assessing their tissue-differentiation status. Despite high frequency in serrated colon tumors, BRAF V600E inefficiently drives tumorigenesis in mouse models, and paradoxically, BRAF V600E triggers stem cell loss. BRAF-driven tumorigenesis increases in genetic models that reduce differentiation and restore stem cell activity. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of BRAF V600E -driven colon cancer initiation. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "The Warburg effect, characterized by increased glucose uptake and lactate production, is a well-known universal across cancer cells and other proliferating cells. PKM2, a splice isoformof the pyruvate kinase (PK) specifically expressed in these cells, serves as a major regulator of this metabolic reprogramming with an adjustable activity subjected to numerous allosteric effectors and posttranslational modifications. Here, we have identified a posttranslational modification on PKM2, O-GlcNAcylation, which specifically targets Thr 405 and Ser 406 , residues of the region encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 10 in cancer cells. We show that PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation is up-regulated in various types of human tumor cells and patient tumor tissues. Themodification destabilized the active tetrameric PKM2, reduced PK activity, and led to nuclear translocation of PKM2.We also observed that the modification was associated with an increased glucose consumption and lactate production and enhanced level of lipid and DNA synthesis, indicating that O-GlcNAcylation promotes the Warburg effect. In vivo experiments showed that blocking PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation attenuated tumor growth. Thus, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation is a regulatory mechanism for PKM2 in cancer cells and serves as a bridge between PKM2 and metabolic reprogramming typical of the Warburg effect.",

    "Abstract": "Large, multidimensional cancer datasets provide a resource that can be mined to identify candidate therapeutic targets for specific subgroups of tumors. Here, we analyzed human breast cancer data to identify transcriptional programs associated with tumors bearing specific genetic driver alterations. Using an unbiased approach, we identified thousands of genes whose expression was enriched in tumors with specific genetic alterations. However, expression of the vast majority of these genes was not enriched if associations were analyzed within individual breast tumor molecular subtypes, across multiple tumor types, or after gene expression was normalized to account for differences in proliferation or tumor lineage. Together with linear modeling results, these findings suggest that most transcriptional programs associated with specific genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors are highly context-dependent and are predominantly linked to differences in proliferation programs between distinct breast cancer subtypes. We demonstrate that such proliferation-dependent gene expression dominates tumor transcriptional programs relative to matched normal tissues. However, we also identified a relatively small group of cancer-associated genes that are both proliferation- and lineage-independent. A subset of these genes are attractive candidate targets for combination therapy because they are essential in breast cancer cell lines, druggable, enriched in stem-like breast cancer cells, and resistant to chemotherapy-induced down-regulation.",

    "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the deadliest form of this disease, lacks a targeted therapy. TNBC tumors that fail to respond to chemotherapy are characterized by a repressed IFN/signal transducer and activator of transcription (IFN/STAT) gene signature and are often enriched for cancer stem cells (CSCs). We have found that human mammary epithelial cells that undergo an epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) following transformation acquire CSC properties. These mesenchymal/CSCs have a significantly repressed IFN/STAT gene expression signature and an enhanced ability to migrate and form tumor spheres. Treatment with IFN-beta (IFN-β) led to a less aggressive epithelial/non-CSC-like state, with repressed expression of mesenchymal proteins (VIMENTIN, SLUG), reduced migration and tumor sphere formation, and reexpression of CD24 (a surface marker for non-CSCs), concomitant with an epithelium-like morphology. The CSC-like properties were correlated with high levels of unphosphorylated IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (U-ISGF3), which was previously linked to resistance to DNA damage. Inhibiting the expression of IRF9 (the DNA-binding component of U-ISGF3) reduced the migration of mesenchymal/CSCs. Here we report a positive translational role for IFN-β, as gene expression profiling of patient-derived TNBC tumors demonstrates that an IFN-β metagene signature correlates with improved patient survival, an immune response linked with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and a repressed CSC metagene signature. Taken together, our findings indicate that repressed IFN signaling in TNBCs with CSC-like properties is due to high levels of U-ISGF3 and that treatment with IFN-β reduces CSC properties, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to treat drug-resistant, highly aggressive TNBC tumors.",

    "Abstract": "It was considered processes transmutation of genome mechanism from the point of view of thermodynamics, biophysics, and biochemistry. Just it was explained mechanisms maintenance stability Internal Energy of Stationary State an able-bodied organism according first law of thermodynamics. Besides it was considered some negative influences on an organism of solar radiation causing germination viruses. Hence it was described mechanisms normal development of an organism reflecting activity of cellular genomes via generating cellular divisions. The links between genomic mechanisms and mechanisms maintenance stability Internal Energy of an organism and cells of an organism exert activity stem cells which induce cells types division in healthy tissues. The local violation these links due to viral affection causes local tissue transitions normal genomic cycle into genomic cycle of benign neoplasm, i.e., the transition of genomic link due to viral affection of cellular genomic link leading to forming benign neoplasm. The mechanism of these transformations in cellular genome was described from point of views of thermodynamics, biophysics, and biochemistry. Also, it was elucidated the cause that genomic mechanism of benign neoplasm don’t break Stationary State of an organism. Furthermore, it was described the viral affecting genomic link of cells in benign neoplasm causing mechanism transmutation benign neoplasm into cancer with forming Warburg effect mechanism. The forming cancer metabolism creates Quasi-Stationary State of cancer disease organism. © 2017 The Authors.",

    "Abstract": "Hypoxia as one characteristic hallmark of solid tumors has been demonstrated to be involved in cancer metastasis and progression, induce severe resistance to oxygen-dependent therapies, and hamper the transportation of theranostic agents. To address these issues, an oxygen-self-produced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) nanoplatform involving a modified fluorocarbon (FC)-chain-mediated oxygen delivery protocol has been established to realize highly efficient SDT against hypoxic pancreatic cancer. In this nanoplatform, mesopores and FC chains of FC-chain-functionalized hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticle carriers can provide sufficient storage capacity and binding sites for sonosensitizers (IR780) and oxygen, respectively. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the nanoplatform involving this distinctive oxygen delivery protocol indeed breaks the hypoxia-specific transportation barriers, supplies sufficient oxygen to hypoxic PANC-1 cells especially upon exposure to ultrasound irradiation, and relieves hypoxia. Consequently, hypoxia-induced resistance to SDT is inhibited and sufficient highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced to kill PANC-1 cells and shrink hypoxic PANC-1 pancreatic cancer. This distinctive FC-chain-mediated oxygen delivery method provides an avenue to hypoxia oxygenation and holds great potential in mitigating hypoxia-induced resistance to those oxygen-depleted therapies, e.g., photodynamic therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "In vivo the application of optogenetic manipulation in deep tissue is seriously obstructed by the limited penetration depth of visible light that is continually applied to activate a photoactuator. Herein, we designed a versatile upconversion optogenetic nanosystem based on a blue-light-mediated heterodimerization module and rare-earth upconversion nanoparticles (UCNs). The UCNs worked as a nanotransducer to convert external deep-tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light to local blue light to noninvasively activate photoreceptors for optogenetic manipulation in vivo. In this, we demonstrated that deeply penetrating NIR light could be used to control the apoptotic signaling pathway of cancer cells in both mammalian cells and mice by UCNs. We believe that this interesting NIR-light-responsive upconversion optogenetic nanotechnology has significant application potentials for both basic research and clinical applications in vivo. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Aneuploidy disrupts cellular homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological responses and adaptation to aneuploidy are not well understood. Deciphering these mechanisms is important because aneuploidy is associated with diseases, including intellectual disability and cancer. Although tumors and mammalian aneuploid cells, including several cancer cell lines, show altered levels of sphingolipids, the role of sphingolipids in aneuploidy remains unknown. Here, we show that ceramides and long-chain bases, sphingolipid molecules that slow proliferation and promote survival, are increased by aneuploidy. Sphingolipid levels are tightly linked to serine synthesis, and inhibiting either serine or sphingolipid synthesis can specifically impair the fitness of aneuploid cells. Remarkably, the fitness of aneuploid cells improves or deteriorates upon genetically decreasing or increasing ceramides, respectively. Combined targeting of serine and sphingolipid synthesis could be exploited to specifically target cancer cells, the vast majority of which are aneuploid. Hwang et al. demonstrate that aneuploid yeast cells rely on the synthesis of the amino acid serine for their viability. Serine is used for the synthesis of sphingolipids that control the fitness of aneuploid cells. Aneuploid cells are vulnerable to combined inhibition of serine and sphingolipid biosynthesis. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Our development of multifunctional dual-modal imaging probes aims to integrate the benefits from both second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence (1000-1700 nm) and photoacoustic imaging with an ultimate goal of improving overall cancer diagnosis efficacy. Herein we designed a donor-acceptor chromophore based nanoparticle (DAP) as a dual-modal image contrast agent has strong absorption in the NIR-I window and a strong fluorescence emission peak in the NIR-II region. The dual-modal DAPs composed of D-π-A-π-D-type chromophores were PEGylated through nanoprecipitation. The multifunctional DAP surface was thus available for subsequent bioconjugation of EGFR Affibody (Ac-Cys-Z EGFR:1907 ) to target EGFR-positive cancers. The Affibody-conjugated DAPs appeared as highly monodisperse nanoparticles (∼30 nm) with strong absorption in the NIR-I window (at ca. 680 nm) and an extremely high fluorescence in the NIR-II region (maximum peak at 1000 nm). Consequently, the Affibody-DAPs show significantly enhanced photoacoustic and NIR-II fluorescence contrast effects in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, the Affibody-DAPs have the capability to selectively target EGFR-positive tumors in an FTC-133 subcutaneous mouse model with relatively high photoacoustic and fluorescent signals. By taking advantage of high spatial resolution and excellent temporal resolution, photoacoustic/NIR-II fluorescence imaging with targeted dual-modal contrast agents allows us to specifically image and detect various cancers and diseases in an accurate manner. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the importance of the CD34+CD38- cell population when compared to the CD34+CD38+/low and CD34+CD38+/high leukemic cell sub-populations and to determine its correlations with leukemia characteristics and known prognostic factors, as well as with response to therapy and survival. METHODS: Two hundred bone marrow samples were obtained at diagnosis from 200 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were studied between September 2008 and December 2010 at our Institution (Hematology Department, Lyon, France). The CD34/CD38 cell profile was analyzed by multiparameter flowcytometry approach using 8C panels and FACS CANTO and Diva software (BD Bioscience). RESULTS: We analyzed CD34 and CD38 expression in bone marrow samples of 200 AML patients at diagnosis, and investigated the prognostic value of the most immature CD34+CD38- population. Using a cut-off value of 1% of CD34+CD38- from total \"bulk leukemic cells\" we found that a high (> 1%) level of CD34+CD38- blasts at diagnosis was correlated with advanced age, adverse cytogenetics as well as with a lower rate of complete response after induction and shorter disease-free survival. In a multivariate analysis considering age, leukocytosis, the % of CD34+ blasts cells and the standardized cytogenetic and molecular risk subgroups, a percentage of CD34+CD38- leukemic cells < 1% was an independent predictor of DFS [HR = 2.8 (1.02-7.73), P = 0.04] and OS [HR = 2.65 (1.09-6.43), P = 0.03]. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results show that a CD34/CD38 \"backbone\" for leukemic cell analysis by multicolour flowcytometry at diagnosis provides useful prognostic information. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Intracranial neoplasia is frequently encountered in dogs. After a presumptive diagnosis of intracranial neoplasia is established based on history, clinical signs and advanced imaging characteristics, the decision to treat and which treatment to choose must be considered. The objective of this study is to report survival times (ST) for dogs with intracranial meningiomas and gliomas treated with surgical resection alone (SRA), to identify potential prognostic factors affecting survival, and to compare the results with the available literature. Medical records of 29 dogs with histopathologic confirmation of intracranial meningiomas and gliomas treated with SRA were retrospectively reviewed. For each dog, signalment, clinical signs, imaging findings, type of surgery, treatment, histological evaluation, and ST were obtained. Twenty-nine dogs with a histological diagnosis who survived >7 days after surgery were included. There were 15 (52%) meningiomas and 14 (48%) gliomas. All tumors had a rostrotentorial location. At the time of the statistical analysis, only two dogs were alive. Median ST for meningiomas was 422 days (mean, 731 days; range, 10-2735 days). Median ST for gliomas was 66 days (mean, 117 days; range, 10-730 days). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that ST was significantly longer for meningiomas than for gliomas (P<0.05). A negative correlation between the presence of a midline shift and ST (P=0.037) and ventricular compression and ST (P=0.038) was observed for meningiomas. For gliomas, there were no significant associations between ST and any of the variables evaluated. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that, for dogs that survived >7 days postoperatively, SRA might be an appropriate treatment, particularly for meningiomas, when radiation therapy is not readily available. Also, the presence of midline shift and ventricular compression might be negative prognostic factors for dogs with meningiomas. © 2018, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

    "Abstract": "MXenes, an emerging family of graphene-analogues two-dimensional (2D) materials, have attracted continuous and tremendous attention in many application fields because of their intrinsic physiochemical properties and high performance in versatile applications. In this work, we report on the construction of tantalum carbide (Ta4C3) MXene-based composite nanosheets for multiple imaging-guided photothermal tumor ablation, which has been achieved by rational choice of the composition of MXenes and their surface functionalization. A redox reaction was activated on the surface of tantalum carbide (Ta4C3) MXene for in situ growth of manganese oxide nanoparticles (MnOx/Ta4C3) based on the reducing surface of the nanosheets. The tantalum components of MnOx/Ta4C3 acted as the high-performance contrast agents for contrast-enhanced computed tomography, and the integrated MnOx component functionalized as the tumor microenvironment-responsive contrast agents for T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The photothermal-conversion performance of MnOx/Ta4C3 composite nanosheets not only has achieved contrast-enhanced photoacoustic imaging, but also realized the significant tumor-growth suppression by photothermal hyperthermia. This work broadens the biomedical applications of MXenes, not only by the fabrication of family members of biocompatible MXenes, but also by the development of functionalization strategies of MXenes for cancer-theranostic applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Cell migration is studied with the traditional focus on protrusion-driven cell body displacement, while less is known on morphodynamics of individual protrusions themselves, especially in fibrous environments mimicking extracellular matrix. Here, using suspended fibers, we report integrative and multiscale abilities to study protrusive behavior independent of cell body migration. By manipulating the diameter of fibers in orthogonal directions, we constrain cell migration along large diameter (2 μm) base fibers, while solely allowing cells to sense, initiate, and mature protrusions on orthogonally deposited high-curvature/low diameter (∼100, 200, and 600 nm) protrusive fibers and low-curvature (∼300 and 600 nm width) protrusive flat ribbons. In doing so, we report a set of morphodynamic metrics that precisely quantitate protrusion dynamics. Protrusion growth and maturation occur by rapid broadening at the base to achieve long lengths, a behavior dramatically influenced by curvature. While flat ribbons universally induce the formation of broad and long protrusions, we quantitatively protrutype protrusive behavior of two highly invasive cancer cell lines and find breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231) to exhibit sensitivity to fiber curvature higher than that of brain glioblastoma DBTRG-05MG. Furthermore, while actin and microtubules localize within protrusions of all sizes, we quantify protrusion size-driven localization of vimentin and, contrary to current understanding, report that vimentin is not required to form protrusions. Using multiple protrusive fibers, we quantify high coordination between hierarchical branches of individual protrusions and describe how the spatial configuration of multiple protrusions regulates cell migratory state. Finally, we describe protrusion-driven shedding and collection of cytoplasmic debris. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Continuous BRAF inhibition of BRAF mutant melanomas triggers a series of cell state changes that lead to therapy resistance and escape from immune control before establishing acquired resistance genetically. We used genome-wide transcriptomics and single-cell phenotyping to explore the response kinetics to BRAF inhibition for a panel of patient-derived BRAFV600-mutant melanoma cell lines. A subset of plastic cell lines, which followed a trajectory covering multiple known cell state transitions, provided models for more detailed biophysical investigations. Markovmodeling revealed that the cell state transitions were reversible and mediated by both Lamarckian induction and nongenetic Darwinian selection of drug-tolerant states. Single-cell functional proteomics revealed activation of certain signaling networks shortly after BRAF inhibition, and before the appearance of drug-resistant phenotypes. Drug targeting those networks, in combination with BRAF inhibition, halted the adaptive transition and led to prolonged growth inhibition in multiple patient-derived cell lines.",

    "Abstract": "Epigenetic targeting of cancer is a recent effort to manipulate the gene without destroying the genetic material. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is one of the enzymes associated with the chromatin for post-translational modifications, where it demethylates lysine amino acid in the chromatin H3 tail. Many studies showed that inhibiting LSD1 could potentially be used to treat cancer epigenetically. LSD1 is associated with its corepressor protein CoREST, and it uses tetrahydrofolate as a co-factor to accept CH2 from the demethylation process. In this study, the co-crystallized co-factor tetrahydrofolate was utilized to determine possible binding regions in the active center of the LSD1/CoREST complex. Also, the flexibility of the complex has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulation and subsequent analysis by clustering and principal component analysis. This research supported other studies and showed that LSD1/CoREST complex exists in two main conformational structures: open and closed. Furthermore, this study showed that tetrahydrofolate stably binds to the LSD1/CoREST complex, in its open conformation, at its entrance. It then binds to the core of the complex, inducing the closed conformation. Furthermore, the interactions of tetrahydrofolate to these two binding regions and the corresponding binding mode of tetrahydrofolate were investigated to be used in structure-based drug design. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Intestinal immune homeostasis is preserved by commensal bacteria interacting with the host to generate a balanced array of cytokines that are essential for wound repair and for combatting infection. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which can lead to colitis-associated cancer (CAC), is thought to involve chronic microbial irritation following a breach of the mucosal intestinal epithelium. However, the innate immune pathways responsible for regulating these inflammatory processes remain to be fully clarified. Here, we show that commensal bacteria influence STING signaling predominantly in mononuclear phagocytes to produce both pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as anti-inflammatory IL-10. Enterocolitis, manifested through loss of IL-10, was completely abrogated in the absence of STING. Intestinal inflammation was less severe in the absence of cGAS, possibly suggesting a role for cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) indirectly regulating STING signaling. Our data shed insight into the causes of inflammation and provide a potential therapeutic target for prevention of IBD. Ahn et al. find a key role for STING signaling in controlling gut homeostasis. Loss of STING reverses colitis observed in the absence of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in mice. The interface of commensal bacteria with mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) containing STING is responsible for stimulating pro- as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Calcium-dependent cardiac muscle contraction is regulated by the protein complex troponin. Calcium binds to the N-terminal domain of troponin C (cNTnC) which initiates the process of contraction. Heart failure is a consequence of a disruption of this process. With the prevalence of this condition, a strong need exists to find novel compounds to increase the calcium sensitivity of cNTnC. Desirable are small chemical molecules that bind to the interface between cTnC and the cTnI switch peptide and exhibit calcium sensitizing properties by possibly stabilizing cTnC in an open conformation. To identify novel drug candidates, we employed a structure-based drug discovery protocol that incorporated the use of a relaxed complex scheme (RCS). In preparation for the virtual screening, cNTnC conformations were identified based on their ability to correctly predict known cNTnC binders using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. Following a virtual screen of the National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutic Program database, a small number of molecules were experimentally tested using stopped-flow kinetics and steady-state fluorescence titrations. We identified two novel compounds, 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6,7-chromanediol (NSC600285) and 3-(4-methylphenyl)-7,8-chromanediol (NSC611817), that show increased calcium sensitivity of cTnC in the presence of the regulatory domain of cTnI. The effects of NSC600285 and NSC611817 on the calcium dissociation rate was stronger than that of the known calcium sensitizer bepridil. Thus, we identified a 3-phenylchromane group as a possible key pharmacophore in the sensitization of cardiac muscle contraction. Building on this finding is of interest to researchers working on development of drugs for calcium sensitization. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "There is an urgent need for an effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer (PC). Prostate tumors invariably overexpress prostate surface membrane antigen (PSMA). We designed a nonviral vector, PEI-PEG-DUPA (PPD), comprising polyethylenimine-polyethyleneglycol (PEI-PEG) tethered to the PSMA ligand, 2-[3-(1, 3-dicarboxy propyl)ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA), to treat PC. The purpose of PEI is to bind polyinosinic/polycytosinic acid (polyIC) and allow endosomal release, while DUPA targets PC cells. PolyIC activates multiple pathways that lead to tumor cell death and to the activation of bystander effects that harness the immune system against the tumor, attacking nontargeted neighboring tumor cells and reducing the probability of acquired resistance and disease recurrence. Targeting polyIC directly to tumor cells avoids the toxicity associated with systemic delivery. PPD selectively delivered polyIC into PSMA-overexpressing PC cells, inducing apoptosis, cytokine secretion, and the recruitment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PSMA-overexpressing tumors in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice with partially reconstituted immune systems were significantly shrunken following PPD/polyIC treatment, in all cases. Half of the tumors showed complete regression. PPD/polyIC invokes antitumor immunity, but unlike many immunotherapies does not need to be personalized for each patient. The potent antitumor effects of PPD/polyIC should spur its development for clinical use.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer metastatic spread is life-threatening and caused by circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that are very difficult to precisely capture in vivo. Here we show that two aptamer rings targeting different CTC biomarker epitopes conjugated on dendrimers capture CTCs with enhanced precision even in the presence of 108 interfering cells, or blood cells, and in mice or patient samples when compared with their single aptamer counterparts. The aptamer-conjugate inhibited in vivo metastasis and demonstrated enhanced biostability by resisting biodegradation caused by the endogenous nucleases. The capture arms of the aptamer conjugates could simultaneously and specifically seize two biomarkers (EpCAM and Her2). The double seizure resulted in significant cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and growth inhibition of the captured CTCs. The aptamer-conjugate highly penetrated and accumulated in mouse tumors. This study provides the first conceptual evidence that two aptamer rings, inexpensive but bioequivalent to their antibodies, can be biocompatibly conjugated to specifically capture and down-regulate CTCs in vivo with the enhanced biostability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "There is a pressing need to develop nanoplatforms that integrate multimodal therapeutics to improve treatment responses and prolong the survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mesoporous silica-coated gold nanomaterials have emerged as a novel multifunctional platform combining tunable surface plasmon resonance and mesoporous properties that exhibit multimodality properties in cancer theranostics. However, their reduced radiation-absorption efficiency and limited surface area hinder their further radiochemotherapeutic applications. To address these issues, we designed Janus-structured gold-mesoporous silica nanoparticles using a modified sol-gel method. This multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform was subsequently modified via the conjugation of folic acid for enhanced HCC targeting and internalization. The loaded anticancer agent doxorubicin can be released from the mesopores in a pH-responsive manner, facilitating selective and safe chemotherapy. Additionally, the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy induced synergistic anticancer effects in vitro and exhibited remarkable inhibition of tumor growth in vivo along with significantly reduced systematic toxicity. Additionally, the Janus NPs acted as targeted computed tomography (CT)-imaging agents for HCC diagnosis. Given their better performance in chemoradiotherapy and CT imaging as compared with that of their core-shell counterparts, this new nanoplatform designed with dual functionalities provides a promising strategy for unresectable HCC theranostics. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is a promising adjuvant therapy for cancer treatment. Particle clustering leading to complex magnetic interactions affects the heat generated by MNPs during MH. The heat efficiencies, theoretically predicted, are still poorly understood because of a lack of control of the fabrication of such clusters with defined geometries and thus their functionality. This study aims to correlate the heating efficiency under MH of individually coated iron oxide nanocubes (IONCs) versus soft colloidal nanoclusters made of small groupings of nanocubes arranged in different geometries. The controlled clustering of alkyl-stabilized IONCs is achieved here during the water transfer procedure by tuning the fraction of the amphiphilic copolymer, poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) cumene-terminated, to the nanoparticle surface. It is found that increasing the polymer-to-nanoparticle surface ratio leads to the formation of increasingly large nanoclusters with defined geometries. When compared to the individual nanocubes, we show here that controlled grouping of nanoparticles - so-called \"dimers\" and \"trimers\" composed of two and three nanocubes, respectively - increases specific absorption rate (SAR) values, while conversely, forming centrosymmetric clusters having more than four nanocubes leads to lower SAR values. Magnetization measurements and Monte Carlo-based simulations support the observed SAR trend and reveal the importance of the dipolar interaction effect and its dependence on the details of the particle arrangements within the different clusters. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Physiologic turnover of interstitial collagen is mediated by a sequential pathway in which collagen is fragmented by pericellular collagenases, endocytosed by collagen receptors, and routed to lysosomes for degradation by cathepsins. Here, we use intravital microscopy to investigate if malignant tumors, which are characterized by high rates of extracellular matrix turnover, utilize a similar collagen degradation pathway. Tumors of epithelial, mesenchymal, or neural crest origin all display vigorous endocytic collagen degradation. The cells engaged in this process are identified as tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-like cells that degrade collagen in a mannose receptor-dependent manner. Accordingly, mannose-receptor-deficient mice display increased intratumoral collagen. Whole-transcriptome profiling uncovers a distinct extracellular matrix-catabolic signature of these collagen-degrading TAMs. Lineage-ablation studies reveal that collagen-degrading TAMs originate from circulating CCR2+ monocytes. This study identifies a function of TAMs in altering the tumor microenvironment through endocytic collagen turnover and establishes macrophages as centrally engaged in tumor-associated collagen degradation. Madsen et al. identify a population of tumor-associated macrophages with a distinct matrix catabolic signature as key effectors of collagen turnover during invasive tumor growth. These matrix-degrading macrophages are largely derived from CCR2+ monocytes reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment and degrade collagen through mannose receptor-dependent cellular uptake. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Hierarchically porous materials are believed one of the most promising matrix materials due to their unique multimodal pore structures and great application potentials in catalysis, separation, and biomedicine. In this article, a series of hierarchically porous silica nanospheres with adjustable morphologies and pore structures/sizes has been successfully developed by controlling the electrostatic interaction-induced interfacial self-assembly behaviors between anionic block copolymer polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA), cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and tetraethyl orthosilicate. Especially, \"embedded\" structured dual-mesoporous silica nanospheres (E-DMSNs) containing connected large mesopores (&gt;10 nm) and abundant small mesopores (2-3 nm) in the large-pore framework have been prepared for the first time. Moreover, by employing PS-b-PAA with shorter PAA block lengths as template, the morphology conversion of porous silica nanospheres from core-shell structured dual-mesoporous silica nanospheres to well-defined hollow mesoporous silica nanospheres has been achieved. To endow the capability of E-DMSNs as multidrug delivery vehicles, a spatially selective functionalization strategy has been adopted to obtain dual-functionalized E-DMSNs (E-DMSNs-NH 2 /OH) with amino-functionalized large mesopores and hydroxyl-modified small mesopores. Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry analysis shows that the loading amount of curcumin (Cur) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) were about 3.4% and 10.0% in weight, respectively. In addition, the cytotoxicity assay and cellular uptake of DOX@Cur@E-DMSNs-NH 2 /OH on SMMC-7721 cells (human hepatoma cells) have been investigated. Thus, such a simple methodology to synthesize hierarchically porous silica with adjustable morphologies, pore sizes, and pore modifications provides a new pathway for the rational design of antitumor multidrug nanocarriers in further cancer treatment. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapeutic that is used in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers. However, it causes cardiotoxicity partly because of the formation of reactive oxygen species. CYP2J2 is a human cytochrome P450 that is strongly expressed in cardiomyocytes. It converts arachidonic acid (AA) into four different regioisomers of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Using kinetic analyses, we show that AA metabolism by CYP2J2 is modulated by DOX. We show that cytochrome P450 reductase, the redox partner of CYP2J2, metabolizes DOX to 7-deoxydoxorubicin aglycone (7-de-aDOX). This metabolite then binds to CYP2J2 and inhibits and alters the preferred site of metabolism of AA, leading to a change in the ratio of the EET regioisomers. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations indicate that 7-de-aDOX and AA can concurrently bind to the CYP2J2 active site to produce these changes in the site of AA metabolism. To determine if these observations are unique to DOX/7-de-aDOX, we use noncardiotoxic DOX analogues, zorubicin (ZRN) and 5-iminodaunorubicin (5-IDN). ZRN and 5-IDN inhibit CYP2J2-mediated AA metabolism but do not change the ratio of EET regioisomers. Altogether, we demonstrate that DOX and 7-de-aDOX inhibit CYP2J2-mediated AA metabolism and 7-de-aDOX binds close to the active site to alter the ratio of cardioprotective EETs. These mechanistic studies of CYP2J2 can aid in the design of new alternative DOX derivatives. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Beclin-1 (BECN1) is an essential component of macroautophagy. This process is a highly conserved survival mechanism that recycles damaged cellular components or pathogens by encasing them in a bilayer vesicle that fuses with a lysosome to allow degradation of the vesicular contents. Mutations or altered expression profiles of BECN1 have been linked to various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Viruses, including HIV and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), are also known to specifically target BECN1 as a means of evading host defense mechanisms. Autophagy is regulated by the interaction between BECN1 and Bcl-2, a pro-survival protein in the apoptotic pathway that stabilizes the BECN1 homodimer. Disruption of the homodimer by phosphorylation or competitive binding promotes autophagy through an unknown mechanism. We report here the first recombinant synthesis (3-5 mg/L in an Escherichia coli culture) and characterization of full-length, human BECN1. Our analysis reveals that full-length BECN1 exists as a soluble homodimer (KD ∼ 0.45 μM) that interacts with Bcl-2 (KD = 4.3 ± 1.2 μM) and binds to lipid membranes. Dimerization is proposed to be mediated by a coiled-coil region of BECN1. A construct lacking the C-terminal BARA domain but including the coiled-coil region exhibits a homodimer KD 3.5-fold weaker than that of full-length BECN1, indicating that both the BARA domain and the coiled-coil region of BECN1 contribute to dimer formation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that residues at the C-terminus of the coiled-coil region previously shown to interact with the BARA domain play a key role in dimerization and mutations weaken the interface by ∼5-fold. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect and mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen combined with radioactive seed implantation in the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: Subcutaneous tumor model of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using TE-8 cells was established. Tumor bearing Balb/c(nu/nu) mice (60 mice) were divided into four groups, Cont group that treated with normal oxygen level, HBO group that treated with hyperbaric oxygen, RSI group that treated with radioactive seed implantation, and HBO+RSI group that treated with hyperbaric oxygen combined with radioactive seed implantation. Tumor volume ratio and mean survival time of tumor bearing mice were observed. Pathological changes of tumor tissue after treatment were observed by hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to detect oxidative stress. Apoptosis related proteins were detected by Western blot. Results: After treatment, the tumor volume ratio of HBO+RSI group was 3.51 ±0.80 and was significantly lower than that of Conl group, HBO group, and RSI group (P < 0.05). The mean survival time of HBO+RSI group tumor bearing mice was 62 d and was significantly longer than that in Cont group, HBO group, and RSI group (P < 0.05). HE staining showed that the pathological changes of tumor tissues were most obvious in HBO+RSI group. After treatment, the MDA and Bax levels in nude mice of HBO+ RSI group were significantly higher than those in Cont group, HBO group and RSI group, but the levels of GSH, SOD and Bcl-2 were signifieandy lower than those of Cont group, HBO group and RSI group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Hyperbaric oxygen combined with radioactive seed implantation could slow tumor growth and increase survival time of tumor bearing mice. The possible mechanism is that hyperbaric oxygen combined with radioactive seed implantation can improve the oxidative stress response and the expression of apoptosis protein in tumor bearing nude mice.

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer ranks second among the most common causes of cancer death in China. More than 90% of gastric cancer are considered as the ultimate consequence of a longstanding mucosal inflammation. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading etiological cause of gastritis, which may result in atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia of the gastric mucosa, and finally the occurrence of gastric cancer (Correa's Cascade of intestinal type of gastric cancer). This well-understood natural history provides the rationale for primary and secondary cancer prevention strategies. A large body of evidence demonstrates that combined strategies of primary (H. pylori eradication) and secondary (endoscopic screening and surveillance) prevention may prevent or limit the progress of gastric oncogenesis. In this article, the importance of primary prevention of gastric cancer is emphasized. COPYRIGHT © 2017 by the Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Gastroenterology.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor formation and maintenance depend on a small fraction of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that can self-renew and generate a wide variety of differentiated cells. CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, and can represent a reservoir of cancer cells that often cause relapse after treatment. Evidence suggests that CSCs also give rise to metastases. Thyroid hormone (TH) controls a variety of biological processes including the development and functioning of most adult tissues. Recent years has seen the emergence of an intimate link between TH and multiple steps of tumorigenesis. Thyroid hormone controls the balance between the proliferation and differentiation of CSCs, and may thus be a druggable anti-cancer agent. Here, we review current understanding of the effects of TH on colorectal CSCs, including the cross regulatory loops between TH and regulators of CSC stemness. Targeting TH in the tumor microenvironment may improve treatment strategies. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Recurrence of gastric cancer after 10 years of surgical resection is highly rare. There are limited data on the surveillance of patients with gastric cancer after 10 years from gastrectomy. A 50-year-old man presented to the gastroenterology clinic at our hospital for the management of abnormal findings on a routine colonoscopic exam. He had undergone gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer 12 years ago. At presentation, colonoscopic examination revealed asymmetrically edematous and hyperemic mucosal change with luminal narrowing on transverse colon. Abdominal computed tomography showed no evidence of distant metastasis, except for focal bowel wall thickening on transverse colon. He underwent a laparoscopic right-hemicolectomy, and the resected specimen revealed a recurrent and metastatic lesion. We report a case of recurrence of gastric cancer after 10 years from surgical resection with relevant literature review.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on the prognosis of stage II( colon cancer patients with high risk factors. METHODS: Clinicopathological and follow-up data of stage II( colon cancer patients undergoing radical surgery from January 2001 to March 2012 at Gastrointestinal Cancer Center of Peking University Cancer Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (within postoperative 2 month, fluorine uracil as main drugs) on the prognosis of high-risk patients was analyzed. High risk factors were defined as having at least one of the following factors: (1) tumor stage T4; (2) poor differentiation; (3) with vascular cancer embolus; (4) number of harvested lymph node less than 12; (5) complicated with obstruction or perforation. RESULTS: A total of 497 patients with stage II( colon cancer were included in this study, of whom 258 cases(51.9%) had high risk factors, including stage T4 tumor in 80 cases(16.1%), poor differentiation in 80 cases (16.1%), cancer embolus in 37 cases (7.4%), lymph node harvested number less than 12 in 88 cases (17.7%), and obstruction or perforation in 85 cases (17.1%). Among 497 patients, number of cases with 1 to 4 high risk factors was 170 (34.2%), 68 (13.7%), 16 (3.2%) and 4 (0.8%), respectively. The last follow-up time was December 2016. The 5-year overall survival rate of all the 497 patients was 81.7%. The 5-year overall survival rate of 239 patients without high risk factors was 87.0%. The 5-year survival rate in patients with 1 to 4 risk factors was 81.9%, 73.7%, 66.7% and 25.0%, respectively (P=0.001). There was no significant difference in 5-year survival rate between 103 patients with adjuvant chemotherapy and 394 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy (79.6% vs. 82.8%, P=0.814). In patients with high risk factors, 80(31.0%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no significant difference of 5-year survival rate between 80 patients with adjuvant chemotherapy and 178 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy (81.4% vs. 74.7%, P=0.147). Multivariate analysis showed that preoperative CEA level, T4 stage, lymph node harvested number, and tumor differentiation were the independent prognostic factors of patients with stage II( colon cancer (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients with at least one risk factor is quite high in stage II( colon cancer cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy can not prolong the overall survival time of high risk patients.",

    "Abstract": "A newly synthesised zerumbone pendant derivative (ZPD) was studied in human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) for its anticancer properties. ZPD significantly inhibited the growth of human cervical cancer cells with a GI50 value of 6.35 ± 1.30 μM, which also induced morphological changes and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Our data indicated that ZPD actively encouraged programmed cell death in HeLa cells which were confirmed by DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine translocation, increased activity of caspase 3, upregulation of the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3 and downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. ZPD also inhibited cell migration of HeLa cells, decreasing the production of MMP-2,-9 and downregulation of expression of MMPs and pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. Also it is nontoxic to normal rat cardiac myoblasts.

    "Abstract": "The drug delivery application of carbon-based quantum dots is a new platform in the medical field. We report a unique morphological structure called carbon-dots clathrates (C-dotsCL) conjugated with folic acid (FA) for targeted delivery of methotrexate (MTX), an anti-cancer drug under physiological conditions followed by photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic (PDT) treatment on cancer cells. Under physiological milieu, the C-dotsCL–MTX–FA complex are pH-dependent and it can control release the anti-cancer drug in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo studies were also performed by using genetically-induced pancreatic cancer model to comprehend the in vivo pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution pattern of C-dotsCL–MTX–FA complex. The results demonstrated that the CQD was able to deliver high concentration of MTX in tumour tissues in contrast to the non-tumour tissues. The impact of near-infrared (NIR) laser (1064 nm; Nd-YAG) on the CQDs system was found to be extremely effective for the rapid release of MTX in tumour tissues. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by C-dotsCL upon irradiation of NIR laser was evaluated using flow cytometry. After conjugation with the C-dotsCL, the half-life of the MTX drug (t1/2), elimination constant (Kel), area under the curve (AUC) was drastically improved to prove the efficacy of C-dotCL as a powerful drug vehicle. This study has significantly improved the cancer theranostics research using C-dotsCL to act as a multi-functional nanomaterial for imaging and as a drug delivery agent. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",

    "Abstract": "Esophageal cancer is located in the 8th position of the incidence of malignant tumors and the 6th most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the world, while China has the highest incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the predominant histologic type of esophageal cancer in China, accounts for about 90%. Despite recent improvement of surgical techniques and philosophy, however, the prognosis of ESCC patients treated with surgery is still poor, and 5-year survival remains unsatisfactorily low. So far, the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is still unclear, and effective prevention is also out of the question. To find the main factors affecting the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and to improve the survival of patients, are the main directions of all scholars. Postoperative pathology of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is considered to be one of the most important predictors of prognosis. Currently, the evaluation of postoperative esophageal prognosis mainly depends on TNM staging, but some criteria of its specific content and staging remains controversial. In this paper recent domestic and foreign related researches and clinical trials reports are collected, and the postoperative pathological features affecting esophageal squamous cell carcinoma prognosis were reviewed.",

    "Abstract": "A recombinant protein expression vector pET15b-R9-FOXM1(1-234aa) was constructed and transformed to E. coli in order to generate a strain expressing R9-FOXM1(1-234aa). The recombinant protein R9-FOXM1 (1-234aa) (R9-FOXM1(1-234aa)) was isolated at a large scale through His-tag affinity chromatography. The purity of the purified protein reached 90%. Moreover, MTT assay was used to test the effect of R9-FOXM1(1-234aa) on cells, and the test results showed that R9-FOXM1(1-234aa) caused the cell death of different types of cancer cells with a half lethal dose around 2 mm. The results also demonstrated that R9-FOXM1(1-234aa) suppressed the proliferation of cancer cells and may be considered as a potential angent for anti-cancer in the future. © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Hunan University.

    "Abstract": "RY10-4, an anti-tumor agent, exerts cytotoxicity to various human cancer cell lines. However, few studies reported the effect of combined application of RY10-4 and chemotherapeutic drugs against cancer cells with multidrug resistance (MDR). In this study, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is reported to mediate MDR to anti-cancer drugs, was proved to be overexpressed in the adriamycin (ADR)-resistant human breast cancer cells, namely MCF-7/ADR cells. Furthermore, RY10-4 application resulted in a downregulation of P-gp in MCF-7/ADR cells, thus leading to higher chemosensitivity to ADR. Our study further demonstrated that the MDR phenomenon was under the control of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway, which was suppressed by RY10-4, leading to MDR reversal effects in MCF-7/ADR cells. In vivo, MCF-7/ADR cells were effectively suppressed by the combined ADR/RY10-4 treatment compared with the ADR-alone treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrated that RY10-4 reverses the MDR phenotype in MCF-7/ADR cells by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish a nomogram model to predict the peritoneal metastasis in colon cancer patients without distant metastasis by preoperative imaging examination. METHODS: Clinicopathological data of colon cancer patients without distant metastasis by preoperative imaging examination who underwent surgery in our department between January 2000 and December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Predictors of peritoneal carcinomatosis were analyzed by univariate and Logistic multivariate analyses. Base on the independent predictors by multivariable analysis results, a nomogram model was formulated with further use of R software. The total score was calculated by the addition of each predictor score, indicating the corresponding risk of peritoneal metastasis. The score was greater in the nomogram, and the risk was higher in peritoneal implantation metastasis. A receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve was then constructed to evaluate the predictive abilities of the various preoperative factors and nomogram. RESULTS: A total of 1 417 patients were defined as above and enrolled in the study. The median age was (60.5±13.3) years, 835 cases (58.9%) were male, and 132 cases (9.3%, 132/1417) were diagnosed with synchronous peritoneal carcinomatosis during operation. Univariate analysis showed that peritoneal metastasis was associated with age, incidence of abdominal pain, incidence of mucous bloody stool, CEA level, traversible rate, tumor diameter, ratio of infiltrating type cancer, differentiation, histological type, cT staging and cN staging (all P<0.05). Logistic multivariate analysis revealed that younger age (OR:0.974, 95%CI: 0.958 to 0.990, P=0.001), later clinical T stage (OR: 2.949, 95%CI: 1.588 to 5.476, P=0.001), lesion not traversible(OR: 0.519, 95%CI: 0.314 to 0.858, P=0.011), infiltrative gross type (OR: 1.812, 95%CI: 1.099 to 2.987, P=0.020), larger tumor (OR: 1.044, 95%CI: 0.998 to 1.093, P=0.061), higher preoperative serum CEA level(OR:1.004,95%CI: 1.001 to 1.007, P=0.007) and histopathologic type of mucinous or signet ring cell adenocarcinoma (OR:1.642, 95%CI: 1.009 to 2.673, P=0.046) were independent risk factors. The nomogram model was further established based on above 7 independent risk factors, whose total score was 350 and area under the ROC curve was 0.753(P=0.000). CONCLUSION: The nomogram model can be helpful to screen the colon cancer patients with high risk of peritoneal metastasis and to avoid unnecessary laparotomy for colon cancer patients without distant metastasis by preoperative imaging examination.",

    "Abstract": "Use of anti-inflammatory drugs is well known to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer, one of the most common causes of cancer related mortality. In view of anti-inflammatory property of artesunate reported in various experimental models, the present study was carried out to evaluate its efficacy in rat model where colon carcinogenesis was induced by 1, 2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH). A time course study revealed that two injections of DMH given at an interval of one week resulted in appearance of multiple plaque lesions and aberrant crypt foci in the colon with a peak effect occurring at the end of 8 weeks. An efficacy study carried out with daily oral administration of artesunate (50 and 150 mg/kg) and aspirin (60 mg/kg) showed a marked reduction in pre-neoplastic changes with a significant decrease in the number of aberrant crypt foci, crypt multiplicity and restoration of histoarchitecture. Both the drugs down regulated β-catenin signaling, reduced the levels of angiogenic markers like VEGF, MMP-9 and inhibited cellular proliferation. The anti-cancer effect of these drugs was concomitant with the pro-apoptotic effect as revealed by increased DNA fragmentation, TUNEL positivity and Bax/Bcl2 immunoreactivity. This is the first study to evaluate the inhibitory effect of artesunate on pre-neoplastic changes in colon where its chemopreventive effect was found to be comparable to that of aspirin. Our study strengthens the previous findings and shows that it has a preventive and therapeutic potential in the treatment of colon cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical efficacy of endoscopic therapy for early colorectal cancer. METHODS: Clinical data of 113 early colorectal mucosal carcinoma or submucosal carcinoma receiving endoscopic therapy were retrospectively analyzed and compared with 39 early colorectal cancer cases receiving surgery during the same time. RESULTS: All the cases were well-moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Size of tumors in endoscopic group was (26.2±21.5) mm, and that was (30.9±24.3) mm in surgery group (P=0.257). Baseline data between the two groups were not significantly different (all P>0.05). Significantly shorter median operating time [15.0 minutes vs. 203.0 minutes, χ2=69.322, P=0.000] and median hospital stay [3.0 days vs. 17.0 days, χ2=76.180, P=0.000] were observed in endoscopic group compared with surgery group. The en bloc resection rate, curative resection rate, lymph node metastatic rate and complication rate were not significantly different between two groups (all P>0.05). Ten patients in endoscopic group were referred to additional surgery for deep invasion and/or incomplete resection, of whom 7 received radical surgery, and the other 3 cases without radical surgery did not develop recurrence during follow-up of (20.5±0.9) months. After follow-up for (17.5±15.8) months, the local recurrence rate was 5.3% (6/113) in endoscopic group and 0 (0/39) in surgery group without significant difference (χ2=0.983, P=0.321). There was no significant difference in 5-year tumor-free survival rate between two groups (91.8% vs. 97.0%, χ2=1.533, P=0.216). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic therapy possesses shorter operating time, shorter hospital stay and similar efficacy as compared to surgery in the treatment of early colorectal cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cholangiocarcinoma has poor prognosis and short term-survival. Here, we report the case of a patient with unusually prolonged survival. Case presentation: Our patient was a 56-year-old Arab man with a 6-month history of obstructive jaundice. A computed tomography scan of his abdomen revealed a mass at the confluence of the hepatic ducts with suspected malignant strictures on endoscopy. A positive tissue diagnosis was achieved more than 18 months after commencement of his symptoms. He remained functional throughout this period despite recurrent episodes of cholangitis. Conclusions: Cholangiocarcinoma is a presumably fatal disease, especially because patients tend to present late with unresectable disease. Many patient-related and disease-related factors may alter survival. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Arginine auxotrophy constitutes the Achilles' heel for several tumors, among them glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Hence, arginine-depleting enzymes such as arginine deiminase (ADI) from Streptococcus pyogenes are promising for treatment of primary and maybe even refractory GBM. Based on our previous study in which ADI-susceptibility was shown on a panel of patient-derived GBM cell lines, we here aimed at deciphering underlying molecular mechanisms of ADI-mediated growth inhibition. We found that ADI (35 mU/mL) initially induces a cellular stress-response that is characterized by upregulation of genes primarily belonging to the heat-shock protein family. In addition to autophagocytosis, we show for the first time that senescence constitutes another cellular response mechanism upon ADI-treatment and that this bacterial enzyme is able to act as radiosensitizer (¼ cases). Long-term treatment schedules revealed no resistance development, with treated cells showing morphological signs of cell stress. Next, several combination strategies were employed to optimize ADI-based treatment. Simultaneous and sequential S. pyogenes ADI-based combinations included substances acting at different molecular pathways (curcumin, resveratrol, quinacrine, and sorafenib, 2 × 72 h treatment). Adding drugs to GBM cell lines (n = 4, including a matched pair of primary and recurrent GBM in one case) accelerated and potentiated ADI-mediated cytotoxicity. Autophagy was identified as the main cause of tumor growth inhibition. Of note, residual cells again showed classical signs of senescence in most combinations. Our results suggest an alternative treatment regimen for this fatal cancer type which circumvents many of the traditional barriers. Using the metabolic defect in GBM thus warrants further (pre-) clinical evaluation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most important cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Pirfenidone is an orally available small molecule with therapeutic potential for fibrotic diseases. Material/Methods: In this study, we analyzed the effects of different pirfenidone concentrations on the proliferation of HepG2 HCC cells using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the apoptotic effects of pirfenidone on HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of β-catenin and p-β-catenin. Results: Pirfenidone inhibited proliferation and promoted HepG2 cell apoptosis. In addition, Western blot results indicated that pirfenidone suppressed β-catenin expression in HepG2 cells. To assess the mechanism, we treated HepG2 cells with pirfenidone, and pirfenidone plus the β-catenin activator, SB-216763. The results revealed that SB-216763 accelerated proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in HepG2 cells treated with pirfenidone. Western blot results showed that SB-216763 upregulated β-catenin expression in HepG2 cells treated with pirfenidone. Conclusions: In conclusions, pirfenidone may be a potential drug for HCC treatment. © Med Sci Monit, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effect of the application of \"compound anastomotic device\" on the high-risk colorectal anastomosis in rectal cancer patients undergoing protective ileostomy. METHODS: A total of 116 rectal cancer patients undergoing surgical procedure and prophylactic ileostomy in Tongji Hospital (90 cases) and The Third People's Hospital of Jingdezhen City (26 cases) from May 2011 to October 2016 were prospectively enrolled in the study. Paralleled control study and random digital table were applied. Fifty-eight cases received the compound anastomotic device for protective ileostomy (anastomosis ring group) and 58 cases underwent traditional terminal ileostomy (traditional group). The compound device was mainly composed of Valtrac biodegradable anastomosis ring, drainage tube and condom. Operational procedure was as follows: Ileocecum was freed through incision following laparoscopic total mesorectal excision; Two intestinal ring-shape purses were made; Intestinal wall between purse string was cut and the compound anastomotic device was put into; The purse was tightened and anastomosis ring was closed; The compound device was embed and pull out through the Trocar hole in the right lower abdomen; Then the drainage tube was fixed to the abdominal wall and connected with a drainage bag or an outer pocket. Incidence of anastomotic leak, stoma-related complications, hospital stay and total cost of two groups were compared. RESULTS: The general clinical data between two groups were not significantly different(all P>0.05). Stoma operation was performed successfully in all the patients of two groups. The stoma operation time was (34.6±13.8) min in anastomosis ring group and (25.8±14.0) min in traditional group with significant difference (t=2.123, P=0.035). Postoperative anastomotic leak occurred in 7 cases, including 3 cases with small fistula in traditional group and 4 cases in anastomosis ring group, of whom 1 case underwent left-low abdominal colonic stoma after necrotic intestine resection. All the patients were discharged within postoperative 7 to 37 days. In traditional group, 35 cases (60.3%) occurred stoma-related complications, the total hospitalization expenses was (65±28) thousand yuan, and the average hospital stay (including stoma reversion) was (23.6±11.8) days. In anastomosis ring group, 17 cases (29.3%) occurred stoma-related complications, the total hospitalization expense was (52±11) thousand Yuan, and the average hospital stay was (21.0±16.8) days. The incidence of anastomotic fistula and the hospital stay had no significant difference between two groups (all P>0.05). The stoma-related complication morbidity (χ2=3.216, P=0.002) and the total hospitalization expenses (t=2.683, P=0.027) in anastomosis ring group were significantly lower than those in traditional group. CONCLUSION: Compared with traditional ileostomy, the application of compound anastomotic device for protective ileostomy would be better to benefit the recovery of patients.",

    "Abstract": "We report the fabrication of redox-responsive poly(amino acid) vesicles containing bilayers highly stabilized by disulfide cross-links, β-sheets, and hydrophobic interactions. Tailor-made amphiphilic poly(amino acid)s, specifically poly(2-hydroxyethyl aspartamide)-g-oligo(L-cysteine) (P-g-OC), were used as building blocks for the formation of vesicles. The stable bilayer prematurely released hardly any of an encapsulated anticancer drug, doxorubicin, and the drug release was triggered only by millimolar concentrations of reducing agent, which mimic intracellular conditions. The vesicles demonstrated successful delivery of the drug to the inside of cells, triggered release of the drug after cellular uptake, and translocation of the drug to nuclei in cancer cells. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",

    "Abstract": "Background: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with various human lymphoid and epithelial malignancies such as Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. LMP2A, a virus-encoded latent membrane protein is expressed in a portion of EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) and has been shown to be related with the tumorigenesis and progression of EBVaGC. Aims: To explore the effect of LMP2A silencing on growth of EBVaGC cells in vitro by using a lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit LMP2A gene expression. Methods: A lentivirus vector pGCSIL-LMP2A-shRNA-LV and a negative control vector were constructed and transfected into the EBVaGC cell line GT38. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the inhibitory effect of the lentivirus vector; CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometry were employed to assess the cell growth, cell cycle and apoptosis of GT38 cells. Results: In GT38 cells transfected with LMP2A-shRNA-LV, the expression level of LMP2A mRNA was decreased by 65.4%, and that of LMP2A protein was reduced by 50.8%; the cell proliferation was inhibited, the colony formation ability was suppressed, the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase and apoptotic rate were increased when compared with those transfected with negative control vector or without transfection (P<0.05). Conclusions: Lentivirus-mediated RNAi is effective for silencing LMP2A gene expression, subsequently inhibiting the growth of EBVaGC cells, inducing G0/G1 phase arrest and enhancing cell apoptosis in vitro. LMP2A is supposed to be a potential target for gene therapy of EBVaGC. COPYRIGHT © 2017 by the Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Gastroenterology.",

    "Abstract": "Full-field optical coherence tomography (FFOCT) was used for imaging the interior part of an object. Firstly, the mathematical modeling and performance analysis of the FFOCT system mounted was provided. Secondly, images of several different human tissues were obtained by FFOCT system, including esophagus, uterus, etc. The images of different depths of the same tissue were shown and compared. It was the first time in China that FFOCT was used for generating depth images on human esophagus and uterus; high-resolution images had been obtained for different depths without cutting the tissue sample, in which intercellular substance and myofibril structure could be clearly identified. As the in-depth structure could be imaged without the process needed for frozen and paraffin sectioning methods, the technology could been highly valuable for early cancer diagnosis and pathological analysis in tumor research. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal on Communications.

    "Abstract": "Oral diseases, especially oral cancers, are becoming serious health problems in humans. To image vasculatures and structures simultaneously in the human oral cavity which are tightly associated with various oral diseases, we develop a dual-modality portable optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (ORPAM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. This system utilizes a new rotary scanning mechanism and a compact design of the imaging head, making it portable and free of translation of the imaging interface or samples. Through the phantom experiments, both modalities yield high lateral resolutions of 8.1 μm (ORPAM) and 8.56 μm (OCT), respectively. The axial resolutions are measured to be 116.5 μm for ORPAM and 6.1 μm for OCT. In vivo imaging of a mouse ear was carried out to evaluate the performance of the system in biological tissues. In addition, in vivo oral imaging of a healthy human lip and monitoring recovery progress of a lip ulcer demonstrate the clinical potential of this system. © 2017 Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "There have been unmet needs of developing carrier-free siRNA delivery systems to overcome the undesirable cellular toxicity and immunogenicity of conventional delivery systems such as cationic lipids and polymers. Various nucleic acid nanostructures have been proposed to achieve this goal, however many of them required potent ligands for the intracellular delivery of siRNA. Among various ligands, aptamers received much interest due to their facile preparation process as well as a high binding affinity toward target receptors. In addition, nucleic acid based aptamers can be easily incorporated with various nucleic acid nanostructures through a simple base-pair hybridization. In this study, aptamer incorporated siRNA (Apt-siRNA) was self-assembled with DNA Holliday junction for enhancing targeted delivery of siRNA to the Mucin 1 (MUC1) overexpressing cancer cells. Molecularly self-assembled Holliday DNA junction with Apt-siRNA was analyzed to confirm their cellular uptake and gene silencing as compared to the Apt-siRNA alone in the GFP expressing KB cells. The multivalent Apt-siRNA DNA nanostructure (Holliday-Apt-siRNA) clearly showed their superior potency over the Apt-siRNA alone suggesting their use in carrier-free siRNA delivery systems. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",

    "Abstract": "Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), as an important structural protein of caveolae, has been proven to be correlated with several signal transduction pathways. Recent studies have shown that Cav-1 may play a critical role in response to DNA damage in irradiated pancreatic cancer cells. However, it is not known whether down-regulation of Cav-1 is required to enhance the damage of other kinds of human cells exposed to X-radiation. In this study, the role of Cav-1 in Chang liver cell line (CHL) exposed to X-radiation was investigated. Cav-1 knockdown cell line (CHL-CAV7) was stably established by the siRNA plasmids transfection, and Cav-1 expression was suppressed by 60%, compared with that of control group (CHL-C) which was transfected with non-targeting plasmids. Cellular survival ability and the expressions of proteins related to DNA damage and repair were examined by colony formation assay and Western blot, respectively. Down-regulation of Cav-1 expression induced a significant decrease of the survival rate in CHL-CAV7 cells exposed to 8 and 10 Gy X-radiation. Compared with CHL-C cells, CHL-CAV7 cells showed increased γH2AX expression, as well as decreased p-ATM, DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and p53 protein expressions when treated with X-radiation. Meanwhile, the colocalization of Mdm2 and Cav-1 was decreased in CHL-CAV7 cells compared with that in CHL-C cells. These results suggest that the down-regulation of Cav-1 may aggravate DNA damage of CHL cells through reducing the interaction of Cav-1 and Mdm2, which results in the promotion of p53 degradation.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate three different methods for controlling presacral massive bleeding during pelvic operations. METHODS: Clinical data of 11 patients with presacral massive bleeding during pelvic operation at The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and 157 Branch Hospital of Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command from January 2001 to January 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Hemostasis methods for presacral massive bleeding during operation included gauze packing (whole pressure), drawing pin (local pressure) and absorbable gauze (absorbable gauze was adhered to bleeding position with medical glue after local pressure). Efficacy of these 3 methods for controlling bleeding was evaluated and compared. RESULTS: Ten patients were male and 1 was female with average age of 65.2 (40 to 79) years old. Eight cases were rectal cancer, 2 were presacral malignancies and 1 was rectal benign lesion. Bleeding volume during operation was 300 to 2 500 (median 800) ml. From 2001 to 2012, 4 cases received gauze packing, of whom, 3 cases were scheduled Dixon resection before operation and then had to be referred to Hartman resection; 3 cases died of systemic failure due to postoperative chronic errhysis and infection, and 1 underwent re-operation. At the same time from 2001 to 2012, 5 cases received drawing pin, of whom, bleeding of 3 cases was successfully controlled and Dixon resection was completed. In other 2 cases with hemostasis failure, 1 case underwent re-operation following the use of gauze packing, and another 1 case received absorbable gauze hemostasis. All the 5 patients were healing. From 2013 to 2016, 2 cases completed scheduled anterior resection of rectum after successful hemostasis with absorbable gauze and were healing and discharged. CONCLUSIONS: Gauze packing hemostasis is a basic method for controlling presacral massive bleeding. Drawing pin and absorbable gauze hemostasis are more precise and may avoid the change of surgical procedure. But drawing pin has the possibility of hemostasis failure. Absorbable gauze hemostasis with medical adhesive is effective, simple and fast.",

    "Abstract": "The utmost aim of this present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and proapoptotic potential of Asiatic acid (AA) on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon carcinogenesis in experimental rats. Rats were divided into six groups and received modified pellet diet for 32 weeks. Group 1 served as control rats. Group 2 received AA (4 mg/kg b.w. p.o.). Group 3–6 rats received 15 DMH (20 mg/kg b.w., s.c.) injections once a week starting from the 4th week. Besides DMH, rats received AA (4 mg/kg b.w. p.o.) in group 4 starting 2 weeks before carcinogen treatment till the end of the last DMH; group 5 starting 2 days after last DMH till the end of the experiment; and group 6 throughout the experiment. Pre-neoplastic lesions, xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptotic markers were analysed in our study. Our results ascertained AA supplementation to DMH-exposed rats significantly decreased the incidence of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and phase I xenobiotic enzymes; and increased the phase II xenobiotic enzymes and mucin content as compared to DMH-alone-exposed rats. Moreover the increased expressions of mast cells, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1 observed in the DMH-alone-exposed rats were reverted and were comparable with those of the control rats, when treated with AA. Concordantly AA also induced apoptosis by downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3 and -9 in the DMH-alone-exposed rats. Thus AA was able to inhibit DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis by detoxifying the carcinogen, decreasing the preneoplastic lesions by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Therefore our findings suggest that AA could be used as an effective chemopreventive agent against DMH induced colon carcinogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Antimetastatic activities, low toxicity to normal cells and high selectivity for tumor cells make of the ruthenium complexes promising candidates in the search for develop new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. This study aimed to determine the cytotoxic, genotoxic and to elucidate the signaling pathway involved in the death cell process induced by cis-[RuCl(BzCN)(bipy)(dppb)]PF6 (1) and cis-[RuCl(BzCN)(bipy)(dppe)]PF6 (2) in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) in vitro. Moreover, we report for the first time the anti-angiogenic potential on chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy controls with an age range of 20–30 years and used to calculate the selectivity index (SI). The complex 2 (IC50 = 8.5 ± 0.4/SI = 6.3) showed high cytotoxic and selectivity index against EAC cells than complex 1 (IC50 = 14.9 ± 0.2/SI = 0.2) using the MTT assay. Complex 2 induced DNA damage on Ehrlich tumor cells at concentrations and time periods evalueted. In consequence, it was observed an increase of Tp53 gene expression, G0/G1-arrest cells, and increased levels of cleaved PARP protein. Beside that, the treatment of EAC with complex 2 led to an increase in Annexin V-positive cells and apoptosis induction by Caspase-7. Additionally, the complex 2 inhibited the angiogenesis caused by Ehrlich tumor cells in CAM model. This complex is active and selective for Ehrlich tumor cells, inducing DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and cell death by caspase-dependent apoptosis involving PARP activation (PARP1), and Tp53 induction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Long non-coding RNA PCAT7 has been revealed to participate in tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, the mechanism of PCAT7 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been identified. Hence, this study aimed to determine the function of PCAT7 in NSCLC. Material/Methods: The expression level of PCAT7 in 96 pairs of NSCLC tissues and 6 cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. Proliferation assay, flow cytometric analysis, transwell/migration assay, and Western blotting assay were performed to detect the relation between PCAT7 and malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells in vitro, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Rescue assays were carried out to confirm the contribution of PCAT7 to the progression of NSCLC cells by targeting miR-134-5p. Results: PCAT7 was found to be overexpressed in NSCLC tissues (compared with corresponding non-tumor tissues) and NSCLC cells (compared with normal cell line 16-HBE). Overexpression of PCAT7 resulted in the promotion of tumor cell proliferation, inhibition of cells apoptosis, facilitation of cells metastasis, and formation of EMT phenotype, while PCAT7 expression deletion remarkably prohibited cell proliferation, accelerated their apoptosis, weakened metastasis, and reversed EMT to MET. miR-134-5P, as a target gene of PCAT7, restored the effects of down-regulation of PCAT7. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that PCAT7 participates in tumor progression in NSCLC by inhibiting miR-134-5p. © Med Sci Monit, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Immunological strategies to treat pancreatic cancer offer new therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes. Understanding alterations in the immune systems of pancreatic cancer patients will likely lead to advances in immunotherapy for the disease. We profiled peripheral blood leukocytes from pancreatic cancer patients (n D 22) and age-matched controls (n D 20) using flow cytometry. Immune profiling of pancreatic cancer patients identified phenotypic changes in various immune cell populations, including a population of immunosuppressive monocytes (CD14 + HLA-DR lo/neg ), which were shown to be increased in these patients. There was a correlation between the levels of CD14 + monocytes and the levels of CD14 + HLA-DR lo/neg monocytes in peripheral blood from pancreatic cancer patients. HLA-DR downregulation of monocytes was shown to occur through pancreatic cancer-derived exosome interactions with monocytes. In an in vitro model, exosomes from patient-derived xenograft cell lines and patient plasma decreased HLA-DR expression on CD14 + monocytes. Additionally, tumor-derived exosomes caused immune suppression in monocytes through altered STAT3 signaling, induction of arginase expression, and reactive oxygen species. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms that govern immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer. Understanding monocyte-exosome interactions could lead to novel immunotherapies for this disease. © 2017 Mayo Clinic.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 通过启东地区的肝癌筛查实践，探讨在肝癌高发区开展高风险人群肝癌筛检的筛查效果。 方法： 根据中国癌症基金会癌症早诊早治专家委员会制订的方案，对启东地区筛查发现的乙肝表面抗原(HBsAg)阳性者，采用甲胎蛋白(AFP)联合超声检测的方法开展每年2次的诊断性筛查，评估筛查效果的指标为任务完成率、肝癌检出率、早诊率和治疗率。对筛查患者开展随访，随访截至2016年3月31日。采用寿命表法计算观察生存率，并比较反复筛查组和自动就诊组患者的生存率。 结果： 2007年以来，启东地区筛查目标人群38 016人，发现HBsAg阳性者3 703人，阳性率为9.74%。排除初筛时发现的29例肝癌患者，实际随访队列人数为3 674人，共完成诊断性筛查33 199人次，发现肝癌268例，肝癌检出率为1.61%。其中通过反复筛检发现的肝癌186例，检出率为1.12%；早期病例149例，肝癌早诊率为80.11%；186例肝癌患者中，接受治疗167例，治疗率为89.78%。按HBsAg阳性者队列共随访25 452.00人年计，肝癌年均发生率为1 052.96/10万，其中男性和女性分别发生肝癌187和81例，发生率分别为1 488.45/10万和628.46/10万。队列中所有肝癌患者的1、3、5、8年生存率分别为64.55%、40.50%、32.54%和19.65%。反复筛查组患者的1、3、5、8年生存率分别为77.16%、49.04%、38.53%和24.25%；自动就诊组患者的1、3、5、8年生存率分别为36.25%、21.21%、21.21%和0%，两组患者的生存率差异均有统计学意义(均P<0.05)。 结论： 启东肝癌的筛查实践证实，严格按照专家方案，采用AFP联合超声检测的方法，对肝癌高风险人群开展每年2次的筛查，可以提高肝癌的检出率、早诊率，通过积极的治疗，可以提高患者的生存率，提高肝癌筛查的效果。.Objective: To evaluate the patients' survival and effectiveness of the live cancer screening for population at high risk for liver cancer in Qidong. Methods: According to the Expert Scheme proposed the Expert Committee of Early Detection and Early Treatment, China Cancer Foundation, diagnostical screening by using combined methods of alpha-fetoprotein and B ultrasound monitoring were carried out biannually in individuals with positive HBsAg who were screened from Qidong area. The evaluation indices of the effectiveness are task completion rate of screening, detection rate of liver cancer, early diagnosis rate, and treatment rate. The deadline of the follow-up for the surviving outcome was March 31, 2016. The life-table method was used to calculate the observed survival, and to make comparison and significant tests between survival rates in Group A (those found via repeated periodic screening) and Group B (those diagnosed without periodic screening). Results: Since 2007, 38 016 target population have been screened, and 3 703(9.74%) individuals with positive HBsAg were found. Except for 29 patients with liver cancer at the initial screening, 3 674 persons in the cohort were followed up; 268 patients with liver cancer were detected from the 33 199 person-times screening, with an annual detection rate of 1.61%. Of them, 186 patients were found in Group A(1.12%), in which 149 patients were the early cases, with an early detection rate of 80.11%; 167 out of 186(89.78%) patients received treatment after diagnosis. The incidence of liver cancer in this HBsAg (+ ) cohort of 25 452 person-years was 1 052.96 per 100 000 annually, 187 cases in males(1 488.45/100 000)and 81 cases in females(628.46/100 000). The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year survival of all patients with liver cancer were 64.55%, 40.50%, 32.54%, and 19.65%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year survival rates were 77.16%, 49.04%, 38.53%, and 24.25% in Group A, and were 36.25%, 21.21%, 21.21%, and 0% in Group B, respectively, with significant differences between two groups (P<0.05). Conclusion: The findings show that screening of individuals at high-risk of development of liver cancer, with semiannual AFP and B ultrasound, according to the Expert Scheme, is effective not only in increasing detection rate but also in detecting liver cancer at early stage, and in improving patients' survival as well.",

    "Abstract": "Targeting immunomodulatory pathways has ushered a new era in lung cancer therapy. Further progress requires deeper insights into the biology of immune cells in the lung cancer micro-environment. Dendritic cells (DCs) represent a heterogeneous and highly plastic immune cell system with a central role in controlling immune responses. The intratumoral infiltration and activation status of DCs are emerging as clinically relevant parameters in lung cancer. In this study, we used an orthotopic preclinical model of lung cancer to dissect how the lung tumor micro-environment affects tissue-resident DCs and extract novel biologically and clinically relevant information. Lung tumor-infiltrating leukocytes expressing generic DC markers were found to predominantly consist of CD11bC cells that, compare with peritumoral lung DC counterparts, strongly overexpress the T-cell inhibitory molecule PD-L1 and acquire classical surface markers of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Transcriptome analysis of these CD11bC tumor-infiltrating DCs (TIDCs) indicates impaired antitumoral immunogenicity, confirms the skewing toward TAM-related features, and indicates exposure to a hypoxic environment. In parallel, TIDCs display a specific microRNA (miRNA) signature dominated by the prototypical lung cancer oncomir miR-31. In vitro, hypoxia drives intrinsic miR-31 expression in CD11bC DCs. Conditioned medium of miR-31 overexpressing CD11bC DCs induces pro-invasive lung cancer cell shape changes and is enriched with pro-metastatic soluble factors. Finally, analysis of TCGA datasets reveals that the TIDC-associated miRNA signature has a negative prognostic impact in non-small cell lung cancer. Together, these data suggest a novel mechanism through which the lung cancer micro-environment exploits the plasticity of the DC system to support tumoral progression.

In this study, we used an orthotopic preclinical model of lung cancer to dissect how the lung tumor micro-environment affects tissue-resident DCs and extract novel biologically and clinically relevant information.

    "Abstract": "The successful use of immune cell checkpoint inhibitors PD-1 and PD-L1, over the past 5 y has raised the concern of using immunotherapy to treat various cancers. Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) exhibits high infiltration of lymphocytes and high amplification of immune-related genes including PD-L1 as distinguished from Epstein-Barr virus-non-associated gastric cancer (EBVnGC). Here, we presume that this PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may hinder the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy toward EBVaGC. These studies reveal possibility of generating PD-1-disrupted CTL by CRISPR-Cas9 system and demonstrate enhanced immune response of these PD-1-disrupted CTLs to the EBV-LMP2A antigen and superior cytotoxicity to the EBV-positive gastric cancer cell. In addition, when combined with low-dose radiotherapy, these PD-1-disrupted CTLs mediated an impressive antitumor effect in a xenograft mouse model of EBVaGC. Taken together, these studies illustrate PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immune tolerance of EBVaGC and provide a new strategy for targeting immune checkpoints to break the tolerance for the T cell-based adoptive therapy. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy urgently calls for methods to monitor immune responses at the site of the cancer. Since activated T lymphocytes may serve as a hallmark for anticancer responses, we targeted these cells using the radiotracer N-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 ([18F]FB-IL-2) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Thus, we noninvasively monitored the effects of local tumor irradiation and/or immunization on tumor-infiltrating and systemic activated lymphocytes in tumor-bearing mice. A 10- and 27-fold higher [18F]FB-IL-2 uptake was observed in tumors of mice receiving tumor irradiation alone or in combination with immunization, respectively. This increased uptake was extended to several non-target tissues. Administration of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 reduced tracer uptake by 2.8-fold, indicating a CXCR4-dependent infiltration of activated T lymphocytes upon cancer treatment. In conclusion, [18F]FB-IL-2 PET can serve as a clinical biomarker to monitor treatment-induced infiltration of activated T lymphocytes and, on that basis, may guide cancer immunotherapies. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Prophylactic vaccination is typically utilized for the prevention of communicable diseases such as measles and influenza but, with the exception of vaccines to prevent cervical cancer, is not widely used as a means of preventing or reducing the incidence of cancer. Here, we utilize a peptide-based immunotherapeutic approach targeting ERBB3, a pseudo-kinase member of the EGFR/ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, as a means of preventing occurrence of colon polyps. Administration of the peptide resulted in a significant decrease in the development of intestinal polyps in C57BL/6J-ApcMin mice, a model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In addition, even though they were not vaccinated, ApcMin offspring born to vaccinated females developed significantly fewer polyps than offspring born to control females. Lastly, to validate ERBB as a valid target for vaccination, we found no overt toxicity, increases in apoptosis, or morphological changes in tissues where Erbb3 was ablated in adult mice. These results indicate that prophylactic vaccination targeting ERBB3 could prevent the development of colon polyps in an at-risk patient population. © David J. Bautz, Ang T. Sherpa, and David W.

    "Abstract": "乳腺癌新辅助化疗的初衷是将局部晚期乳腺癌通过化疗缩小肿瘤，来提高手术的根治程度(安全性)，期望改善患者的生存并提高患者的生活质量。另一方面，新辅助化疗是在有可观察的原发肿瘤的基础上给予治疗，能及时评估肿瘤对化疗药物的敏感性，从而为后续治疗提供参考。然而，当今对乳腺癌的治疗理念要求全程管理，这就要求临床医师依据患者的临床、病理、分子生物学信息等制订出总体的治疗策略，并根据新辅助化疗不同的疗效适时合理地调整随后的治疗，这是开展新辅助化疗后所带来的新的问题。.The intention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer is to shrink the tumors in locally advanced disease and to improve the degree of cure of operation (security). Therefore, it is expected to improve quality of life and survival for patients. Additionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered based on the observable primary tumor. Thus, the timely assessment of tumor response to chemotherapeutic drugs provides a basis for subsequent treatment. Currently, however, the treatment concept of breast cancer requires whole process management. It requires clinicians to develop the overall treatment strategy according to tumor biological information of patients, as well as timely and reasonable adjustment of the subsequent treatment based on the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These are new problems arising from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) promotes key characteristics of immunogenic cell death (ICD), in thus far resembling immunogenic chemotherapy and ionizing irradiation. Here, we demonstrate that cancer cells succumbing to HHP induce CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-dependent protective immunity in vivo. Moreover, we show that cell death induction by HHP relies on the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing rapid establishment of the integrated stress response, eIF2α phosphorylation by PERK, and sequential caspase-2, –8 and –3 activation. Non-phosphorylatable eIF2α, depletion of PERK, caspase-2 or –8 compromised calreticulin exposure by cancer cells succumbing to HHP but could not inhibit death. Interestingly, the phagocytosis of HHP-treated malignant cells by dendritic cells was suppressed by the knockdown of caspase-2 in the former. Thus, caspase-2 mediates a key function in the interaction between dying cancer cells and antigen presenting cells. Our results indicate that the ROS→PERK→eIF2α→caspase-2 signaling pathway is central for the perception of HHP-driven cell death as immunogenic. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Cutaneous angiosarcoma (CAS) is a malignant sarcoma with poor prognosis. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression reflects antitumor immunity, and is associated with patient prognosis in various cancers. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between PD-1/PD-L1 expression and CAS prognosis. CAS cases (n D 106) were immunohistochemically studied for PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, and the correlation with patient prognosis was analyzed. PD-L1 expression was assessed by flow cytometry on three CAS cell lines with or without IFNg stimulation. A total of 30.2% of patients’ samples were positive for PD-L1, and 17.9% showed a high infiltration of PD-1-positive cells. Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between a high infiltration of PD-1-positive cells with tumor site PD-L1 expression and favorable survival in stage 1 patients (p D 0.014, log-rank test). Multivariable Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis also showed that patients with a high infiltration of PD-1-positive cells with tumor site PD-L1 expression were more likely to have favorable survival, after adjustment with possible confounders (hazard ratio (HR) D 0.38, p D 0.021, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16–0.86). Immunofluorescence staining of CAS samples revealed that PD-L1-positive cells were adjacent to PD-1-positive cells and/or tumor stroma with high IFNγ expression. In vitro stimulation with IFNγ increased PD-L1 expression in two out of three established CAS cell lines. Our results suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 expression is related to CAS progression, and the treatment with anti- PD-1 antibodies could be a new therapeutic option for CAS. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy is a special type of tumor thromboembolism. We report the case of a patient who developed pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy with alveolar hemorrhage. Almost all patients with pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy die within 1 week of the onset of dyspnea; however, the prognosis in this case was better, with 10 weeks of survival from presentation. Case presentation: A 62-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with a 4-week history of dyspnea on exertion and severe pulmonary hypertension. Five years previously, he had undergone distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. He was afebrile, normotensive, and hypoxemic. A physical examination was unremarkable except for purpura on his upper extremities and trunk. Blood tests showed anemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with emphysema in his upper lungs, moderate pleural effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and enlargement of the right ventricle and main pulmonary artery. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Lung perfusion scintigraphy showed multiple segmental defects. Although recurrence of gastric cancer was confirmed from the results of bone marrow biopsy, bronchoscopy was not performed due to bleeding diathesis. He was treated with corticosteroids, antibiotics, and platelet transfusion, following which resolution of the abnormal lung shadows and right ventricular pressure overload along with partial alleviation of respiratory failure was observed. Because of his poor performance status, he was eventually transited to palliative care and died 6 weeks after admission. Necropsy of the lung confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy with alveolar hemorrhage. Conclusions: Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with cancer who present with severe pulmonary hypertension. In pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy, local inflammation in pulmonary microvasculature may contribute to pulmonary hypertension, and regulation of inflammation using corticosteroids may help improve the prognosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "目的： 研究不同医师和同一医师之间直肠癌体素内不相干运动参数测量的可重复性。 方法： 回顾性分析34例直肠腺癌患者的临床资料，所有患者均在磁共振扫描仪上行直肠MRI常规序列、双指数体素内不相干运动模型(IVIM)和动态对比增强(DCE)-MRI序列扫描。由1位从事消化道肿瘤影像诊断专业15年的医师，在b值为1 000的IVIM序列图像上选定用于测量的肿瘤最大层面。由2位医师(医师1和医师2，分别从事消化道肿瘤影像诊断专业2年及10年)分别在选定的图像上手动勾画感兴趣区，软件自动生成单指数的表观扩散系数(ADC)图、双指数的IVIM参数图及相关参数。间隔1周后重复测量1次。取每次测量的平均值用于统计学分析。对2位医师之间及同一医师自身前后2次测量数据行Wilcoxon符号秩和检验。利用组内相关系数(ICC)和Bland-Altaman图比较2位医师之间及同一医师自身前后2次测量数据的可重复性。 结果： 医师1第1次测量的ADC、真性扩散系数(D)、假性扩散系数(D(*))和灌注分数(f)值分别为0.997×10(－3)mm(2)/s、0.692×10(－3)mm(2)/s、0.043 mm(2)/s和34.6%，第2次测量的ADC、D、D(*)和f值分别为0.993×10(－3)mm(2)/s、0.691×10(－3)mm(2)/s、0.038 mm(2)/s和32.8%。医师2第1次测量的ADC、D、D(*)和f值分别为0.987×10(－3)mm(2)/s、0.651×10(－3)mm(2)/s、0.046 mm(2)/s和32.8%，第2次测量的ADC、D、D(*)和f值分别为0.996×10(－3)mm(2)/s、0.689×10(－3)mm(2)/s、0.041 mm(2)/s和32.7%。2位医师之间及同一医师自身前后2次测量数据的差异均无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。2位医师之间及同一医师自身前后2次测量的ADC值、f值均显著相关；同一医师自身前后2次测量的D值显著相关；医师2自身前后2次测量的D(*)值的相关性明显高于医师1。无论是2位医师之间，还是在同一医师自身前后2次测量的ADC值和f值的95%一致性界限(LoA)均低于D值和D(*)值，其中ADC值最小，D(*)值波动较大；同一医师自身前后2次的f值、D值的95% LoA均较好，f值略小于D值；医师2自身前后2次测量的ADC、D、f和D(*)值的95% LoA均低于医师1。 结论： 在直肠癌IVIM定量参数测量的可重复性研究中，ADC值、f值的可重复性最好，D(*)值相对较差；测量者经验的增加可以提高IVIM参数测量的可重复性。.Objective: To study the measurement reproducibility of parameters derived from introvoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-MRI of rectal cancer between- and within- radiologists. Methods: Clinical data of 34 patients with rectal cancer were prospective analyzed. Conventional MRI sequences, IVIM DWI-MRI with sixteen b values and dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE)-MRI sequences of rectum were acquired by GE 3.0-T MRI imager. The IVIM sequence images with b value=1000 sec/mm(2) were selected to measure the maximum axial section of tumor by a radiologist with 15 year-experiences in gastrointestinal cancer imaging.Two radiologists (radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 with 2 and 10 years of experience in gastrointestinal cancer imaging, respectively) independently draw a freehand region of interest (ROI) that contained the largest available tumor area on the selected section. Monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and biexponential IVIM metrics maps and IVIM parameters were generated automatically by the software. The repeated measurement was performed at an interval of one week. The average values of each measurement were used for statistical analysis. ADC values and IVIM parameters obtained between- and within- radiologists were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altaman plots were used to analyze the parameter reproducibility of two measurements between- and within- radiologists. Results: The first and second measured ADC (×10(-3)mm(2)/s), true diffusivity (D, ×10(-3)mm(2)/s), false diffusivity (D(*,) mm(2)/s) and perfusion fraction (f, %) by radiologist 1 were 0.997, 0.692, 0.043, 34.6 and 0.993, 0.691, 0.038, 32.8, respectively. The first and second measured ADC (×10(-3)mm(2)/s), D (×10(-3)mm(2)/s), D(*) (mm(2)/s), f (%) by radiologist 2 were 0.987, 0.651, 0.046, 32.8 and 0.996, 0.689、0.041, 32.7, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed in ADC and IVIM parameters obtained between- and within- radiologists (P>0.05). The ADC values and the f values of two times were significantly correlated between- and within- radiologists. The D values were significantly correlated within a radiologist, and the correlation of D(*) values within a radiologist was significantly higher than that between radiologists. The 95% limits of agreement (LoA) of ADC values and f values were smaller than those of D values and D(*) values between- and within- radiologists. The 95% LoA of ADC values was the least, while that of D(*) values varied most.The 95% LoA of f values and D values kept steady within a radiologist, and 95% LoA of f values was slightly smaller than that of D values. The 95% LoA of IVIM parameters (ADC, D, f, D(*) values) within radiologists 2 were better than those within radiologist 1. Conclusions: The reproducibilities of ADC and f values are the best, while the reproducibility of D(*) values is relatively poorer in rectal cancer. Measurement reproducibility of parameters derived from IVIM may be improved by increasing radiologists' experiences in drawing ROI.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 探讨胃瘫外敷方治疗消化系统肿瘤患者术后胃瘫(寒证)患者的疗效。 方法： 采用多中心、随机、双盲、安慰剂平行对照临床试验，以优效性设计，收集北京4家三级甲等医院确诊的消化系统肿瘤术后胃瘫、且腹部症状中医局部辨证为寒证的患者入组。区组随机化将患者按1∶1比例分组，在常规治疗(营养支持、胃肠减压、促胃动力药)的基础上，治疗组和对照组患者分别给予胃瘫外敷方或安慰剂穴位(中脘、神阙穴)贴敷，治疗14 d或达到有效标准。 结果： 2013年7月15日至2015年6月3日，共招募患者128例，最终120例患者入组进入全分析集(FAS)，其中治疗组60例，对照组60例。88例患者进入符合方案数据分析集(PPS)，其中治疗组45例，对照组43例。FAS中治疗组患者的临床有效率为68.3%，明显优于对照组(41.7%，P＝0.003)。治疗组达到治疗有效所需的中位时间为8 d，明显短于对照组(10 d，P＝0.017)。FAS中治疗组有3例患者出现不良事件，发生率为5.0%(3/60)，分别为轻中度脱皮、瘙痒、恶心，停药后自行缓解；对照组患者未出现不良反应，两组差异无统计学意义(P＝0.244)。 结论： 胃瘫外敷方是消化系统肿瘤术后胃瘫(寒证)患者的一种新的治疗选择。 临床试验注册： 英国国际标准随机对照试验号注册库，ISRCTN18291857.Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Weitan Waifu patch on the postsurgical gastroparesis syndrome (PGS) of gastrointestinal cancer. Methods: The multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted with superiority design. Patients with PGS of gastrointestinal cancer diagnosed in 4 AAA hospitals and the abdominal symptom manifested as cold syndrome by Chinese local syndrome differentiation were recruited. These patients were randomly divided into two groups according to 1∶1 proportion. Placebo or Weitan Waifu patch was applied in control group or intervention group, respectively, based on the basic treatments, including nutrition support, gastrointestinal decompression, promoting gastric dynamics medicine.Two acupuncture points (Zhongwan and Shenque) were stuck with placebo in control group or patch in treatment group. The intervention course was 14 days or reached the effective standard. Results: From July 15, 2013 to Jun 3, 2015, 128 participants were recruited and 120 eligible cases were included in the full analysis set (FAS), and 60 cases in each group. 88 cases were included in the per-protocol set (PPS), including 45 cases in the treatment group and 43 cases in the control group. In the FAS, the clinical effective rate in the treatment group was 68.3%, significantly superior than 41.7% of the control group (P=0.003). The medium time of effective therapy in the treatment group was 8 days, significantly shorter than 10 days in the control group (P=0.017). In the FAS, 3 adverse events occurred in the treatment group, including mild to moderate decrustation, pruritus and nausea. The incidence rate of adverse events was 5.0% (3/60) and these symptoms were spontaneously remitted after drug withdrawal. No severe adverse events were observed in the control group. There was no significant difference between these two groups (P=0.244). Conclusion: Weitan Waifu patch is a safely and effectively therapeutic method for patients with PGS (cold syndrome) of gastroenterological cancer.

    "Abstract": "精准治疗是将遗传和基因组的信息作为临床治疗出发点的治疗模式，表皮生长因子受体酪氨酸激酶抑制剂(EGFR－TKIs)精准治疗是肺癌精准治疗的重要组成部分。EGFR突变主要发生于18外显子至21外显子区域，45%左右为19外显子缺失(19del)突变，40%左右为21外显子L858R突变，这些突变被称为敏感突变。除19del、L858R和T790M突变外，其余突变为罕见突变，包括Ins19、Ins20、E709、G719、S768、L861和一些复合突变等。既往一些小样本的回顾性研究和个案报道显示，Ins19、L861、G719X和S768I多表现为敏感突变，而Ins20却常常提示对一代和二代EGFR－TKIs的敏感性差，但一些个别类型对三代EGFR－TKIs显示出较高的敏感性。目前针对Ins20的靶向药物Ap32788已进入临床试验。复合突变患者接受EGFR－TKIs疗效与单一敏感突变患者相似。总体来说，罕见敏感突变患者接受EGFR－TKIs治疗的有效率和无进展生存时间与经典敏感突变患者相似或略低于经典敏感突变患者，但较EGFR野生型患者高；与第一代EGFR－TKIs比较，第二代EGFR－TKIs可能更适用于EGFR罕见敏感突变患者的治疗。.Precise medicine is an emerging clinical therapeutic concept based on genomic and genetic information of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) is an important component of precise therapy for lung cancer patients. EGFR mutations occur mainly in exon 18 to 21, in which exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R point mutation that are known as sensitive mutations account for nearly 45% and 40%, respectively. Except for the above two mutations and T790M point mutation, the rest are rare mutations, including Ins19, Ins20, E709, G719, S768, L861 and some compound mutations. Some previous retrospective studies of small sample size and case reports showed that most of EGFR exon19 (Ins), exon 21 (L861), exon 18 (G719X) and exon20 (S768I) mutations were sensitive to TKIs. And although the exon 20 insertion mutation is usually predicted to the first and second generations of EGFR-TKIs resistance, some specific types are sensitive to the third generation of EGFR-TKIs. Currently, targeted drugs for Ins20 -Ap32788 mutation has entered into clinical trials. Patients with complex mutations have similar efficacy on EGFR-TKIs in comparison with those with single sensitivity mutations. In conclusion, when patients with rare sensitive mutations received EGFR-TKIs therapy, the efficacy and progression-free survival time is similar to or slightly lower than those with classical sensitive mutations, whereas it is higher than those with wild-type EGFR. Compared with the first generation of EGFR-TKIs, second generation EGFR-TKIs may be more suitable for the treatment of lung cancer patients harboring rare sensitive EGFR mutations.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 探讨高龄(>70岁)梨状窝内侧壁癌患者行术前放疗和术后放疗的临床疗效及喉功能保全手术的可行性。 方法： 回顾性分析安徽医科大学第一附属医院耳鼻咽喉头颈外科2001年1月至2010年12月收治的48例>70岁梨状窝内侧壁癌手术治疗患者的临床资料，其中术前放疗＋手术组21例，放疗平均剂量为45 Gy；14例保留喉功能，7例未保留喉功能。手术＋术后放疗组27例，放疗平均剂量为65 Gy；10例保留喉功能，17例未保留喉功能。比较两组患者的保喉率、拔管率、并发症的发生率以及生存率等指标。 结果： 术前放疗＋手术组和手术＋术后放疗组患者的保喉率分别为66.7%(14/21)和37.0%(10/27)，差异有统计学意义(P＝0.042)。术前放疗＋手术组保留喉功能患者的拔管率为64.3%(9/14)，手术＋术后放疗组保留喉功能患者的拔管率为50.0%(5/10)，差异无统计学意义(P＝0.680)。术前放疗＋手术组患者术后并发症的发生率为42.9%(9/21)，手术＋术后放疗组患者术后并发症的发生率为37.0%(10/27)，差异无统计学意义(P＝0.680)。喉功能保留组和未保留组患者并发症的发生率分别为41.7%(10/24)和37.5%(9/24)，差异无统计学意义(P＝0.770)。全组48例患者的3年和5年生存率分别为54.2%和35.4%。术前放疗＋手术组和手术＋术后放疗组患者的5年生存率分别为38.1%和33.3%，差异无统计学意义(P>0.05)。术前放疗＋手术组患者中保留喉功能者与未保留喉功能者的5年生存率分别为35.7%和42.9%，差异无统计学意义(P＝0.860)。手术＋术后放疗组患者中保留喉功能和未保留喉功能者的5年生存率分别为40.0%和29.4%，差异无统计学意义(P＝0.240)。 结论： 部分>70岁高龄梨状窝内侧壁癌患者根据全身情况及肿瘤的侵犯范围，在安全切除肿瘤的前提下选用保留喉功能手术是可行的；对于高龄梨状窝内侧壁癌患者，术前放疗与术后放疗具有相同的疗效，且术前放疗可提高患者保留喉功能的概率。.Objective: To investigate the clinical efficacy of preoperative-, postoperative-radiotherapy and surgery for preserving laryngeal function in patient over 70 years of age with medial wall pyriform sinus cancer. Methods: Clinical data of 48 patients over 70 years of age with medial wall pyriform sinus cancer who received surgical treatment from January 2001 to December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 21 cases were given preoperative radiotherapy and surgery (R+ S). The radiation therapy dose was 45 Gy. And 14 cases' larynx is preserved. In addition, 27 cases were given postoperative radiotherapy and surgery (S+ R). The radiation therapy dose was 65 Gy. And 10 cases had preserved laryngeal function. Survival rates were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Chi-square test was used to compare complications between two groups. Results: The larynx preservation rate in R+ S group [66.7% (14/21)] was significantly higher than that in S+ R group [37.0% (10/27), P<0.05]. The complication rate and decannulation rate in R+ S group were 42.9% (9/21) and 64.3% (9/14), respectively, showing no difference compared with those in S+ R group [37.0% (10/27) and 50.0% (5/10), respectively] (all P>0.05). The complication rates of patients with and without larynx preservation were 41.7% (10/24) and 37.5% (9/24), respectively, showing no difference between two groups (P>0.05). The overall 3-years and 5-years survival rates for all patients were 54.2% (26/48) and 35.4% (17/48), respectively. There was no significant difference in survival rates between R+ S [38.1% (8/21)] group and S+ R group [33.3% (9/27), P>0.05)]. In the R+ S group, the survival rates in patients with and without larynx preservation were 40.0% (4/10) and 29.4% (5/17), respectively, showing no significant difference between two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: It is secure and effective to choose the operation with laryngeal preservation for patient over 70 years of age with medial wall pyriform sinus cancer based on their physical conditions and the tumor extension. The preoperative- and postoperative-radiotherapy have the similar effect. Preoperative radiotherapy and surgery increases the laryngeal preservation rate.",

    "Abstract": "The lungs are ubiquitous receptacles of metastases originating from various bodily tumors. Although osteopontin (SPP1) has been associated with tumor dissemination, the role of its isoforms in lung-directed metastasis is incompletely understood. We employed syngeneic mouse models of spontaneous and induced lung-targeted metastasis in C57BL/6 mice competent and deficient in both Spp1 alleles. Tumorderived osteopontin expression was modulated using either stable anti-Spp1 RNA interference, or forced overexpression of intracellular and secreted Spp1 isoforms. Identified osteopontin’s downstream partners were validated using lung adenocarcinoma cells conditionally lacking the Trp53 gene and Ccr2-deficient mice. We determined that host-derived osteopontin was dispensable for pulmonary colonization by different tumor types. Oppositely, tumor-originated intracellular osteopontin promoted tumor cell survival by preventing tumor-related protein 53-mediated apoptosis, while the secretory osteopontin functioned in a paracrine mode to accelerate lung metastasis by enhancing tumor-derived C–C-motif chemokine ligand 2 signaling to cognate host receptors. As new ways to target osteopontin signaling are becoming available, the cytokine may constitute an important therapeutic target against pulmonary involvement by cancers of other organs. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 应用代谢组学技术研究上皮性卵巢癌多药耐药患者血清代谢指纹谱，筛选卵巢上皮癌多药耐药相关的诊断标志物，并从代谢水平探索卵巢上皮癌多药耐药的发生机制。 方法： 收集卵巢上皮癌铂类耐药患者、铂类敏感患者、卵巢良性囊肿及正常对照者的血清共132例，采用液质联用正离子模式检测4组血清样品的代谢指纹谱，通过主成分分析方法筛选出对分组意义重大的差异代谢物，进一步采用核磁共振技术对其进行鉴定，并分析其与临床特征和预后的关系。 结果： 液质联用共鉴定到25 800个代谢化合物，使用主成分分析对数据降维后，得到6个对分组贡献最大的差异代谢物。核磁共振技术的进一步鉴定显示，相对于正常对照组，Dodemorph在卵巢上皮癌组血清中高表达，C16 Sphinganine则表达下调。相对于卵巢癌铂类敏感组，Calycanthidine在铂类耐药组中表达下调，而1－Monopalmitin、Ricinoleic acid methl ester、Polyoxyethylene (600) mono－ricinoleate/Glycidyl stearate在铂类耐药组中表达上调，四者均与脂肪酸代谢相关，且联合诊断铂类耐药的敏感度为86.50%，特异度为81.80%，受试者工作特征曲线下面积(AUC)为0.93。 结论： 采用液质联用技术能较好地区分卵巢上皮癌铂类耐药患者、铂类敏感患者、卵巢良性囊肿及正常对照者，其中差异物Calycanthidine、1－Monopalmitin、Ricinoleic acid methl ester和Polyoxyethylene (600) mono－ricinoleate/Glycidyl stearate联合诊断卵巢上皮癌铂类耐药具有较高的敏感度和特异度，可作为潜在的诊断标志物。脂肪酸的代谢可能参与卵巢上皮癌铂类耐药的生物过程。.Objective: To explore the alteration of plasma metabolomic profiles, screen the new serum markers of multidrug resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and investigate the mechanism. Methods: The serum of 132 cases with cisplatin-resistant EOC, cisplatin-sensitive EOC, benign ovarian cyst and healthy donors were collected. Differentially plasma metabolic profiles were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The significantly different metabolites of each group were screened by using principal component analysis. Then compounds that played a key role in cisplatin resistance were identified by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The relationships between these compounds and clinical characteristics and prognosis were analyzed. Results: LC-MS/MS identified 25 800 metabolic compounds. According to the descending dimension algorithm by principal component analysis, six compounds which were the biggest contributor to grouping were identified. The identified results of NMR showed that the serum level of C16 Sphinganine was lower while Dodemorph was higher in the EOC than those of the normal control. Compared to the cisplatin sensitive group, cisplatin resistant group exhibited a specific metabolic trait characterized by upregulation of 1-Monopalmitin, Ricinoleic acid methyl ester, Polyoxyethylene (600) mono-ricinoleate/Glycidyl stearate and downregulation of Calycanthidine. The four components were all associated with fatty acid metabolism, and the combinational diagnostic sensitivity of these biomarkers for cisplatin-resistance was 86.50% and the specificity was 81.80%, the area of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.93. Conclusions: The metabolic signatures of normal control, benign ovarian cyst, cisplatin sensitivity and cisplatin resistance can be clearly separated from each other by LC-MS/MS technology.The combinational four biomarkers including Calycanthidine, 1-Monopalmitin, Ricinoleic acid methl ester and Polyoxyethylene (600) mono-ricinoleate/Glycidyl stearate are more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of cisplatin resistant EOC, and may provide the potentially predict markers of chemotherapeutic response in metabolic level. The fatty acid metabolism may participate in the cisplatin resistant progression of EOC.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 探讨中央型肝细胞癌联合术中瘤床放疗的安全性，并观察近期并发症。 方法： 采用前瞻性队列研究方法将开腹切除肿瘤的79例中央型肝细胞癌患者分为研究组(联合术中瘤床放疗，32例)和对照组(单纯手术，47例)。研究组患者手术切除肿瘤后，瘤床行术中电子线放疗，对照组不作术中放疗。比较两组患者的术中出血量、手术时间、术后肝功能和胃肠功能的恢复情况以及手术并发症的发生情况。 结果： 两组患者术后30 d内均无死亡病例。研究组患者的总手术时间为(319±76)min，长于对照组[(233±76)min，P<0.001]。研究组患者术后第1天中位天门冬氨酸氨基转移酶水平为562.5 U/L，高于对照组(347.0 U/L，P＝0.031)。研究组患者术后第3天、第7天平均凝血酶原活动度水平分别为(68.3±17.9)%和(73.4±10.2)%，均明显低于对照组[分别为(78.9±15.9)%和(80.0±10.6)%，均P<0.05]。两组患者的肿瘤大小、分化程度、有无卫星灶、被膜侵犯、微血管侵犯的差异均无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。两组患者的术后住院时间、肠道通气时间以及肝功能不全、大量腹水、胸腔积液、感染、胆瘘的发生率差异无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。两组患者术后第1、3、5、7天丙氨酸氨基转移酶、白蛋白、总胆红素的差异均无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。 结论： 中央型肝细胞癌联合术中瘤床放疗虽然延长了手术时间，延缓了术后肝功能的早期恢复，但仍是安全可行的。 临床试验注册： 中国医学科学院肿瘤研究所肿瘤医院，ChiCTR－TRC－12002802.Objective: To carry out a prospective cohort study of combined intra-operative radiotherapy for centrally located hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and to observe the safety and postoperative complications. Methods: A total of 79 patients with centrally located HCC who underwent hepatectomy were divided into two groups: experimental group (combined with targeted intra-operative radiotherapy, 32 cases) and control group (single surgical operation, 47 cases). Patients in the experimental group received intra-operative electron radiotherapy after tumor resection, while patients in the control group received to intra-operative electron radiotherapy.The haemorrhagia amount and operation time during the operation, intra-operative liver function and the recovery of liver and gastrointestinal tract of patients in these two groups were compared. Results: No postoperative 30-day mortality was observed in all of the patients. The average total operation time of patients in the experimental group was (319±76) min, significantly longer than (233±76) min of the control group (P<0.001). The average aspartate transaminase (AST) level of patients in the experimental group at postoperative day 1 was 562.5 U/L, significantly higher than 347.0 U/L of control group (P=0.031). However, the average prothrombin activity levels of patients in the experimental group at postoperative day 3 and day 7 were (68.3±17.9)% and (73.4±10.2)%, respectively, significantly lower than (78.9±15.9)% and (80.0±10.6)% of control group (both P<0.05). There were no significant differences of tumor volume, differentiation degree, satellite lesion, dorsal membrane invasion, microvascular invasion between these two groups (all P>0.05). There were no significant differences of hospital stay, ventilation time, the incidence of hepatic insufficiency, ascites, pleural effusion, infection, biliary fistula between these two groups (all P>0.05). There were no significant differences of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, total bilirubin between these two groups at postoperative day 1, 3, 5 and 7 (all of P>0.05). Conclusion: The resection of centrally located HCC combined with intra-operative radiotherapy may increase the total operation time, delay the early postoperative recovery of liver function, but it is still safe and feasible.

    "Abstract": "Background The intensive polychemotherapy regimen eBEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone in escalated doses) is very active in patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma, albeit at the expense of severe toxicities. Individual patients might be cured with less burdensome therapy. We investigated whether metabolic response determined by PET after two cycles of standard regimen eBEACOPP (PET-2) would allow adaption of treatment intensity, increasing it for PET-2-positive patients and reducing it for PET-2-negative patients. Methods In this open-label, randomised, parallel-group phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18–60 years with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in 301 hospitals and private practices in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. After central review of PET-2, patients were assigned (1:1) to one of two parallel treatment groups on the basis of their PET-2 result. Patients with positive PET-2 were randomised to receive six additional cycles of either standard eBEACOPP (8 × eBEACOPP in total) or eBEACOPP with rituximab (8 × R-eBEACOPP). Those with negative PET-2 were randomised between standard treatment with six additional cycles of eBEACOPP (8 × eBEACOPP) or experimental treatment with two additional cycles (4 × eBEACOPP). A protocol amendment in June, 2011, introduced a reduction of standard therapy to 6 × eBEACOPP; after this point, patients with positive PET-2 were no longer randomised and were all assigned to receive 6 × eBEACOPP and patients with negative PET-2 were randomly assigned to 6 × eBEACOPP (standard) or 4 × eBEACOPP (experimental). Randomisation was done centrally using the minimisation method including a random component, stratified according to centre, age (&lt;45 vs ≥45 years), stage (IIB, IIIA vs IIIB, IV), international prognostic score (0–2 vs 3–7), and sex. eBEACOPP was given as previously described; rituximab was given intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m2 (maximum total dose 700 mg). The primary objectives were to show superiority of the experimental treatment in the PET-2-positive cohort, and to show non-inferiority of the experimental treatment in the PET-2-negative cohort in terms of the primary endpoint, progression-free survival. We defined non-inferiority as an absolute difference of 6% in the 5-year progression-free survival estimates. Primary analyses in the PET-2-negative cohort were per protocol; all other analyses were by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00515554. Findings Between May 14, 2008, and July 18, 2014, we recruited 2101 patients, of whom 137 were found ineligible before randomisation and a further 19 were found ineligible after randomisation. Among 434 randomised patients (217 per arm) with positive PET-2, 5-year progression-free survival was 89·7% (95% CI 85·4–94·0) with eBEACOPP and 88·1% (83·5–92·7) with R-eBEACOPP (log-rank p=0·46). Patients with negative PET-2 randomly assigned to either 8 × eBEACOPP or 6 × eBEACOPP (n=504) or 4 × eBEACOPP (n=501) had 5-year progression-free survival of 90·8% (95% CI 87·9–93·7) and 92·2% (89·4–95·0), respectively (difference 1·4%, 95% CI −2·7 to 5·4). 4 × eBEACOPP was associated with fewer severe infections (40 [8%] of 498 vs 75 [15%] of 502) and organ toxicities (38 [8%] of 498 vs 91 [18%] of 502) than were 8 × eBEACOPP or 6 × eBEACOPP in PET-2-negative patients. Ten treatment-related deaths occurred: four in the PET-2-positive cohort (one [&lt;1%] in the 8 × eBEACOPP group, three [1%] in the 8 × R-eBEACOPP group) and six in the PET-2-negative group (six [1%] in the 8 × eBEACOPP or 6 × eBEACOPP group). Interpretation The favourable outcome of patients treated with eBEACOPP could not be improved by adding rituximab after positive PET-2. PET-2 negativity allows reduction to only four cycles of eBEACOPP without loss of tumour control. PET-2-guided eBEACOPP provides outstanding efficacy for all patients and increases overall survival by reducing treatment-related risks for patients with negative PET-2. We recommend this PET-2-guided treatment strategy for patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.

    "Funding Text 2": "Two major findings have emerged from the GHSG HD18 trial for patients with newly diagnosed advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. First, a negative PET scan after initial therapy with two cycles of eBEACOPP allows a reduction of treatment cycles from eight to four without a negative effect on progression-free survival. The reduction is associated with markedly improved tolerability and thereby a significantly improved overall survival. Second, a positive PET scan after two cycles of eBEACOPP does not imply the need for intensification of chemotherapy, as reflected by the excellent progression-free survival of patients with positive PET-2 regardless of treatment group. This finding questions the described prognostic effect of PET-2 positivity in the present context. 12,15–17 Our results must be put into perspective with the recently published RATHL study evaluating a PET-2-guided strategy with upfront ABVD. 15 Our trial and RATHL used different inclusion criteria (age 18–60 years vs >18 years), different definitions of advanced-stage disease—ie, RATHL included more patients with less advanced disease than did our study—(282 [14%] patients with Ann Arbor stage II of 1945 patients vs 500 [42%] of 1203), and different interpretation of Deauville score 3 (positive vs negative). However, distribution of the International Prognostic Score in both trials was comparable, implying a certain similarity in the patient cohorts. In patients with negative PET-2, four cycles of eBEACOPP used in HD18 resulted in progression-free survival of 95·3% at 3 years, whereas it was only 84·4% with two cycles of ABVD followed by 4 cycles of ABVD or AVD (ABVD omitting bleomycin) in the RATHL trial. Thus, the negative predictive value of PET seems to be higher after initial treatment with two cycles of eBEACOPP than after two cycles of ABVD. This observation is in accordance with the insufficient negative predictive value of PET-2 in an Italian trial 18 of ABVD-treated patients. Compared with our previous and current standards of eight and six cycles of eBEACOPP, respectively, the excellent outcome for patients with negative PET-2 could now be achieved with a significantly decreased incidence of severe adverse events. Particularly, severe infections were observed less frequently with four cycles of eBEACOPP—occurring in the same range as that reported with PET-2-guided ABVD or AVD. 15 In our trial, only two (<1%) of 501 patients developed second acute myeloid leukaemia, and we did not observe a single case of treatment-related mortality in patients randomly assigned to treatment with four cycles. Regarding potentially life-threatening adverse events, we found no disadvantage of four cycles of eBEACOPP over PET-2-guided ABVD in this indirect comparison. Of note, the superior progression-free survival in HD18 could be achieved within a much shorter treatment duration of only 12 weeks compared with 24 weeks with six cycles of ABVD or AVD in the RATHL trial. However, eBEACOPP remains an intensive treatment, inducing neutropenic fever in about 20% and the need for platelet transfusions in about 25% of all patients. Thus, although the reduced-intensity treatment is safe, it still needs specialised care and relevant resources from the medical infrastructure. The outcome differences between ABVD or eBEACOPP applied upfront are even more pronounced in the PET-2-positive cohort. In the RATHL trial, treatment was escalated from ABVD to BEACOPP after a positive PET-2 and 3-year progression-free survival reached 67·5%. 15 This result is clearly inferior to the 3-year progression-free survival of 88% observed with six cycles of eBEACOPP among patients with Deauville score 4 in our trial. Because patients in both studies received eBEACOPP from the third cycle onwards, the observed difference could most likely be explained by the initial treatment with two cycles of either ABVD or eBEACOPP. Therefore, patients with insufficient response to ABVD seem to be unable to reach adequate outcomes with subsequent eBEACOPP therapy. In accordance with this observation, even escalation to high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support was not able to improve the outcome over standard ABVD for patients with positive PET-2 after initial treatment with ABVD. 2,16 Thus, initiation of therapy with two cycles of eBEACOPP appears to be mandatory to achieve optimal progression-free survival in advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. After we completed enrolment of patients with positive PET-2 into the randomised part of the HD18 study, the standard of care was changed from eight to six cycles based on the results of our HD15 trial. 1 Subsequently, enrolled patients with positive PET-2 were treated with six cycles of eBEACOPP, resulting in similarly high tumour control but a more favourable safety profile compared with those treated with eight cycles. We can thus safely recommend using only six cycles of eBEACOPP for patients with positive PET-2. Because factors that determine early response to therapy as measured by PET-2 are still unknown at baseline, the outcome of the overall treatment strategy should be discussed when informing patients about the different treatments. With PET-2-guided ABVD, 3-year progression-free survival is 83·7% among patients aged less than 60 years, and 79% for those with Ann Arbor stage III or IV disease. 15 In HD18, the corresponding numbers are 92·3% and 92·2%. This obvious advantage in progression-free survival when using eBEACOPP upfront is particularly relevant, not only because avoiding relapse and the subsequent necessity of further toxic treatments is the most important endpoint from the patients' perspective, but also because progression-free survival differences translate into overall survival differences over time in advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. 19–21 Even with the reduced intensity for patients with negative PET-2, the burden of treatment remains relevant. New drugs with promising single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma might further improve the risk–benefit ratio in the treatment of advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. 22,23 We have modified the eBEACOPP regimen with the anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin, resulting in a new regimen which was well tolerated in phase 2 and is being tested against standard eBEACOPP in a phase 3 trial ( NCT02661503 ). 24 Another approach aims to improve the moderate efficacy of the ABVD regimen by adding brentuximab vedotin ( NCT01712490 ). 25 A further step forwards would be if the survival outcomes reported in our trial can be reached by any of these new regimens with even less toxicity for patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. The following weaknesses of our analysis should be acknowledged. First, the definition of PET negativity was conservative and the PET-2-negative cohort was therefore relatively small, including only 1005 (52%) of all randomised patients. 10 years ago, when the HD18 study was planned, the GHSG deemed it unethical to put patients at risk for treatment failure with a less conservative approach. Today, a Deauville score of 3 is generally accepted as negative in advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma, and, considering the excellent outcome of this subgroup when treated with six cycles, one could speculate that more patients could have received only four cycles of eBEACOPP without compromising the overall outcome. Regarding the study in PET-2-negative patients, conclusions are affected by the change of standard treatment from eight to six cycles in the middle of the recruitment period, lessening the anticipated effect of the treatment de-escalation in the experimental arm. Although not yet finally conclusive owing to short follow-up, the experimental treatment compared favourably also with the updated standard, as reflected by similar progression-free survival and overall survival as well as markedly reduced toxicity. Thus, the study results remain important also when 6 × eBEACOPP is regarded as the standard to be challenged. Third, we could not yet evaluate all potential late effects. Among these events, infertility is of high relevance for patients with a wish for parenthood. 6,26 Additional studies are underway to describe gonadal dysfunction in detail, and we recommend cooperation with centres for reproduction medicine and cryopreservation of sperm or oocytes before start of treatment. With respect to patient-reported outcomes, especially severe and persisting cancer-related fatigue is a relevant problem for about 25% of Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors and has a substantial effect on their social reintegration. 27 However, as treatment intensity is not correlated to the persistence of severe cancer-related fatigue in Hodgkin's lymphoma, we do not expect to see major differences between treatment groups in the present trial. 7 Because we cannot estimate the representativeness of our study cohort from available data, we must acknowledge that patients at increased risk for severe side-effects might be underrepresented in our trial. 28 However, the median age in our trial cohort is very similar to registry data, indicating no major recruitment bias. Our results thus apply to most patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma. Finally, the results of our HD18 study are only applicable if the local infrastructure provides sufficient resources to safely administer intensive chemotherapy. These resources include costly prophylactic medications, blood products, and emergency in-patient care, as well as a dedicated and experienced medical and nursing staff. Strengths of our study include the robust study design and the large patient number, both of which allow firm conclusions on the observed effects. Because most participating centres were private practices or primary care hospitals, the results reflect a real-world setting in high-income countries. We conclude that PET-2-guided therapy with eBEACOPP combines outstanding efficacy with an acceptable safety profile for both PET-2-negative and PET-2-positive patients. PET-2-guided de-escalation has substantially reduced the treatment-related risks and at the same time improved the overall survival for early-responding patients. Survival outcomes in HD18 are clearly superior compared with any other controlled trial reported so far. We therefore strongly recommend this PET-2-guided treatment strategy for patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Acknowledgments Participation in this non-inferiority trial implicated potential loss of efficacy for patients with a negative PET-2 randomised to receive only four cycles of eBEACOPP. We thank all participating patients, their families, and their treating physicians that they accepted this potentially increased risk of treatment failure and thereby helped to improve the treatment for future patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma. We thank all participating GHSG HD18 centres as listed in the appendix for their continuous support. We thank Oluwatoyin Shonukan (Boston University School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA) for her helpful comments and critical review of the manuscript.

    "Abstract": "To address the current dearth of clinically relevant publications regarding ovariohysterectomy (OVH) in the domestic pot-bellied pig (PBP), the present study aims to report prevalence of uterine lesions, intraoperative complications, and short and long-term survival in this species (n=298). Prevalence of lesions included uterine neoplasia 11.4 per cent (34/298), pyometra 1.6 per cent (5/298) and cystic endometrial hyperplasia 5 per cent (15/298). Pigs at least six years of age were statistically more likely to have a uterine lesion (less than P=0.001). Smooth muscle tumours represented the most frequent neoplasm. Haemorrhage was the most common intraoperative complication in 23 per cent (8/34) of pigs with neoplasia. Pigs without reproductive tract lesions were statistically more likely to survive to hospital discharge than those with lesions (P=0.001). Short-term survival, defined as survival to hospital discharge, of pigs with reproductive tract lesions was 89 per cent (48/54). Pigs with pyometra were least likely to survive to discharge 60 per cent (3/5). Long-term survival (≥1 year) was 93 per cent (14/15) for pigs with neoplasia. Practitioners should be aware of significantly higher rate of neoplastic and inflammatory diseases in PBP at least six years of age. To minimise morbidity and mortality in PBP undergoing OVH, the present study suggests the procedure should be performed prior to six years of age. © British Veterinary Association (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

    "Abstract": "目的： 探讨配对盒基因2(Pax2)和细胞周期蛋白D1 (cyclin D1)在晚期卵巢浆液性腺癌中的表达及临床意义。 方法： 2003年1月至2013年12月间行初治卵巢癌肿瘤细胞减灭术的晚期(Ⅲ～Ⅳ期)卵巢浆液性腺癌患者202例，应用组织芯片和免疫组化法检测肿瘤组织中Pax2和cyclin D1蛋白的表达，分析其与患者临床病理特征及预后的关系。 结果： 202例卵巢浆液性腺癌患者中，Pax2蛋白的阳性率为24.8%(50/202)，cyclin D1蛋白的阳性率为25.2%(51/202)。Pax2和cyclin D1在不同年龄、临床分期和病理分级的卵巢浆液性腺癌患者中的表达水平差异均无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。Pax2阴性患者的中位生存时间为53个月，中位无进展生存时间为29个月。Pax2阳性患者的中位生存时间为66个月，中位无进展生存时间为33个月。Pax2阴性和阳性患者的中位生存时间差异有统计学意义 (χ(2)＝4.06，P＝0.04)，Pax2阴性和阳性患者的中位无进展生存时间差异无统计学意义(χ(2)＝2.43，P＝0.11)。cyclin D1阴性患者的中位生存时间为62个月，中位无进展生存时间为30个月。cyclin D1阳性患者的中位生存时间为48个月，中位无进展生存时间为22个月。cyclin D1阴性和阳性患者的中位生存时间差异有统计学意义 (χ(2)＝4.71，P＝0.03)，cyclin D1阴性和阳性患者的中位无进展生存时间差异无统计学意义(χ(2)＝0.59，P＝0.41)。多因素分析显示，Pax2表达为影响卵巢浆液性腺癌患者预后的独立因素(RR为0.597，95%CI为0.371～0.962, P<0.034)。 结论： Pax2和cyclin D1表达与晚期卵巢浆液性腺癌患者的预后有关，Pax2为影响晚期卵巢浆液性腺癌患者预后的独立因素。.Objective: To investigate the expressions and clinical significances of paired box gene 2 (Pax2) and cyclin D1 protein in advanced ovarian serous carcinoma. Methods: From January 2003 to December 2013, the pathologic tissues of 202 patients with advanced ovarian serous cancer (Ⅲ-Ⅳ) who underwent initial cytoreductive surgery were collected. The expressions of Pax2 and cyclin D1 protein were detected by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray. The relationships of their expressions with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of the patients were analyzed. Results: The positive rate of Pax2 protein expression of the 202 patients with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma was 24.8% (50/202) and that of cyclin D1 was 25.2% (51/202). The expressions of Pax2 and cyclin D1 were not significantly related with age, clinical stage and pathological grade of ovarian serous adenocarcinoma patients (P>0.05). The median overall survival (OS) time of Pax2-negative patients was 53 months and the progression-free survival (PFS) time was 29 months. The median OS time of Pax2-positive patients was 66 months and PFS time was 33 months, the OS of Pax2-negative patients was significant different from that of Pax2-positive patients (χ(2)=4.06, P=0.04). The median PFS time of Pax2-negative patients was not significant different from that of Pax2-positive patients (χ(2)=2.43, P=0.11). The median OS time of cyclin D1-negative patients was 62 months and PFS time was 30 months. The median OS time of cyclin D1-positive patients was 48 months and PFS time was 22 months. The median OS time of cyclin D1-negative patients was significantly different from that of cyclin D1-positive patients (χ(2)=4.71, P=0.03), while the median PFS time of cyclin D1-negative patients was marginally different from that of cyclin D1-positive patients (χ(2)=0.59, P=0.41). Multivariate analysis showed that the expression of Pax2 was an independent factor of the prognosis for patients with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma (RR=0.597, 95% CI 0.371-0.962, P<0.034). Conclusion: The expressions of Pax2 and cyclin D1 are associated with the prognosis of patients with advanced ovarian serous adenocarcinoma while Pax2 is an independent prognostic factor.",

    "Abstract": "目的： 建立一个基于肝细胞癌(HCC)临床病理特征的术后预后评分系统。 方法： 回顾性分析1999—2010年中国医学科学院肿瘤医院连续收治的接受肝切除术治疗的845例HCC患者的临床资料，选取临床上常用的21个临床指标进行研究，采用受试者工作特征曲线(ROC)确定术前甲胎蛋白(AFP)水平、术前血清碱性磷酸酶(ALP)水平和术中出血量3个临床指标的截断值(cut－off值)，以Kaplan－Meier法和Cox回归模型确定HCC术后预后的独立危险因素。以最小加权法建立HCC术后预后评分系统，并按评分结果将HCC患者分为低危、中危和高危3个风险组，比较3组HCC患者的复发和生存情况。 结果： 单因素分析显示，HCC患者的中位无复发生存时间(RFS)与患者有无症状、术前AFP水平、血清ALP水平、肿瘤直径、是否多发、腹腔淋巴结转移情况、有无大血管侵犯或存在瘤栓、有无肝外侵犯或穿破浆膜、肝硬化程度、术中出血量、切除方式、是否有病理脉管瘤栓、术中是否输血、有无围手术期输血有关(均P<0.05)；HCC患者的中位总生存时间(OS)与患者有无症状、术前AFP水平、血清ALP水平、肿瘤直径、是否多发、腹腔淋巴结转移情况、有无大血管侵犯或存在瘤栓、有无肝外侵犯或穿破浆膜、肝硬化程度、术中出血量、切除方式、是否有病理淋巴细胞浸润、是否有病理脉管瘤栓、术中是否输血、有无围手术期输血有关(均P<0.05)。多因素分析显示，术前AFP≥20 ng/ml、有临床症状、肿瘤直径≥5 cm、肿瘤多发、大血管侵犯或存在瘤栓、肝外侵犯或穿破浆膜、中度及重度肝硬化、非解剖性切除是影响HCC患者术后RFS和OS的独立危险因素(均P<0.05)。术中出血量≥325 ml是影响患者术后RFS的独立危险因素(P<0.05)，腹腔淋巴结转移和病理脉管瘤栓是影响患者术后OS的独立危险因素(均P<0.05)。将11个预后因素按照各自权重建立HCC术后预后评分系统，评分区间为0～26分，其中0～5分为低危组(286例)，6～12分为中危组(503例)，≥13分为高危组(56例)。低危、中危和高危组患者的中位RFS分别为80、27和6个月，差异有统计学意义(P<0.001)；中位OS分别为134、51和15个月，差异有统计学意义(P<0.001)。 结论： 建立的新型的评分系统对HCC术后的长期生存具有有效的预测意义。.Objective: To establish a new scoring system based on the clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to predict prognosis of patients who received hepatectomy. Methods: A total of 845 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy from 1999 to 2010 at Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were retrospectively analyzed. 21 common clinical factors were selected in this analysis. Among these factors, the cut-off values of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and intraoperative blood loss were evaluated by using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the independent risk factors associated with the prognosis of HCC patients after hepatectomy. HCC postoperatively prognostic scoring system was established according to the minimum weighted method of these independent risk factors, and divided the patients into 3 risk groups, including low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk group. The relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared among these groups. Results: The univariate analysis showed that clinical symptoms, preoperative α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, tumor size, tumor number, abdominal lymph node metastasis, macrovascular invasion or tumor thrombus, extrahepatic invasion or serosa perforation, the severity of hepatic cirrhosis, intraoperative blood loss, the liver operative method, pathological tumor thrombus, intraoperative blood transfusion, perioperative blood transfusion were significantly associated with median RFS of these HCC patients (P<0.05). Alternatively, clinical symptoms, preoperative AFP level, serum ALP level, tumor size, tumor number, abdominal lymph node metastasis, macrovascular invasion or tumor thrombus, extrahepatic invasion or serosa perforation, the severity of hepatic cirrhosis, intraoperative blood loss, the liver operative method, pathological lymphocyte invasion, pathological tumor thrombus, intraoperative blood transfusion, perioperative blood transfusion were significantly associated with the median OS of these HCC patients (P<0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that AFP ≥20 ng/ml, clinical symptoms, tumor diameter ≥5 cm, multiple tumors, macrovascular invasion or tumor thrombus, extrahepatic invasion or serosa perforation, moderate and severe liver cirrhosis, non- anatomic resection were the independent risk factors of RFS and OS (P<0.05). The independent risk factor of RFS was intraoperative bleeding loss ≥325 ml (P<0.05); The independent risk factors of OS were abdominal lymph node metastasis and pathological tumors thrombus (P<0.05). The respective weight of 11 independent factors was used to establish the scoring system (scores range from 0 to 26). In the score system, 0 to 5 points were defined as the low-risk group (286 cases), 6 to 12 points were determined as the intermediate-risk group (503 cases), more than 13 points were classified as the high-risk group (56 cases). The median RFS of the low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk group were 80, 27 and 6 months, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). The median OS of the three groups were 134, 51 and 15 months, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). Conclusion: This new score system provides effective prediction of postoperative prognosis for HCC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer subtypes such as triple-negative that lack the expression of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2), remain poorly clinically managed due to a lack of therapeutic targets. This necessitates identification and validation of novel targets. Suppression of Popeye domain-containing protein 1 (POPDC1) is known to promote tumorigenesis and correlate to poor clinical outcomes in various cancers, and also promotes cardiac and skeletal muscle pathologies. It remains to be established whether POPDC1 is dysregulated in breast cancer, and whether overcoming the dysregulation of POPDC1 could present a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit breast tumorigenesis. We assessed the potential of POPDC1 as a novel target for inhibiting breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. POPDC1 was significantly suppressed with reduced cell membrane localization in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, functional suppression of POPDC1 promoted breast cancer cell migration and proliferation, which were inhibited by POPDC1 overexpression. Finally, cAMP interacts with POPDC1 and up-regulates its expression in breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that POPDC1 plays a role in breast tumorigenesis and represents a potential therapeutic target or biomarker in breast cancer medicine. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Monitoring treatment and early detection of fatal breast cancer (BC) remains a major unmet need. Aberrant circulating DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns are likely to provide a highly specific cancer signal. We hypothesized that cell-free DNAme markers could indicate disseminated breast cancer, even in the presence of substantial quantities of background DNA. Methods: We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) of 31 tissues and established serum assays based on ultra-high coverage bisulfite sequencing in two independent prospective serum sets (n = 110). The clinical use of one specific region, EFC#93, was validated in 419 patients (in both pre- and post-adjuvant chemotherapy samples) from SUCCESS (Simultaneous Study of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel Combination adjuvant treatment, as well as Extended Bisphosphonate and Surveillance-Trial) and 925 women (pre-diagnosis) from the UKCTOCS (UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening) population cohort, with overall survival and occurrence of incident breast cancer (which will or will not lead to death), respectively, as primary endpoints. Results: A total of 18 BC specific DNAme patterns were discovered in tissue, of which the top six were further tested in serum. The best candidate, EFC#93, was validated for clinical use. EFC#93 was an independent poor prognostic marker in pre-chemotherapy samples (hazard ratio [HR] for death = 7.689) and superior to circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (HR for death = 5.681). More than 70% of patients with both CTCs and EFC#93 serum DNAme positivity in their pre-chemotherapy samples relapsed within five years. EFC#93-positive disseminated disease in post-chemotherapy samples seems to respond to anti-hormonal treatment. The presence of EFC#93 serum DNAme identified 42.9% and 25% of women who were diagnosed with a fatal BC within 3-6 and 6-12 months of sample donation, respectively, with a specificity of 88%. The sensitivity with respect to detecting fatal BC was ~ 4-fold higher compared to non-fatal BC. Conclusions: Detection of EFC#93 serum DNAme patterns offers a new tool for early diagnosis and management of disseminated breast cancers. Clinical trials are required to assess whether EFC#93-positive women in the absence of radiological detectable breast cancers will benefit from anti-hormonal treatment before the breast lesions become clinically apparent. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: It is estimated that nearly 600,000 cancer cases in the UK could have been avoided in the past five years if people had healthier lifestyles. A number of theories of behaviour change suggest that before people will change health behaviours, they must accept that a risk applies to them. This study aimed to explore the views of the public on receiving personalised cancer risk information and the potential for that information to motivate behaviour change. Methods: We conducted 27 interviews with members of the public (mean age 49 ± 23 years). Each participant completed a questionnaire to allow calculation of their risk of developing the most common cancers (10 for women, 8 for men). During the interviews we presented their risk using a web-based tool developed for the study and discussions covered their views on receiving that information. Each interview was audio-recorded and then analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants generally viewed the concept of personalised cancer risk positively. The first reaction of almost all when presented with their 10-year risk of an individual cancer without any further context was that it was low and not concerning. Views on what constituted a high risk ranged widely, from 0.5 to 60%. All felt seeing the impact of changes in lifestyle was helpful. For some this led to intentions to change behaviour, but reductions in risk were not always motivating as the risks were considered low and differences small. Conclusions: Provision of personalised cancer risk was well received and may be a useful addition to other cancer prevention initiatives. Further work is needed in particular to develop ways to present cancer risk that reflect the general perception of what constitutes a risk high enough to motivate behaviour change and help patients contextualise a less well known health risk by providing a frame of reference. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors harmful to human health. Cytokeratin (CK) is highly conserved and differentiated related to the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells. The aim of the study was to explore expressions of CK20 and CK7 and corresponding prognostic values in patients with lung cancer. Our study included 258 cases of patients confirmed with lung cancer. Expressions of CK20 and CK7 mRNA and protein were detected using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively, followed by the performance of immunohistochemistry staining. Associations of CK20 and CK7 with the clinical parameters and prognosis of lung cancer patients were further analyzed. There were obvious differences regarding the positive expression of CK20 in different T stage, lymph node metastasis, invasion, size, and clinical stage subgroups; besides, significant differences in the positive expression of CK7 were also observed in subgroups of different sex, age, lymph node metastasis, invasion, and differentiation. Furthermore, effects of age, smoking, T stage, lymph node metastasis and invasion, size, and CK7 expressions were significant on the survival of patients (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis, T stage, and CK7 expression were independent risk factors for poor prognosis of involved patients (all P<0.05), while age, smoking, and invasion had no marked relation to the survival time of patients with lung cancer (all P>0.05). Positive CK20 and CK7 expressions are detected in patients with lung cancer; positive expression of CK7 associated with pathological features of lymph node metastasis and T stage may be independent clinical parameters for poor prognosis of patients with lung cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, ranking as high as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in industrialized countries. Consistent with immunosurveillance theory, the immune system is crucial to protect the host from developing tumors, and the major players in tumoral immunity are effector T cells. Anyway, cancer cells develop strategies of immunoevasion influencing the cancer-specific lymphocyte priming, activation, and effector function. Therefore, the T cell subsets that mature during the stages of tumor growth, differently contribute to disease progression and/or regression. In our study, we analyzed the intra-tumoral and peripheral T cell subsets' distribution in 30 patients with CRC, in order to clarify their functional role toward cancer. We found that percentage of infiltrating effector T cells decreased in cancer tissue than in healthy mucosa and that the tumor microenvironment negatively influences the cytolytic activity of T lymphocytes reactive to cancer cells. Moreover, we found that the tumor tissue was infiltrated by a large amount of \"not effector\" T (neT) cells with a regulatory or an anergic profile, which are unable to kill cancer cells, may be contributing to the CRC promotion. The presence of neT cells was investigated also in the peripheral blood of CRC patients, demonstrating that the peripheral T regulatory cells can inhibit the proliferation of effector T cells, confirming their immunosuppressive properties. Finally, monitoring the changes in circulating neT cells' frequencies after the tumor removal, we confirmed the role of cancer in the modulation of immune system, in particular, in supporting a Tregs-mediated immunosuppression. © 2017 Niccolai, Ricci, Russo, Nannini, Emmi, Taddei, Ringressi, Melli, Miloeva, Cianchi, Bechi, Prisco and Amedei.",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the cytotoxic potential of the cardenolide glycoside acovenoside A against non-small-cell lung cancer cells. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and the second most common cancer diagnosed. Epidemiological studies revealed a direct correlation between the regular administration of cardiac glycosides and a lower incidence of various cancers. Acovenoside A, isolated from the pericarps of Acokanthera oppositifolia, potently inhibited proliferation and induced cytotoxicity in A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cells with an IC 50 of 68 ± 3 nM after 48 h of exposure. Compared to the antineoplastic agent doxorubicin, acovenoside A was more potent in inhibiting the viability of A549 cancer cells. Moreover, acovenoside A exhibited selectivity against cancer cells, being significantly less toxic to lung fibroblasts and nontoxic for peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Analysis of the cell cycle profile in acovenoside A-treated A549 cells revealed mitotic arrest, due to accumulation of the G 2 /M regulators cyclin B 1 and CDK1, and cytokinesis failure. Furthermore, acovenoside A affected the mitochondrial membrane integrity and induced production of radical oxygen species, which resulted in induction of canonical apoptosis, manifested by caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Based on our results, acovenoside A warrants further exploration as a potential anticancer lead. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Different cells and mediators in the tumor microenvironment play important roles in the progression of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the composition of the microenvironment during tumor progression in order to discover new related biomarkers and potentials for targeted therapy. Methods: In this study, breast cancer biopsies from four different stages, and control breast biopsies were collected. Then, the mRNA expression of several markers related to different CD4+ T cell subsets including regulatory T cells (Treg), T helper (Th) type 1, 2 and 17 were determined. In addition, we investigated the expression of two inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and inflammatory mediators including FASL, IDO, SOCS1, VEGF, and CCR7. Results: The results showed that the expression of Th1 and Th17 genes was decreased in tumor tissues compared to control tissues. In addition, we found that the gene expression related to these two cell subsets decreased during cancer progression. Moreover, the expression level of TNF-α increased with tumor progression. Conclusion: We conclude that the expression of genes related to immune response and inflammation is different between tumor tissues and control tissues. In addition, this difference was perpetuated through the different stages of cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies in women. Isoflurane is one of the volatile anesthetics used extensively for inhalational anesthesia and gynecological surgery. However, the effects of isoflurane on ovarian cancer have not been fully elucidated. It is widely studied that one of the biochemical fingerprints of cancer cells is the altered energy metabolism which is characterized by preferential dependence on glycolysis for energy production in an oxygen-independent manner. In the present study, we explored the roles of isoflurane in the regulation of cellular metabolism of ovarian cancer cells. We observed the glucose uptake, lactate production and extracellular acidification of two ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3 and TOV21G were significantly stimulated by isoflurane treatments at 1 and 2 h. The glycolysis enzymes, HK2, PKM2, and LDHA were up-regulated by isoflurane. We report that miR-21 was induced by isoflurane treatments in ovarian cancer cells, leading to the elevated AKT phosphorylation and up-regulation of glycolysis enzymes. In contrast, the mitochondrial functions were suppressed by isoflurane treatments: the oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and activities of complex I, II, and IV on the electron transport chain were significantly decreased under isoflurane treatments. Importantly, ovarian cancer cells become hypersensitive to glycolysis inhibitors with isoflurane pretreatments. The present study demonstrates that isoflurane treatments drive a metabolic switch of ovarian cancer cells and contributes to the discovery and development of clinical therapeutic agents against ovarian cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in breast cancer largely results from the breast cancer stem cell like cells (BCSCs) which could be targetted to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. Cell permeabilization using microbubbles (MBs) and ultrasound (US) have the potential for delivering molecules into the cytoplasm. We aim to evaluate a new methodology of US on BCSCs. First, our findings indicated that ALDHA1+ spheres which were derived from fresh primary breast cancer samples displayed stem cell like features and were resistant to DOX. In patient cohort, we revealed the presence of a variable fraction of ALDHA1+cells in nine out of ten. We, for the first time, showed a new US-MB treatment condition which could be used on ALDHA1+ BCSCs by fluorescence measurement and calcein assay. Next, we demonstrated the efficacy of combined treatment on human BCSCs in vitro and in vivo using DOX and US-MB: the combined treatment with much reduced drug dosage significantly suppressed the stem cell like features of BCSCs and induced BCSCs apoptosis. Furthermore, we suggested that decreased ABCG2 level might be one of the mechanisms by which US-MB medicated DOX treatment. In conclusion, this new US-MB treatment condition has clinical potential in breast cancer therapy by targetting BCSCs; thereby holding benefits for breast cancer patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Several frequently used prescription drugs may affect bleeding risk. We investigated use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and statins and risk of postoperative red blood cell transfusion in breast cancer patients. Methods: Using Danish population-based registries, we identified a cohort of women who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer (n=22,238) during 2005-2012 and ascertained their use of aspirin, NSAIDs, SSRIs, and statins. For each drug, patients were categorized as users if they filled ≥1 prescription in the 60 days prior to surgery. We calculated the 14-day risk of red blood cell transfusion and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing users with nonusers for each drug and adjusting for age, cancer stage, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Results: In our cohort, 1385 (6.2%) women were aspirin users, 1794 (8.0%) were NSAID users, 1110 (4.9%) were SSRI users, and 2053 (9.1%) were statin users. The overall risk of red blood cell transfusion was 1.3%. The 14-day risk of RBC transfusion was 3.5% among aspirin users versus 1.1% among aspirin nonusers (adjusted RR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.7), and 1.8% among SSRI users versus 1.2% among SSRI nonusers (adjusted RR=1.2, 95% CI: 0.7-1.9). Red blood cell transfusion risk was increased among NSAID users, but not in a sensitivity analysis with a 30-day exposure window. Red blood cell transfusion risk was not increased among SSRI and statin users. Conclusions: Primary breast cancer surgery confers a low risk of RBC transfusion. Still, use of aspirin and possibly NSAIDs, but not SSRIs and statins, is associated with increased red blood cell transfusion. This increased risk is not explained by differences in age, stage, or comorbidity level. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal malignancies. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DANCR is a newly identified oncogenic lncRNA. However, the functional role and underlying molecular mechanisms of DANCR involved in GC progress remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the biological function and underlying mechanisms of DANCR in GC cell migration and invasion. The results showed that knockdown of DANCR inhibited migration and invasion of GC cells, whereas overexpression of DANCR showed the opposite effect. Further investigation demonstrated that lncRNA-LET was a bona fide target gene of DANCR. In addition, high DANCR and low lncRNA-LET were significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis and late clinical stage. DANCR associated with EZH2 and HDAC3 to epigenetically silence lncRNA-LET and then regulated GC migration and invasion. Taken together, these findings indicate an important role for DANCR-lncRNA-LET axis in GC cell migration and invasion, and reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism for lncRNA-LET silencing.",

    "Abstract": "Overcoming drug resistance is an important task for investigators and clinician to achieve successful chemotherapy in cancer patients. Drug resistance is caused by various factors, including the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1). The development of new, useful compounds that overcome drug resistance is urgent. SH003 is extracted from themixture of three different herbs, and its anticancer effect has been revealed in different cancer cell types. In the present study, we investigated whether SH003 is able to reverse drug resistance using paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/PAC). In our experiments, SH003 significantly decreased cell growth and colony formation in MCF-7/PAC cells and parental MCF-7 cells. This growth inhibition was related to the accumulation of cells in the sub-G0/G1 apoptotic population and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells. SH003 reduced the mRNA expression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) in MCF-7/PAC cells. SH003 also down-regulated the expression of P-gp. SH003 reversed drug efflux from MCF-7/PAC cells, resulting in rhodamine123 (Rho123) accumulation. Inhibition of drug resistance by SH003 is related to the suppression of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. SH003 decreased STAT3 activation (p-STAT3) and its nuclear translocation and inhibited the secretion of VEGF and MMP-2, which are STAT3 target genes. An STAT3 inhibitor, JAK inhibitor I and an HIF-1α inhibitor decreased cell growth in MCF-7 and MCF-7/PAC cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SH003 can overcome drug resistance, and SH003 might be helpful for chemotherapy in cancer patients.",

    "Abstract": "Brucein D (BD), a major active quassinoid in Brucea javanica, has exhibited pronounced anticancer activities. However, the biologic mechanisms have not been fully explored. In this study, BD exhibited more potent cytotoxic effect on pancreatic cancer (PanCa) cell lines, while exerted weaker cytotoxic effects on GES-1 cells (non-tumorigenic). BD was shown to elicit apoptosis through inducing both the intrinsic and extrinsic mitochondria-mediated caspase activations. Furthermore, the BD-induced apoptotic effects were dependent on the accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Pretreatment with tempol completely prevented the cellular apoptosis induced by BD, and recovered the inactivation of AKT, which suggested ROS essentially involved in BD-elicited apoptosis and down-regulation of PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, the results obtained from orthotopic xenograft in nude mice were congruent with those of the in vitro investigations. These results support the notion that BD held good potential to be further developed into an effective pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of PanCa. © 2017 Lai, Ip, Liao, Lu, Xie, Su, Chen, Xian, Leung and Lin.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cisplatin and gemcitabine combined with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of cervical cancer patients results in a favorable outcome but with excess toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity profile of dual chemotherapy and highly conformal external beam radiotherapy with image guided adaptive brachytherapy. Methods: Seventeen patients with cervical carcinoma FIGO stage IB2-IIIB were treated with curative intent between 2011 and 2015. A total dose of 50.4 Gy was prescribed to the elective pelvic nodal volume. Patients with 18FDG-PET/CT positive lymph nodes (n=15; 83.3%) received an additional boost to a total dose of 62 Gy. Chemotherapy prescription goals were: concomitant during 5 weeks of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) 40 mg/m2 cisplatin and 125 mg/m2 gemcitabine, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy from week 10 (2 cycles 50 mg/m2 cisplatin and 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine). EBRT was followed by 3-4 fractions (6 Gy per fraction) of intrauterine image guided adaptive brachytherapy. Toxicities were graded according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE v 4.0). Results: One (6%) patient developed acute grade 3 diarrhea. We did not record any other acute or late gastrointestinal or urogenital toxicity higher that grade 3. Most common acute hematological toxicity was anemia grade 2 recorded in 10 (59%) patients. There was only one case of grade 3 neutropenia (6%). The number of patients that received the complete chemotherapy regimen was gradually declining during the course of therapy. From week 2 to 5, gemcitabine was omitted in 4 (24%),7 (41%), 8 (47%), and 12 (71%) patients respectively, similarly, cisplatin was omitted in 2 (12%),3 (18%),1 (6%) and 7 (41%) patients respectively. Adjuvant chemotherapy was omitted in 8 patients (47%). During a median follow-up time of 20 months (5 to 63 months) 6 (35%) patients developed disease relapse with 5 (29%) of them in the form of systemic disease. Conclusions: In contrast to previous findings cisplatin and gemcitabine in combination with highly conformal radiation therapy seems to have an acceptable toxicity profile. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of the proposed therapy concept. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Despite a myriad of attempts in the last three decades to diagnose ovarian cancer (OC) earlier, this clinical aim still remains a significant challenge. Aberrant methylation patterns of linked CpGs analyzed in DNA fragments shed by cancers into the bloodstream (i.e. cell-free DNA) can provide highly specific signals indicating cancer presence. Methods: We analyzed 699 cancerous and non-cancerous tissues using a methylation array or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to discover the most specific OC methylation patterns. A three-DNA-methylation-serum-marker panel was developed using targeted ultra-high coverage bisulfite sequencing in 151 women and validated in 250 women with various conditions, particularly in those associated with high CA125 levels (endometriosis and other benign pelvic masses), serial samples from 25 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and a nested case control study of 172 UKCTOCS control arm participants which included serum samples up to two years before OC diagnosis. Results: The cell-free DNA amount and average fragment size in the serum samples was up to ten times higher than average published values (based on samples that were immediately processed) due to leakage of DNA from white blood cells owing to delayed time to serum separation. Despite this, the marker panel discriminated high grade serous OC patients from healthy women or patients with a benign pelvic mass with specificity/sensitivity of 90.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 84.3-94.8%) and 41.4% (95% CI = 24.1-60.9%), respectively. Levels of all three markers plummeted after exposure to chemotherapy and correctly identified 78% and 86% responders and non-responders (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.04), respectively, which was superior to a CA125 cut-off of 35 IU/mL (20% and 75%). 57.9% (95% CI 34.0-78.9%) of women who developed OC within two years of sample collection were identified with a specificity of 88.1% (95% CI = 77.3-94.3%). Sensitivity and specificity improved further when specifically analyzing CA125 negative samples only (63.6% and 87.5%, respectively). Conclusions: Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns in cell-free DNA have the potential to detect a proportion of OCs up to two years in advance of diagnosis and may potentially guide personalized treatment. The prospective use of novel collection vials, which stabilize blood cells and reduce background DNA contamination in serum/plasma samples, will facilitate clinical implementation of liquid biopsy analyses. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Multifunctional core–shell nanocomposites are excellent platforms for effective drug delivery, and controlled release is attracting increasing attention from researchers owing to its advantages in cancer therapy. Here, a new nanocomposite containing nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) embedded in ferromagnetic Fe3O4 cores and a pH-sensitive shell constituted by hydroxyapatite (HA) with loaded 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was successfully synthesized. The nanocomposite can be used for near-infrared laser-induced photothermal cancer therapy and synergetic chemotherapy. The pH-sensitive HA shell exhibits a high drug-loading capability and achieves a pH-controlled and multistage drug release.

    "Abstract": "T-lymphocyte activation plays an important role in suppressing the development of human cancers including breast cancer (BC). Cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) is the primary T-cell costimulatory molecule and enhances T-cell activation and proliferation. To examine the role of CD28 gene polymorphism in BC, we conducted a case-control study involving 312 BC patients and 312 controls in a Chinese Han population. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to analyze the expression level of CD28 and its association with overall survival (OS) of BC. Genotyping was performed using a custom-by-design 48-Plex single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ScanTM Kit. Our results indicated that CD28 mRNA level was down-regulated in the BC patients, whereas high expression of CD28 showed better OS for BC. In addition, an increased risk of BC was associated with the rs3116496 CC genotype of CD28 gene (CC vs. TT). The significant association was also observed in the recessive model. In conclusion, CD28 may be a tumor suppressor gene and rs3116496 polymorphism of CD28 gene showed positively correlation with the increased risk of BC. However, larger studies with more diverse ethnic populations are needed to confirm these results. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Our previous studies showed that vasoconstrictor applied topically to rat skin minutes before irradiation completely prevented radiodermatitis. Here we report on a Phase IIa study of topically applied NG12-1 vasoconstrictor to prevent radiodermatitis in post-lumpectomy breast cancer patients who received at least 40 Gray to the whole breast using standard regimens. Methods: Patients had undergone surgery for Stage Ia, Ib, or IIa infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma of the breast or ductal carcinoma in situ. NG12-1 formulation was applied topically to the same 50-cm2 treatment site within the radiation field 20 min before each daily radiotherapy fraction. Results: Scores indicated significant reductions in radiodermatitis at the NG12-1 treatment site versus control areas in the same radiotherapy field. The mean dermatitis score for all subjects was 0.47 (SD 0.24) in the NG12-1-treated area versus 0.72 (SD 0.22) in the control area (P =0.022). Analysis by two independent investigators indicated radiodermatitis reductions in 9 of the 9 patients with scorable radiodermatitis severity, and one patient with insufficient radiodermatitis to enable scoring. There were no serious adverse events from NG12-1 treatment. Conclusions: Thirty, daily, NG12-1 treatments, topically applied minutes before radiotherapy, were well tolerated and conferred statistically significant reductions in radiodermatitis severity (P =0.022).

    "Abstract": "Oxyprenylated compounds (i.e., ferulic acid and coumarin derivatives) demonstrate neuroprotection and anticancer properties as reported in previous studies. We have tested the affinity of oxyprenylated ferulic acid (1-4) and umbelliferone derivatives (5-11) to melatonin receptors as well as their antiproliferation and antimigratory properties against breast cancer (BC) cell lines. All the compounds except for ferulic acid, boropinic acid, and umbelliferone had binding affinities to melatonin receptors in the nM to μM range, and both auraptene and umbellinprenin reduced BC cell proliferation and migration in phenotypically diverse BC including triple negative. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gardasil®, a quadrivalent vaccine targeting low-risk (6, 11) and high-risk (16, 18) human papillomaviruses (HPV), has been offered to 11-14 year-old schoolgirls in Switzerland since 2008. To evaluate its success and its potential impact on cervical cancer screening, HPV genotypes were examined in 18-year-old girls five years later (sub-study 1) and in outpatients participating to cervical cancer screening before and after vaccine implementation (sub-study 2). Methods: For sub-study 1, 3726 females aged 18 in 2013 were invited to fill a questionnaire on personal demographics and HPV risk factors and to provide a self-collected cervicovaginal sample for HPV genotyping and Chlamydia trachomatis PCR. Personal data were evaluated by univariable and multivariable statistics. In sub-study 2, the proportion of the vaccine-type HPV among anogenital HPV was examined with archived genotyping data of 8039 outpatients participating to cervical cancer screening from 1999 till 2015. The yearly evolution of this proportion was evaluated by segmented logistic regression. Results: 690 (18.5%) women participated to sub-study 1 and 327 (8.8%) provided a self-collected sample. Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (4.6%) and demographics confirmed that the subjects were representative of sexually-active Swiss young women. Vaccine (five-year coverage: 77.5%) was preferentially accepted by contraceptive-pill users (P = 0.001) and samples were mainly provided by sexually-active subjects (P < 0.001). The proportion (4%) of the vaccine-type HPV in this population was lower than in sub-study 2 outpatients (n = 849, <26 years old) in the pre-vaccine era (25.7%). The proportion of the high-risk vaccine-type HPV decreased significantly (59%, P = 0.0048) in the outpatients during the post-vaccine era, yet this decrease was restricted to those aged less than 26 years (n = 673, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The low proportion of vaccine-type HPV in 18-year-old females and its rapid decrease in young women participating to cervical cancer screening extend the success of HPV vaccination to Switzerland. Our data suggest that cervical cancer screening is now entering a stage of reduced proportion of HPV16 and/or 18 in samples reported positive by cytology. In view of the high likelihood of reduced clinical specificity of cytology, primary screening modalities involving HPV testing and cytology should now be re-evaluated in Switzerland. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chemoresistance is a major obstacle that limits the benefits of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu)-based chemotherapy for colon cancer patients. Autophagy is an important cellular mechanism underlying chemoresistance. Recent research advances have given new insights into the use of natural bioactive compounds to overcome chemoresistance in colon cancer chemotherapy. As one of the multitargeted and safer phytomedicines, curcumin has been reported to work as cancer-specific chemosensitizer, presumably via induction of autophagic signaling pathways. The precise therapeutic effect of curcumin on autophagy in determining tumorous cells' fate, however, remains unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the differential modulations of the treatments either with 5-Fu alone or 5-Fu combined with curcumin on cellular autophagic responses and viabilities in the human colon cancer cells HCT116 and HT29, and explore molecular signaling transductions underlying the curcumin-mediated autophagic changes and potentiation of 5-Fu's cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Cell proliferation assay and morphology observation were used to identify the cytotoxicity of different combinations of curcumin and 5-Fu in HCT116 and HT29 cells. Cell immunofluorescence assay, Flow cytometry and Western blot were employed to detect changes of autophagy and the autophagy-related signaling pathways in the colon cancer cells and/or xenograft mice. Results: Curcumin could significantly augment the cytotoxicity of 5-Fu to the tumorous cells, and the pre-treatment with curcumin followed by 5-Fu (pre-Cur) proved to be the most effective one compared to other two combinations. The chemosensitizing role of curcumin might attribute to the autophagy turnover from being activated in 5-Fu mono-treatment to being inhibited in the pre-Cur treatment as indicated by the changes in expression of beclin-1, p62 and LC3II/LC3I and the intensity of Cyto-ID Green staining. The autophagic alterations appeared to be contributed by down-regulation of not only the phospho-Akt and phospho-mTOR expressions but the phospho-AMPK and phospho-ULK1 levels as well. The cellular activation of AMPK by addition of A-769662 to the pre-Cur combination resulted in reversed changes in expressions of the autophagy protein markers and apoptotic status compared to those of the pre-Cur combination treatment. The findings were validated in the xenograft mice, in which the tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the mice with 25-day combination treatment, and meanwhile expressions of the autophagy markers, P-AMPK and P-ULK1 were all reversely altered in line with those observed in HCT116 cells. Conclusion: Pre-treatment with curcumin followed by 5-Fu may mediate autophagy turnover both in vitro and in vivo via AMPK/ULK1-dependent autophagy inhibition and AKT modulation, which may account for the increased susceptibility of the colon cancer cells/xenograft to the cytotoxicity of 5-Fu. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "An efficient and convergent synthesis of 5′-hydroxyzearalenone and 5′β-hydroxyzearalenone, 14-membered β-resorcylic acid lactone (RAL) natural products, has been achieved in a longest linear sequence of 19 steps, and a total of 29 steps, starting from commercially available 5-hexen-1-ol and methyl 2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)acetate. The key features of our synthesis include a Jacobsen hydrolytic kinetic resolution, a Mitsunobu esterification and (an E)-selective ring-closing metathesis (RCM). Our synthesis also highlights the utility of the acetal protecting group for the resorcylate moiety, and its compatibility with RCM reactions for the synthesis of 14-membered RALs. The cytotoxic activity of both synthetic compounds was evaluated against seven human cancer cell lines. 5′-Hydroxyzearalenone shows more potent cytotoxic activity against most of the cancer cell lines tested than its epimer, 5′β-hydroxyzearalenone. Both compounds show significant cytotoxic activity against the C33A cervical cancer cell line, with IC50 values of 21.33 ± 6.43 µm and 16.00 ± 12.17 µm, respectively. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticles (NPs)-based diagnosis and phototherapy are emerging as the cutting-edge technologies for detection and treatment of cancer but their applications are still limited since insufficient and heterogeneous NPs accumulation in cancer often causes recurrence. To overcome these limitations, multifunctional microbubbles (MBs) were constructed with 1, 1-dioctadecyl-3, 3, 3, 3-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) and porphyrin grafted lipid (PGL). Both DiR and PGL self-assembled as microbubbles, the as-designed PGL-DiR MBs possess remarkably high drug loading contents (5.8% PGL and 10.38% DiR) and stable co-delivery drug combinations. In vivo experiments showed PGL-DiR MBs could serve as an excellent ultrasound contrast agent to enhance ultrasound imaging greatly for identifying the location and size of the tumors. Upon exposure to ultrasound, in situ conversion of PGL-DiR MBs into nanoparticles resulted in a remarkable increase in fluorescence intensity (~5 folds) in tumor compared with PGL-DiR NPs, validating the enhanced tumor accumulation and cellular uptake of therapeutic agents. PGL-DiR MBs showed complete tumor ablation without recurrence in vivo, while PGL-DiR NPs showed only 72.6% tumor growth inhibition at the same dose. We believe that PGL-DiR MBs will soon reach their full potential as an important class of phototherapeutic formulations and will contribute to remarkable advances in cancer treatments. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: EphA2 is a crucial oncogene in gastric cancer (GC) development and metastasis, this study aims to identify microRNAs that target it and serve as key regulators of gastric carcinogenesis. Methods: We identified several potential microRNAs targeting EphA2 by bioinformatics websites and then analyzed the role of miR-302b in modulating EphA2 in vitro and in vivo of GC, and it's mechanism. Results: Our analysis identified miR-302b, a novel regulator of EphA2, as one of the most significantly downregulated microRNA (miRNA) in GC tissues. Overexpression of miR-302b impaired GC cell migratory and invasive properties robustly and suppressed cell proliferation by arresting cells at G0-G1 phase in vitro. miR-302b exhibited anti-tumor activity by reversing EphA2 regulation, which relayed a signaling transduction cascade that attenuated the functions of N-cadherin, β-catenin, and Snail (markers of Wnt/β-catenin and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT). This modulation of EphA2 also had distinct effects on cell proliferation and migration in GC in vivo. Conclusions: miR-302b serves as a critical suppressor of GC cell tumorigenesis and metastasis by targeting the EphA2/Wnt/β-catenin/EMT pathway. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: This phase II bridging study assessed the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial [MPACT] regimen) in Chinese patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC). Methods: This 3-part sequential study evaluated nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m 2 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks. Part 1 evaluated safety. Part 2 evaluated efficacy using Simon's optimal 2-stage design: if &gt;2 responses were observed in Stage 1 (n = 28), 54 additional patients would be enrolled in Stage 2. If &gt;9 responses were observed, the study was complete. Otherwise, nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine would be compared with gemcitabine alone in Part 3. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: Eighty-three patients were treated. The prespecified primary endpoint was met: the independently assessed ORR in Stages 1 + 2 was 35% (95% CI, 24.8-46.2); therefore, Part 3 was not initiated. The median DOR was 8.9 months (95% CI, 6.01-8.94). The median OS and progression-free survival were 9.2 (95% CI, 7.6-11.1) and 5.5 (95% CI, 5.29-7.16) months, respectively. The 12-month OS rate was 30%. In an updated analysis, the median OS was 9.3 months and the 12-month OS rate was 32%. Longer OS was observed in patients with baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≤ 5 vs &gt; 5. The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were leukopenia (35%), neutropenia (34%), anemia (15%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and fatigue (13%). Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7% of patients (no grade 4 reported). Conclusions: The MPACT regimen of nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine is efficacious in Chinese patients with MPC. No new safety signals were observed. Trial registration:NCT02135822, May 8, 2014. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Melanoma is the most malignant skin cancer, which account for most of skin-cancer-related deaths. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a class of noncoding RNAs with crucial roles in many cancers. However, the roles of lncRNAs in melanoma have not been well studied. In the present study, using public available data and clinical tissues samples, we found that lncRNA ILF3-AS1 is up-regulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines, and correlated with poor prognosis of melanoma patients. Functional experiments showed that knockdown of ILF3-AS1 inhibits melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, we found that ILF3-AS1 interacts with EZH2, promotes the binding of EZH2 to the miR-200b/a/429 promoter, and represses miR-200b/a/429 expression. The expression of ILF3-AS1 is negatively correlated with that of miR-200b/a/429 in melanoma tissues. Moreover, inhibition of miR-200b/a/429 abrogates the biological roles of ILF3-AS1 knockdown on melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that melanoma-upregulated lncRNA ILF3-AS1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via negatively regulating miR-200b/a/429, and imply that ILF3-AS1 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for melanoma.",

    "Abstract": "The association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility has been researched in numerous studies. However, the results of these studies were controversial. Therefore, the objective of this meta-analysis was to offer a more convincible conclusion about such association with more included studies. Eligible studies published till May 1, 2017 were searched from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI database about such association. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate such association. And the Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test were applied to assess the publication bias. This meta-analysis contained 37049 cases and 52444 controls from 87 publications with 91 eligible case-control studies. Because of lack of data for a particular genotype in several studies, all the included studies were analysed barely in the dominant model. Originally, there was no association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and CRC susceptibility (OR =0.99, 95% CI =0.94-1.05). After excluding 13 studies according to their heterogeneity and publication bias, rs1801133 polymorphism was found to reduce the risks of CRC significantly (OR =0.96, 95% CI =0.94-0.99). In the subgroup analysis of ethnicity, there was a significant association in Asians (OR =0.94, 95% CI =0.89-1.00). Furthermore, when stratified by the source of controls and genotyping methods, the positive results were observed in population-based control group (OR =0.97, 95% CI =0.93-1.00) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)method (OR =0.95, 95% CI =0.91-0.99. The results of themeta-analysis suggested that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with CRC susceptibility, especially in Asian population. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The patient is a girl aged 17 years who originally presented at age 11 years with a solid pseudopapillary tumour (SPT) in the head of the pancreas treated by an R0 pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure. The patient underwent surveillance CT every 3 months for the first year followed by MRI every 6 months. She was noted to have a new liver lesion in Couinaud segment VI highly suspicious for metastasis at 30 months. Liver wedge biopsy confirmed metastatic SPT. Two months later two new lesions were noted in Couinaud segment VII. The family preferred medical management to surgery resulting in a treatment combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib and hepatic artery embolisation. The patient developed a hepatic abscess following embolisation but recovered with antibiotics. The patient has subsequently been followed with serial MRIs every 3 months, and 20 months following chemoembolisation, she has no evidence of recurrence of the metastases. © BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast metastases from extramammary tumors are extremely rare, the most common primary tumors being contralateral breast carcinoma, followed by lung, gynecological, gastrointestinal, melanoma, and hematological cancers. Only a few cases deriving from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in the literature to date. Case presentation: We report a case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to our hospital with a solitary breast lesion in the right upper external quadrant associated with multiple bone and visceral metastases. Two years before, she had undergone radical resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (stage pT2, pN1), which was followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Breast ultrasound showed a hypoechogenic tumor lesion of 4 cm in the right upper external quadrant that was associated with multiple axillary and infra-/supraclavicular adenopathies. A positron emission tomographic scan documented multiple visceral and bone metastases with a single hypermetabolic lesion of the right breast. The results of histology and immunohistochemistry were consistent with a metastasis from a squamous cell carcinoma. The patient died of acute respiratory insufficiency 1 month after her breast metastasis diagnosis and before starting any systemic antitumoral treatment. Conclusions: Although breast metastases are extremely rare, they should be considered in any patient with a history of cancer and confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry because they are very difficult to distinguish from other primary breast tumors based only on clinical and radiological features. There are no standardized treatment guidelines for breast metastasis management. Surgery and radiotherapy can play a role in symptom palliation, but they do not have any relevant impact on survival, the prognosis being poor, with an estimated overall survival less than 1 year from diagnosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous multifunctional enzyme usually known as a tumor suppressor. Recent studies have reported that although inhibition of PP2A leads to acceleration of cell growth, it also induces damaged cells to pass through the cell cycle and renders them sensitive to radiotherapy. Here, we investigated the radiosensitizing effects of digoxin as a PP2A inhibitor in two non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell types (H460 and A549) with differential sensitivity to radiation. Digoxin inhibited the proliferation of H460 and A549 cells in a dose-dependent fashion and was especially effective on radioresistant A549 cells. Interestingly, the radiosensitizing effect of digoxin was only present in the radioresistant A549 cells and xenografts. The combination of digoxin and ionizing radiation (IR) significantly reduced clonogenic survival and xenograft tumor growth (P<0.001), compared with IR alone. Digoxin suppressed PP2A protein expression and prevented IR-induced PP2A expression in A549 cells. Digoxin treatment combined with IR allowed the damaged cell to progress through the cell cycle via suppression of cell cycle-related proteins (p53, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, CDK4, and p-cdc2). Moreover, digoxin enhanced IR-induced DNA damage through reduction in levels of repair proteins and elevation of p-ATM foci formation up to 24 h (P<0.001). In conclusion, digoxin has a novel function as a PP2A inhibitor, and combined with IR produces a synergistic effect on radiosensitizing cells, thereby indicating a potentially promising therapeutic approach to radioresistant lung cancer treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC) remains an important health problem in China. In the present study, through the use of siRNA, specific gene knockdown of transcription factor 3 gene (TCF-3) was achieved in vitro and the effect of TCF-3 gene on human EC Eca-109 cell proliferation and apoptosis. Eca-109 cells were treated using negative control (NC) of siRNA against TCF-3 (siTCF-3) and siTCF-3 group. Colony formation assay was used to detect the colony formation ability in Eca-109 cells. MTT assay was used to measure the cell growth and viability, whereas BrDU assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation, and flow cytometry (FCM) to assess cell apoptosis. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was applied to measure TCF-3 gene expression. Protein expressions of TCF-3, apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 were determined using Western blotting. Transfection of siTCF-3 successfully down-regulated TCF-3 gene expression. In addition, siTCF-3, reduced Eca-109 cell viability and proliferation, in a time-dependent manner, and inhibited progression of cell cycle from G0/G1 to S-stage. When treated with siTCF-3, the Eca-109 cells exhibited increased apoptosis, with up-regulated cleaved caspase and Bax expressions, whereas Bcl-2 expression was down-regulated. The present study shows that TCF-3 gene silencing inhibits Eca-109 cell growth and proliferation, suppresses cell cycle progression, and promotes apoptosis, which might serve as a new objective for EC treatment.",

    "Abstract": "A recent study indicated that high Wnt5a expression is associated with poor prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, the underlying mechanism was not clear yet. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were performed to examine the protein expression level in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The role of Wnt5a in clone formation, invasiveness, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NSCLC cells was studied. Luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. For assessing the effects of Wnt5a on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, A549 cells transfected with sh-Wnt5a were subcutaneously or orthotopically injected into nude mice. In NSCLC tissues, higher expression levels of Wnt5a and ROR2 were found, β-Catenin was expressed exceptionally, and EMT was prompted. Wnt5a overexpression increased clone formation, migration, and invasion, as well as prompted EMT of NSCLC cell in vitro, whereas Wnt5a knockdown showed the absolutely reversed results. Wnt5a overexpression enhanced the Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and elevated the nuclear β-catenin level in NSCLC cells, without altering the ROR2 expression. We also demonstrated that si-β-catenin antagonized Wnt5a overexpression nduced EMT and invasiveness. Besides, in vivo experiment showed that sh-Wnt5a significantly increased tumor volume and tumor weight, and prompted EMT in A549 tumor-bearing mice as compared with the control. No metastasis was found in the liver tissue after sh-Wnt5a-transfected cells were orthotopically injected into nude mice as compared with the control. In conclusion, Wnt5a promotes EMT and metastasis in NSCLC, which is involved in the activation of β-catenin-dependent canonical Wnt signaling.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in Bolivia are among the highest in Latin America. This investigation aims to evaluate the possibility of using simple devices, e.g. a cotton swab and a glass slide, for self-sampling in order to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA by PCR in cervico-vaginal cells. Methods: In the first phase of our study we evaluated the use of a glass slide as a transport medium for cervical cells. A physician took paired-cervical samples from 235 women. One sample was transported in Easyfix® solution and the other sample was smeared over a glass slide. Both were further analyzed and compared for human DNA recovery and HPV detection. A kappa value was determined to evaluate the agreement between the HPV DNA detection rates. In the second phase of the study, 222 women from the urban, peri-urban and rural regions of Cochabamba were requested to perform self-sampling using the following devices: a cotton swab combined with a glass slide, and a vaginal tampon. Women gave their opinion about the self-sampling technique. Finally, the agreement for high risk-HPV detection between self- and physician-collected samples was performed in 201 samples in order to evaluate the self-sampling technique. Results: Firstly, the comparison between Easyfix® solution and the glass slide to transport clinical samples gave a good agreement for HPV DNA detection (Κ = 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.81). Secondly, self-sampling, especially with cotton swab combined with glass slide, would generally be preferred over clinician sampling for a screening program based on HPV detection. Finally, we showed a good agreement between self- and physician collected samples for high risk-HPV detection (Κ = 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.88). Conclusions: Simple devices such as a cotton swab and a glass slide can be used to perform self-sampling and HPV DNA detection. Furthermore, most Bolivian women preferred self-sampling over clinician-sampling for cervical cancer screening. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Folic acid (FA), which is necessary for normal cell division of mammals, has been implicated to be involved in many tumors. Dietary FA intake has been reported to be associated with a lower risk of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). However, the molecular mechanisms of FA in NPC cells remain unclear. In the present study, we found that FA treatment dose dependently inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of NPC cells, via folate receptor α (FRα). We further found that FA, bound to FRα, induced the activation of MEK/ERK1/2, and increased the expressions of TSLC1 and E-cadherin. Moreover, blocking of ERK1/2 activation attenuated FA-mediated increase in TSLC1 expression. In addition, knockdown of TSLC1 abolished the FA-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and suppressed the FA-mediated increase oinE-cadherin expression in NPC cells. Taken together, our data suggest that FA treatment inhibits NPC cell proliferation and invasion via activation of FRα/ERK1/2/ TSLC1 signaling pathway. Therefore, FA could be explored as a therapeutic drug for the treatment of NPC, and TSLC1 may act as a tumor suppressor in NPC.",

    "Abstract": "Monitoring biomarkers and injected theranostic nanomaterials in tissues and organs plays a pivotal role in numerous medical applications ranging from cancer diagnostics to drug delivery. Scanning electrochemical microscopy has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to create highly resolved maps of the distributions of relevant biomolecules in cells and tissues without suffering from the optical interferences of conventional microscopy. We demonstrate for the first time the application of soft microelectrodes brushing in contact mode over large and thick tissues as well as organs that were immersed in an electrolyte solution. Amperometric currents were recorded based on the local flux of redox-active species locally and specifically generated by the biomarkers and nanomaterials to create maps of the biodistribution of graphene oxide nanoribbons in mouse livers, prognostic protein biomarkers in human melanoma and redox-active proteins in mouse heart. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Six new pairs of bibenzyl-based meroterpenoid enantiomers, (±)-rasumatranin A-D (1-4) and (±)-radulanin M and N (5 and 6), and six known compounds were isolated from the adnascent Chinese liverwort, Radula sumatrana. Their structures were elucidated based on spectroscopic data and chiral phase HPLC-ECD analyses. The structures of 1 and 7 were also confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Cytotoxicity tests of the isolated compounds showed that 6-hydroxy-3-methyl-8-phenylethylbenzo[b]oxepin-5-one (8) showed activity against the human cancer cell lines MCF-7, PC-3, and SMMC-7721, with IC 50 values of 3.86, 6.60, and 3.58 μM, respectively, and induced MCF-7 cell death through a mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

    "Abstract": "The multifunctional nanocomposites with grafting polyamidoamine dendrimers up to third generation (G 3 ) are grown onto the surface of mesoporous silica-coated gold nanorods (AuNRs@SiO 2 ) via a divergent technique. The resultant AuNRs@SiO 2 -G 3 nanocomposites with uniform size and excellent stability not only enable their utilization as targeted contrast agents for photothermal cancer therapy but also serve as scaffolds for the intracellular delivery of anticancer drug and small interfering RNA (siRNA) to enhance the efficiency of cancer therapy. The controlled doxorubicin (DOX) release from AuNRs@SiO 2 -G 3 nanocomposites is significantly improved under lower pH condition and near-infrared laser irradiation. The Bcl-2-targeted siRNA is transfected into tumor cells and induces knockdown of the protein expression, which is confirmed by western blot assays. Furthermore, the complementary effect of chemo- and gene therapy to MCF-7 cells for improved photothermal therapy is demonstrated by MTT assay. The DOX and siRNA coloaded AuNRs@SiO 2 -G 3 nanocomposites show much lower cytotoxicity compared to the DOX, resulting in low toxicity to normal tissues. The multifunctional nanocomposites have potential application as nanoplatforms to integrate the photothermal-chemo-gene tumor therapy with high efficiency. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: Systemic therapy-induced diarrhea (STID) is a common side effect experienced by more than half of cancer patients. Despite STID-associated complications and poorer quality of life (QoL), no validated assessment tools exist to accurately assess STID occurrence and severity to guide clinical management. Therefore, we developed and validated a patient-reported questionnaire (STIDAT). Methods: The STIDAT was developed using the FDA iterative process for patient-reported outcomes. A literature search uncovered potential items and questions for questionnaire construction used by oncology clinicians to develop questions for the preliminary instrument. The instrument was evaluated on its face validity and content validity by patient interviews. Repetitive, similar and different themes uncovered from patient interviews were implemented to revise the instrument to the version used for validation. Patients starting high-risk STID treatments were monitored using the STIDAT, bowel diaries and EORTC QLQ-C30. The STIDAT was evaluated for construct validity using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using minimal residual method with Promax rotation, reliability and consistency. A weighted scoring system was developed and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluated the tool's ability to detect STID occurrence. Median scores and variability were analysed to determine how well it differentiates between diarrhea severities. A post-hoc analysis determined how diarrhea severity impacted QoL of cancer patients. Results: Patients defined diarrhea based on presence of watery stool. The STIDAT assessed patient's perception of having diarrhea, daily number of bowel movements, daily number of diarrhea episodes, antidiarrheal medication use, the presence of urgency, abdominal pain, abdominal spasms or fecal incontinence, patient's perception of diarrhea severity, and QoL. These dimensions were sorted into four clusters using EFA - patient's perception of diarrhea, frequency of diarrhea, fecal incontinence and abdominal symptoms. Cronbach's alpha was 0.78; kappa ranged from 0.934-0.952, except for abdominal spasms (Κ = 0.0455). The positive predictive value was 96.4%, with the minimum score of 1.35 predicting a positive STID occurrence. Patients with moderate or severe diarrhea experience significant decreases in QoL compared to those with no diarrhea. Conclusions: This is the first patient-reported questionnaire that accurately predicts the occurrence and severity of diarrhea in oncology patients via assessing several bowel habit dimensions. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Four new polyketides, penitalarins A-C (1-3) and nafuredin B (4), together with the known biogenetically related nafuredin A (5) were isolated from a mixed culture of a deep-sea-derived fungus Talaromyces aculeatus and a mangrove-derived fungus Penicillium variabile. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed that none of compounds 1-5 was produced by either of the two fungi when cultured alone under the same condition. The structures of 1-4, including absolute configurations, were deduced based on the interpretation of MS, NMR data, and time-dependent density functional theory calculations of specific electronic circular dichroism spectra. Compounds 1-3 possess a 3,6-dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane ring, and 4 showed cytotoxicity with IC 50 values ranging from 1.2 to 9.8 μM against a panel of human cancer cell lines. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the study is to investigate the correlation between the expression of C-reactive protein (CRP) and autophagy-related 9B (ATG9B) and pathological features of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) patients. We also intended to explore the effects of manipulated expression of CRP and ATG9B on the apoptosis and cell cycle progression of CCRCC cell line. ATG9B expression in CCRCC tissues and adjacent renal tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Gene expression was determined at transcription and translational levels using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. The association between CRP/ATG9B expression and clinical-pathological parameters including age, gender, pathological grades, TNM stage and distant metastasis of the patients was assessed by correlation analysis. siRNA and overexpression plasmids construction were used to manipulate the expression of CRP in human CCRCC cell line 786-O. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression were determined using flow cytometry (FCM) and Hoechst 33258 staining. CRP expression correlates with ATG9B expression. The expression of CRP and ATG9B are significantly correlated with TNM staging, distant metastasis, and survival time of CCRCC patients. A high-level of CRP indicates a poor overall survival (OS). In addition, CRP expression influences cell cycle and apoptosis of CCRCC cells. The study reveals that CRP might be a CCRCC development promoter. In addition, there is a close relationship between CRP and ATG9B in CCRCC carcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "DNA methylation and demethylation play a critical role in the regulation of the molecular pathogenesis of gliomas. Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) catalyses the sequential oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, (5hmC) leading to eventual DNA demethylation. It has been reported that TET1 is a tumour suppressor in several cancers. However, whether TET1 plays a role in glioma development is largely unclear. Different glioma specimens and corresponding normal controls were collected to analyse the expression of TET1. At the same time, TET1 of glioma U251 cells was knocked down or overexpressed to observe its effect on glioma cell proliferation and invasion as well as autophagy level. Here, we reported that the expression of TET1 in glioma tissue was significantly lower than the corresponding non-tumour normal tissues, and the concentration of TET1 is negatively correlated with the glioma WHO classification. When TET1 gene in glioma U251 cells was knocked down by CRISPR/Caspase-9 system, the proliferation and invasive ability of U251 increased remarkably. But when TET1 was overexpressed in U251 cells, the proliferation and invasion were impaired. Following the down-expression of TET1, the level of autophagy in U251 cells decreased accordingly.However, when TET1 was overexpressed in U251 cells, the level of autophagy incraesed. Furthermore, bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) but not 3-methyladenine (3-MA) could decrease the autophagy level of TET1-/- U251 cells as the wild-type controls. It suggests that the tumour suppressor effect of TET1 seems to be mediated by regulating the level of autophagy, and the regulation of TET1 on autophagy is at an early stage.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Children and adolescents dying from complex chronic conditions require paediatric palliative care. One aim of palliative care is to enable a home death if desired and well supported. However, there is little data to inform care, particularly from countries without paediatric palliative care, which constitute the majority worldwide. Methods: This is an epidemiological study analysing death certificate data of decedents aged between 0 and 17 years in Portugal, a developed Western European country without recognised provision of paediatric palliative care, from 1987 to 2011. We analysed death certificate data on cause and place of death; the main outcome measure was home death. Complex chronic conditions included cancer, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, congenital/genetic, respiratory, metabolic, gastro-intestinal, renal, and haematology/immunodeficiency conditions. Multivariate analysis determined factors associated with home death in these conditions. Results: Annual deaths decreased from 3268 to 572. Of 38,870 deaths, 10,571 were caused by complex chronic conditions, their overall proportion increasing from 23.7% to 33.4% (22.4% to 45.4% above age 1-year). For these children, median age of death increased from 0.5 to 4.32-years; 19.4% of deaths occurred at home, declining from 35.6% to 11.5%; factors associated with home death were year of death (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.90), age of death (6-10 year-olds 21.46, 16.42-28.04, reference neonates), semester of death (October-March 1.18, 1.05-1.32, reference April-September), and cause of death (neuromuscular diseases 1.59, 1.37-1.84, reference cancer), with wide regional variation. Conclusions: This first trend analysis of paediatric deaths in Portugal (an European country without paediatric palliative care) shows that palliative care needs are increasing. Children are surviving longer and, in contrast with countries where paediatric palliative care is thriving, there is a long-term trend of dying in hospital instead of at home. Age, diagnosis, season and region are associated with home death, and should be considered when planning services to support families choosing this option. Priorities should address needs of the youngest children, those with cancer, neuromuscular and cardiovascular conditions, as well as inequities related to place of residence. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Severe forms of genital endometriosis are known to be associated with infertility and its subsequent treatment failure. Both gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (a-GnRH) and dienogest have been suggested as additional hormone therapy for patients with endometriomas. However, the result of hormonal suppression before an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle remains undetermined. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study of 144 infertile women planning IVF after laparoscopic surgery of ovarian endometriomas was conducted at our department in 2012–2015. Patients were divided into three groups: group I (N = 38) with dienogest course, group II (N = 70) with a-GnRH group III (N = 70) without any hormonal therapy within 6 months preceding IVF. Results: The study groups did not differ by removed endometriomas size and ovarian reserve indicators. The gonadotropin dose per Cycle was higher, while the number of retrieved oocytes was lower in group III patients (p <.001). In women with dienogest pretreatment, clinical pregnancy rate was 2.5 times (44.7% versus 16.7%, p =.012) and delivery rate–three times higher (36.8% versus 11.1%, p =.013) as compared with those from group III. Conclusions: The present study confirms the necessity of pre-cycle medical interventions in women with ovarian forms of endometriosis undergoing IVF. We suggest dienogest to be possibly more efficient treatment option for this kind of patients. © 2017 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Bryozoans belonging to the Flustridae family have proven to be a rich source of structurally unique secondary metabolites. As part of our continuing search for bioactive secondary metabolites from Arctic marine invertebrates, the organic extract of Securiflustra securifrons was examined. This resulted in the isolation of three new halogenated, hexacyclic indole-imidazole alkaloids, securamines H-J (1-3), together with the previously reported compounds securamines C (4) and E (5). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including 1D and 2D NMR and analysis of HRMS data. Through NMR and HRMS analysis, we were also able to prove that 1, 2, 4, and 5, when dissolved in MeOH, were converted into their corresponding artifacts, the securamine MeOH adducts m1, m2, m4, and m5. When redissolved in a non-nucleophilic solvent, the native variants were re-formed. We also found that 3 was a MeOH addition product of a native variant. Even though the structures of several securamines have been reported, their bioactivities were not examined. The securamines displayed various degrees of cytotoxicity against the human cancer cell lines A2058 (skin), HT-29 (colon), and MCF-7 (breast), as well as against nonmalignant human MRC-5 lung fibroblasts. Compounds 1, 2, and 5 were found to be active, with IC 50 values against the cancer cell lines ranging from 1.4 ± 0.1 to 10 ± 1 μM. The cytotoxicity of 1 was further evaluated and found to be time-dependent. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of 18F-FDG PET/CT (PET/CT) and MRI for local and/or whole-body restaging of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck (ACC). Methods: Thirty-six patients with ACC underwent conventional MRI of the head and neck and a whole-body PET/CT and were analysed with regards to detection of a local tumor recurrence, lymph node or distant metastases. A consensus interpretation of all available imaging data was used as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, positive and negative predictive values were calculated for MRI and PET/CT. Results: The sensitivity of PET/CT and MRI was 96% (89%), specificity 89% (89%), PPV 96% (96%), NPV 89% (73%) and accuracy 94% (89%) for detection of local tumors. Additionally, PET/CT revealed lymph node metastases in one patient and distant metastases in 9/36 patients. In three patients secondary primaries were found. Conclusions: Whole-body PET/CT in addition to MRI of the head and neck improves detection of local tumour and metastastic spread in ACC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The network meta-analysis was conducted to compare the short-term efficacy of different single-drug targeted therapies in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We initially searched databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on different single-drug targeted therapies in treating RCC. The meta-analysis combined the direct and indirect evidence to calculate the pooled odds ratios (OR) and draw surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA). A total of 14 eligible RCTs were ultimately selected. The partial response (PR) of Cabozantinib in the treatment of RCC was better than Sunitinib (OR = 2.7, 95%CI = 1.0-7.8), Everolimus (OR = 8.1, 95%CI = 3.1-25.0), and Temsirolimus (OR = 4.8, 95%CI = 1.0-31.0); the overall response rate (ORR) of Cabozantinib was better than Sorafenib, Sunitinib, Everolimus, and Temsirolimus (OR = 5.5, 95%CI = 1.1-27.0; OR = 2.6, 95%CI = 1.1-6.6; OR = 8.3, 95%CI = 3.5-20.0; OR = 5.7, 95%CI = 1.3-28.0 respectively). In addition, as for complete response (CR), PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), ORR, and disease control rate (DCR), Cabozantinib had the best short-term efficacy among nine single-drug targeted therapies in the treatment of RCC (CR: 50.3%; PR: 93.6%; SD: 75.1%; PD: 68.0%; ORR: 95.5%; DCR: 73.2%); while Everolimus had the worst short-term efficacy (CR: 33.6%; PR: 22.3%; SD: 78.0%; PD: 35.9%; ORR: 22.9%; DCR: 19.9%). Our network meta-analysis indicated that Cabozantinib might have better short-term efficacy than other regimens in the treatment of RCC, while Everolimus might have poor short-term efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "Every year, hundreds of tons of organic pollutants reach the environment through effluents released from wastewater treatment plants worldwide, and many of these compounds have harmful effects on the aquatic ecosystem. A new class of emerging pollutants of high concern is cytostatic drugs, which are designed to treat different types of cancers by attacking cells. Environmental concentrations of cytostatic drugs are known to be in the range of ng L−1, and for this reason, it is imperative to develop analytical methods of extraction and preconcentration to allow for subsequent instrumental analysis of these drugs. In this work, a rapid, simple and green method for the analysis of seven cytostatic drug compounds that are commonly used in anti-cancer therapies was developed using a novel extraction process based on a powerful miniaturized technique, fabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE) coupled to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS). The major parameters that affect the extraction process were optimized. The new method shows good linearity, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 12%. Relative recoveries higher than 40% were obtained for the studied compounds, and the detection limit of the method was within the values at which these compounds are usually found in environmental water (0.20 ng L−1 to 80 ng L−1). The Limit of Quantification ranged from 0.68 to 267 ng L−1. Significant suppression of the signal due to the matrix effect, a common shortcoming attributed to interference from the extraction process as well as the use of ionization mode, was not observed.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the sensitizing effect and mechanism of diosgenin on anti-proliferation activity of mitoxantrone hydrochloride on MDR cells. METHODS: Verapamil was used as positive control. MTT method was used to evaluate the proliferation inhibition effect of diosgenin combined with mitoxantrone hydrochloride on MES-SA/MX2 cells. Western blot method (WB) and RT-qPCR were used to evaluate the effect of diosgeninon protein and gene expression of P-gp respectively. The uptake activity of TMRM was measured by flow cytometry(FCM). ATPase activity was determined by kit. RESULTS: Diosgenin can ehhance proliferation inhibition of mitoxantrone hydrochloride in MDR cell lines (MES-SA/MX2). The reversing index was 2.4 times of verapamil. Diosgenin decreased P-gp protein expression by 22.2% (P<0.01), but had marginal effect on P-gp mRNA. Diosgenin increased the fluorescence intensity of TMRM by 14.5%, and did not affect ATPase activity. CONCLUSION: Diosgenin can increase the sensitivity of mitoxantrone hydrochloride by inhibiting P-gp. Copyright 2017 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.",

    "Abstract": "Background: A series of 2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-ylthio)-N-(substituted 4-oxothiazolidin-3-yl) acetamides was synthesized and characterized by physicochemical and spectral means. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger by tube dilution method. The in vitro cytotoxicity study of the compounds was carried out against human colorectal (HCT116) cell line. The most promising anticancer derivatives (5l, 5k, 5i and 5p) were further docked to study their binding efficacy to the active site of the cyclin-dependent kinase-8. Results: All the compounds possessed significant antimicrobial activity with MIC in the range of 0.007 and 0.061 μM/ml. The cytotoxicity study revealed that almost all the derivatives were potent in inhibiting the growth of HCT116 cell line in comparison to the standard drug 5-fluorouracil. Compounds 5l and 5k (IC50 = 0.00005 and 0.00012 μM/ml, respectively) were highly cytotoxic towards HCT116 cell line in comparison to 5-fluorouracil (IC50 = 0.00615 μM/ml) taken as standard drug. Conclusion: The molecular docking studies of potent anticancer compounds 5l, 5k, 5i and 5p showed their putative binding mode and significant interactions with cyclin-dependent kinase-8 as prospective agents for treating colon cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been widely used to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutics, largely through passive accumulation provided by the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Their incorporation into biopolymer coatings enables the preparation of magnetic field-responsive, biocompatible nanoparticles that are well dispersed in aqueous media. Here we describe a synthetic route to prepare functionalized, stable magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with a temperature-responsive polymer, by means of the hydrothermal method combined with an oil/water (o/w) emulsion process. The effects of both pH and temperature on the electrophoretic mobility and surface charge of these MNPs are investigated. The magnetite/polymer composition of these systems is detected by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and quantified by thermogravimetric analysis. The therapeutic possibilities of the designed nanostructures as effective heating agents for magnetic hyperthermia are demonstrated, and specific absorption rates as high as 150 W/g, with 20 mT magnetic field and 205 kHz frequency, are obtained. This magnetic heating response could provide a promising nanoparticle system for combined diagnostics and cancer therapy. © 2017 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Acromegaly is one of the most common syndromes in pituitary adenomas. Naturally, women with this condition have trouble with their reproductive function. The difficulty in diagnosing acromegaly progression in pregnancy is that there is also production of placental growth hormone observed, making it impossible to differentiate from neoplastic growth hormone production using conventional methods of investigation. This article is about a clinical case of acromegaly in a 22 years old woman who was operated on using transnasal transsphenoidal approach and received postoperative treatment with somatostatin analog–lanreotide acetate autogel–for six months. The woman became pregnant in the course of the treatment. During pregnancy, the GH and IGF-I levels in serum remained within normal limits. Lanreotide acetate therapy was discontinued. The woman successfully gave birth to a healthy baby. There was a remission of the disease after pregnancy. © 2017 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) are chemical substances shown to interfere with endogenous hormones affecting the endocrine, immune and nervous systems of mammals. EDCs are the causative agents of diseases including reproductive disorders and cancers. This highlights the urgency to develop fast and sensitive methods to detect EDCs, which are detrimental even at very low concentrations. In this work, we propose a label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor method to detect specific EDCs (17 β-estradiol (E2), ethinyl-estradiol, 4-nonylphenol, tamoxifen) through their binding to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). We show that the use of rationally designed ERα (as bio-recognition element) in combination with conformation-sensitive peptides (as amplification agent, resulting in increased responses) enables the detection of low parts per billion (ppb) levels of E2. As a proof of concept, this bioassay was used to detect E2 in (spiked) real water samples from fish farms, rivers and the sea at low ppb levels after concentration by solid phase extraction. In addition, the present SPR assay that combines a conformation-sensitive peptide with an array of ERα mutants is very promising for the assessment of the risk of potential estrogenic activity for chemical substances. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Busulfan is an alkane sulphonate currently used as an anticancer drug and to prepare azoospermic animal models, because it selectively destroys differentiated spermatogonia in the testes. However, few studies have focussed on the exact effects of busulfan treatment on the epididymis currently. The present study assessed the effect of busulfan on epididymal morphology and the blood-epididymis barrier in mice.We treated mice with a single injection of busulfan and detected the effect at different time points. We showed that busulfan was toxic to the morphological structure and function of the epididymis. Furthermore, busulfan treatment down-regulated the epididymal expression of vimentin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, there was an increase in total androgen receptor (AR) levels, whereas the estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) levels were reduced, both in the caput and cauda regions after busulfan treatment, which may be secondary to the testicular damage. In conclusion, our study describes the effects of busulfan administration on the mouse epididymis and also provides a potential understanding of male infertility arising from chemotherapy-related defects in the epididymis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Mounting evidence has shown that KRAS and BRAF are somatic mutations associated with low grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) of the ovary. However, the frequency of KRAS or BRAF mutation was variable in literatures, with a frequency of 16-54% for KRAS mutation and 2-33% for BRAF mutation. Meanwhile, the prognostic significance of KRAS or BRAF mutation remains controversial. Methods: Codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 of KRAS gene and exon 15 of BRAF gene were analyzed using direct Sanger sequencing in 32 cases of LGSC of the ovary. The associations between KRAS or BRAF mutation and clinicopathological characteristics, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were statistically analyzed. Results: KRAS mutation was observed in nine cases (9/32, 28%) and BRAF mutation in two cases (2/32, 6%). KRAS and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive. Neither KRAS nor BRAF mutation was statistically associated with OS or DFS in our cohort, although there was a favorable prognostic trend in patients with KRAS G12D mutation than those with KRAS G12 V mutation or wild-type KRAS for OS. Conclusions: The present study indicated a low frequency of BRAF or KRAS mutation in Chinese patients with LGSC of the ovary, and neither KRAS nor BRAF mutation is a prognostic factor. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: During the last few decades, there has been a growing interest in the search for novel bioactive compounds from marine origins. Methods: The present study is the first to determine the molecular characterization which it was deposited in the genebank database, to investigate and evaluate the biological properties of sulfated polysaccharide from Cymodocea nodosa (CNSP) seagrass. Results: The results revealed that CNSP had high activity in total antioxidant assay (59.03 mg ascorbic acid equivalents/g extract), reducing power (OD = 0.3), DPPH radical scavenging (IC50 = 1.22 mg/ml) and ABTS radical scavenging (IC50 = 1.14 mg/ml). It was also noted to exhibit antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, with important inhibition zones. The results revealed that CNSP was able to inhibit the proliferation of Hela cell lines with a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: Overall, the results presented in this study demonstrate that CNSP has several attractive antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative properties with potential benefits towards health. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Human glioma is one of the malignant tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Its prognosis is poor, which is due to its genetic heterogeneity and our poor understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and their effects on the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. The expression levels of PVT1 and EZH2 in human glioma tissues and cell lines were measured using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, after siRNA-PVT1 and entire PVT1 sequence vector transfection, we determined the regulation roles of PVT1 in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. We found that the expression levels of both PVT1 and EZH2 were up-regulated in human glioma tissues and cell lines, and positively correlated with glioma malignancy. And, silencing of PVT1 expression resulted in decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased migration and invasion. In addition, exogenous PVT1 led to increased EZH2 expression and increased proliferation and induced proliferation and invasion. These data inferred that long non-coding RNA PVT1 could be served as an indicator of glioma prognosis, and PVT1-EZH2 regulatory pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for treating glioma. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death can favor dendritic cell (DC) cross-priming of tumor-associated antigens for T cell activation thanks to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, including ATP. Here, we tested the hypothesis that in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ATP release, along with its well-known immune stimulatory effect, may also contribute to the generation of an immune suppressive microenvironment. In a cohort of AML patients, undergoing combined daunorubicin and cytarabine chemotherapy, a population of T regulatory cells (Tregs) with suppressive phenotype, expressing the immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), was significantly increased. Moving from these results, initial in vitro data showed that daunorubicin was more effective than cytarabine in modulating DC function toward Tregs induction and such difference was correlated with the higher capacity of daunorubicin to induce ATP release from treated AML cells. DCs cultured with daunorubicin-treated AML cells upregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which induced anti-leukemia Tregs. These data were confirmed in vivo as daunorubicin-treated mice show an increase in extracellular ATP levels with increased number of Tregs, expressing PD-1 and IDO1+CD39+ DCs. Notably, daunorubicin failed to induce Tregs and tolerogenic DCs in mice lacking the ATP receptor P2X7. Our data indicate that ATP release from chemotherapy-treated dying cells contributes to create an immune suppressive microenvironment in AML. © 2017 Lecciso, Ocadlikova, Sangaletti, Trabanelli, De Marchi, Orioli, Pegoraro, Portararo, Jandus, Bontadini, Redavid, Salvestrini, Romero, Colombo, Di Virgilio, Cavo, Adinolfi and Curti.",

    "Abstract": "Host genotype may be closely related to the different outcomes of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To identify the association of variants and HBV infection, we comprehensively investigated the cytokine- and immune-related gene mutations in patients with HBV associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC). Fifty-three HBV-HCC patients, 53 self-healing cases (SH) with HBV infection history and 53 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited, the whole exon region of 404 genes were sequenced at >900× depth. Comprehensive variants and gene levels were compared between HCC and HC, and HCC and SH. Thirty-nine variants (adjusted P<0.0001, Fisher's exact test) and 11 genes (adjusted P<0.0001, optimal unified approach for rare variant association test (SKAT-O) gene level test) were strongly associated with HBV-HCC. Thirty-four variants were from eight human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes that were previously reported to be associated with HBV-HCC. The novelties of our study are: five variants (rs579876, rs579877, rs368692979, NM 145007:c.∗131∗130delTG, NM 139165:exon5:c.623-2->TT) from three genes (REAT1E, NOD-like receptor (NLR) protein 11 (NLRP11), hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2)) were found strongly associated with HBV-HCC. We found 39 different variants in 11 genes that were significantly related to HBV-HCC. Five of them were new findings.

    "Abstract": "Background: Mood disorder accounts for 13 % of global disease burden. And while therapeutic agents are available, usually orally administered, most have unwanted side effects, and thus making the inhalation of essential oils (EOs) an attractive alternative therapy. Rosmarinus officinalis EO (ROEO), Mediterranean ROEO reported to improve cognition, mood, and memory, the effect on stress of which has not yet been determined. Here, the anti-stress effect of ROEO on stress was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Six-week-old male ICR mice were made to inhale ROEO and subjected to tail suspension test (TST). To determine the neuronal differentiation effect of ROEO in vitro, induction of ROEO-treated PC12 cells differentiation was observed. Intracellular acetylcholine and choline, as well as the Gap43 gene expression levels were also determined. Results: Inhalation of ROEO significantly decreased the immobility time of ICR mice and serum corticosterone level, accompanied by increased brain dopamine level. Determination of the underlying mechanism in vitro revealed a PC12 differentiation-induction effect through the modulation of intracellular acetylcholine, choline, and Gap43 gene expression levels. ROEO activates the stress response system through the NGF pathway and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, promoting dopamine production and secretion. The effect of ROEO may be attributed to its bioactive components, specifically to α-pinene, one of its major compounds that has anxiolytic property. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that ROEO inhalation has therapeutic potential against stress-related psychiatric disorders. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Toxocariasis is a worldwide zoonotic parasitic disease mainly caused by Toxocara canis. Humans can be infected by accidental ingestion of T. canis embryonated ovum-contaminated food, water, or encapsulated larvae in paratenic hosts' viscera or meat. Since humans and mice are paratenic hosts of T. canis, the wandering larvae might cause mechanical tissue damage and excretory-secretory antigens may trigger inflammatory injuries to local organs. Long-term residence of T. canis larvae in a paratenic host's brain may cause cerebral toxocariasis (CT) that contributes to cerebral damage, neuroinflammation and neuropsychiatric disorders in mice and clinical patients. Since the hippocampus has been long recognized as being responsible for learning and memory functions, parasitic invasion of this site may cause neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. The present study intended to assess pathological changes, expressions of neurodegeneration-associated factors (NDAFs), including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), transglutaminase type 2 (TG2), claudin-5, substance P (SP) and interleukin (IL)-1β, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) function in the hippocampus and associated cognitive behavior in ICR mice orally inoculated with a high, medium or low-dose of T. canis embryonated ova during a 20-week investigation. Results: Results indicated although there were insignificant differences in learning and memory function between the experimental mice and uninfected control mice, possibly because the site where T. canis larvae invaded was the surrounding area but not the hippocampus per se. Nevertheless, enhanced expressions of NDAF, persistent UPS impairment and excess amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation concomitantly emerged in the experimental mice hippocampus at 8, 16 and 20 weeks post-infection. Conclusions: We thus postulate that progressive CT may still progress to neurodegeneration due to enhanced NDAF expressions, persistent UPS impairment and excess Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Toll-like receptor (TLR)7/8 plays a crucial role in host recognition/response to viruses and its mucosal expression directly correlates with intestinal inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TLR7/8 stimulation of intestinal epithelium in shaping the phenotype and functions of innate immunity cell subsets, and to define direct and/or epithelial cell-mediated mechanisms of the TLR7/8 agonist R848 immunomodulatory activity. We describe novel, TLR8-mediated, pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of R848 on ex vivo cultured human blood monocytes and γδ T lymphocytes, either induced by direct immune cell stimulation or mediated by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Apical stimulation with R848 led to its transport across normal polarized epithelial cell monolayer and resulted in the inhibition of monocyte differentiation toward immunostimulatory dendritic cells and Th1 type response. Furthermore, γδ T lymphocyte activation was promoted following direct exposure of these cells to the agonist. Conversely, a selective enrichment of the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subpopulation was observed, which required a CCL2-mediated inflammatory response of normal epithelial cells to R848. Of note, a TLR-mediated activation of control γδ T lymphocytes was promoted by inflamed intestinal epithelium from active Crohn's disease patients. This study unravels a novel regulatory mechanism linking the activation of the TLR8 pathway in IEC to the monocyte-mediated inflammatory response, and highlights the capacity of the TLR7/8 agonist R848 to directly enhance the activation of γδ T lymphocytes. Overall these results expand the range of cell targets and immune responses controlled by TLR8 triggering that may contribute to the antiviral response, to chronic inflammation, as well as to the adjuvant activity of TLR8 agonists, highlighting the role of intestinal epithelium microenvironment in shaping TLR agonist-induced responses. © 2017 Angelini, Varano, Puddu, Fiori, Baldassarre, Masotti, Gessani and Conti.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Integrative health care (IHC) is an innovative approach to health care delivery. There is increasing focus on and demand for the evaluation of IHC practices. To ensure such evaluations capture their full scope, a clear understanding of the types of outcomes relevant to an IHC approach is needed. The objective was to describe the health domains and health outcomes relevant to IHC practices in Canada. Methods: An online survey of Canadian IHC clinics. Survey questions were informed by the IN-CAM Health Outcomes Database. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Chi square tests were used to compare responses between clinic types and patient groups served. Results: Surveys were completed by 21 clinics (response rate: 50%). Physical, psychological, social, individualized and holistic were identified as applicable health domains by more than 90% of the clinics. Spiritual domain was the least relevant (70% of clinics). A number of relevant outcomes within each domain were identified. A core set of outcomes were identified and included: fatigue, anxiety, stress, and patient-provider relationship, and quality of life. Clinics with primarily conventional health practitioners were less likely to address overall well-being (p = 0.04), while clinics that provided care to a specialized patient population (i.e. cancer patients) or a mix of general and specialized patients were less likely to address religious practices (p = 0.04) or spiritual experiences (p = 0.007). Conclusions: Outcomes across health domains should be considered in the evaluation of IHC models to generate an understanding of the full scope of effectiveness of IHC approaches. The core set of outcomes identified may facilitate this task. Ethics approval (Ethics ID REB14-0495) was received from the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Pain in cancer survivors is a major and growing problem. As with all patients, cancer survivors may experience pain from common conditions unrelated to cancer. In addition, survivors may experience comorbid chronic pain acquired or exacerbated during cancer treatment. However, most chronic pain in cancer survivors is treatment related. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy and other treatments, in combination or alone, have the potential to lead to severe persistent pain. This paper presents a case of 61 year-old cancer survivor (from melanoma malignum chorioideae), who was treated with surgery and radiotherapy and as consequence of the management he suffered from chronic facial pain. Pain was managed with oxycodone/naloxon prolonged release tablets, pregabaline and duloxetine with good pain control. © Copyright Via Medica.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The identification of prognostic biomarkers for cancer patients is essential for cancer research. These days, DNA methylation has been proved to be associated with cancer prognosis. However, there are few methods which identify the prognostic markers based on DNA methylation data systematically, especially considering the interaction among DNA methylation sites. Methods: In this paper, we first evaluated the stabilities of microRNA, mRNA, and DNA methylation data in prognosis of cancer. After that, a rank-based method was applied to construct a DNA methylation interaction network. In this network, nodes with the largest degrees (10% of all the nodes) were selected as hubs. Cox regression was applied to select the hubs as prognostic signature. In this prognostic signature, DNA methylation levels of each DNA methylation site are correlated with the outcomes of cancer patients. After obtaining these prognostic genes, we performed the survival analysis in the training group and the test group to verify the reliability of these genes. Results: We applied our method in three cancers (ovarian cancer, breast cancer and Glioblastoma Multiforme). In all the three cancers, there are more common ones of prognostic genes selected from different samples in DNA methylation data, compared with gene expression data and miRNA expression data, which indicates the DNA methylation data may be more stable in cancer prognosis. Power-law distribution fitting suggests that the DNA methylation interaction networks are scale-free. And the hubs selected from the three networks are all enriched by cancer related pathways. The gene signatures were obtained for the three cancers respectively, and survival analysis shows they can distinguish the outcomes of tumor patients in both the training data sets and test data sets, which outperformed the control signatures. Conclusions: A computational method was proposed to construct DNA methylation interaction network and this network could be used to select prognostic signatures in cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "First being described in 1959 as pelvic peritoneal mesothelioma resembling ovarian papillary cystadenocarcinoma and it has been characterized that ovaries have been minimally involved or never involved as peritoneal tumour despite similar with advanced stage ovarian cancer as clinical findings and appearance in literature. In this context, in an effort to better define this patient population and to develop more organized treatment strategies, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) developed a concise set of criteria for this diagnostic category (mostly serous type): Both ovaries must be either physiologically normal in size or enlarged by a benign process, involvement in the extraovarian sites must be greater than involvement on the surface of either ovary, being of microscopic ovarian component. Actually, disseminated carcinomatosis on peritoneal surfaces is heterogenous clinic entity and gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast or genital system may cause malignant deposits. Primary peritoneal cancer patients show great similarities with advanced stage ovarian cancer patients as clinically, histologically and molecularly. Therefore, there has been significant progress on the pathogenesis recently. When salpingo-oopherectomy specimens have been examined in patients with hereditary breast ovary cancer syndrome, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) foci were found. For this reason, it has been proven that both advanced stage serous ovarian cancers and the majority of peritoneal cancers began as tubal. Although there has not been progress finding a treatment for the disease yet, there is a hope to find disease before it spreads. © 2017 by Türkiye Klinikleri.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To analyze the diagnostic value of a circular RNA (circRNA), circ-LDLRAD3, in pancreatic cancer. METHODS Expression levels of circ-LDLRAD3 were tested in both cells and clinical samples; the latter included 30 paired pancreatic cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues, 31 plasma samples from patients with pancreatic cancer, and 31 plasma samples from healthy volunteers. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure expression levels of circ-LDLRAD3 in cells and clinical samples; then, the relationship between clinicopathological factors of patient samples and expression of circ-LDLRAD3 in pancreatic cancer was analyzed. The diagnostic value of circ-LDLRAD3 was verified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS Circ-LDLRAD3 was up-regulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines (P < 0.01), pancreatic cancer tissues (P < 0.01), and plasma samples from patients with pancreatic cancer (P < 0.01). High expression of circ-LDLRAD3 was significantly associated with venous invasion, lymphatic invasion, and metastasis. The area under the ROC curve of circ-LDLRAD3 alone or combination with CA19-9 was 0.67 and 0.87, respectively, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.5738 (alone) and 0.7049 (alone), and 0.8033 (combination) and 0.9355 (combination), respectively. CONCLUSION These data suggest that circ-LDLRAD3 may be a biomarker in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. © The Author(s) 2017. Published by baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: High expression of the RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) has previously been described as a favorable clinicopathological factor in several cancers, including ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic implications of RBM3 expression in gastric cancer. Material/Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis of RBM3 expression from 123 patients showed that upregulated RBM3 was mainly found in intestinal-type (n=78, case=59) cancer compared to diffuse-type (n=15, case=8) and mixedtype (n=30, case=17). There were no significant differences in RBM3 expression in subgroups of clinicopathological parameters. RBM3 expression was strongly associated with p53 but not with Ki-67. Cox univariate analysis revealed that high RBM3 expression was closely associated with prolonged overall survival time (HR 0.504, 95% CI: 0.300-0.845, P=0.009). Multivariate analysis remained supporting these associations when adjusted for age, sex, tumor size, differentiation grade, TNM stage, lymphatic invasion, and Ki-67 and p53 expression (HR 0.541, 95% CI: 0.308-0.952, P=0.033), where Lauren grade was not included. Lauren grade was the only factor with independent prognostic significance in a model adjusted for all factors. These results were confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Therefore, together with the upregulated RBM3 expression observed in intestinal-type of Lauren grade, we suggest that upregulation of RBM3 is partially responsible for the favorable overall survival in cases with intestinal Lauren grade, which is demonstrated by the box diagram and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Our results showed that high RBM3 expression in gastric cancer is mainly found in intestinal-type of Lauren grade and is associated with longer overall survival time. Conclusion: We found that RBM3 is a potential biomarker of good prognosis and deserves further validation. © Med Sci Monit, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Metastatic prostate cancer is initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, resistance typically develops in about 1 year – a clinical condition termed metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We develop and investigate a spatial game (agent based continuous space) of mCRPC that considers three distinct cancer cell types: (1) those dependent on exogenous testosterone (T+), (2) those with increased CYP17A expression that produce testosterone and provide it to the environment as a public good (TP), and (3) those independent of testosterone (T−). The interactions within and between cancer cell types can be represented by a 3 × 3 matrix. Based on the known biology of this cancer there are 22 potential matrices that give roughly three major outcomes depending upon the absence (good prognosis), near absence or high frequency (poor prognosis) of T− cells at the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). When just two cell types coexist the spatial game faithfully reproduces the ESS of the corresponding matrix game. With three cell types divergences occur, in some cases just two strategies coexist in the spatial game even as a non-spatial matrix game supports all three. Discrepancies between the spatial game and non-spatial ESS happen because different cell types become more or less clumped in the spatial game – leading to non-random assortative interactions between cell types. Three key spatial scales influence the distribution and abundance of cell types in the spatial game: i. Increasing the radius at which cells interact with each other can lead to higher clumping of each type, ii. Increasing the radius at which cells experience limits to population growth can cause densely packed tumor clusters in space, iii. Increasing the dispersal radius of daughter cells promotes increased mixing of cell types. To our knowledge the effects of these spatial scales on eco-evolutionary dynamics have not been explored in cancer models. The fact that cancer interactions are spatially explicit and that our spatial game of mCRPC provides in general different outcomes than the non-spatial game might suggest that non-spatial models are insufficient for capturing key elements of tumorigenesis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has collected transcriptome, genome and epigenome information for over 20 cancers from thousands of patients. The availability of these diverse data types makes it necessary to combine these data to capture the heterogeneity of biological processes and phenotypes and further identify homogeneous subtypes for cancers such as breast cancer. Many multi-view clustering approaches are proposed to discover clusters across different data types. The problem is challenging when different data types show poor agreement of clustering structure. Results: In this work, we first propose a multi-view clustering approach with consensus (CMC), which tries to find consensus kernels among views by using Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. To tackle the problem when poor agreement among views exists, we further propose a multi-view clustering approach with enhanced consensus (ECMC) to solve this problem by decomposing the kernel information in each view into a consensus part and a disagreement part. The consensus parts for different views are supposed to be similar, and the disagreement parts should be independent with the consensus parts. Both the CMC and ECMC models can be solved by alternative updating with semi-definite programming. Our experiments on both simulation datasets and real-world benchmark datasets show that ECMC model could achieve higher clustering accuracies than other state-of-art multi-view clustering approaches. We also apply the ECMC model to integrate mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression data for five cancer data sets, and the survival analysis show that our ECMC model outperforms other methods when identifying cancer subtypes. By Fisher's combination test method, we found that three computed subtypes roughly correspond to three known breast cancer subtypes including luminal B, HER2 and basal-like subtypes. Conclusion: Integrating heterogeneous TCGA datasets by our proposed multi-view clustering approach ECMC could effectively identify cancer subtypes. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gene expression connectivity mapping has gained much popularity in recent years with a number of successful applications in biomedical research testifying its utility and promise. A major application of connectivity mapping is the identification of small molecule compounds capable of inhibiting a disease state. In this study, we are additionally interested in small molecule compounds that may enhance a disease state or increase the risk of developing that disease. Using breast cancer as a case study, we aim to develop and test a methodology for identifying commonly prescribed drugs that may have a suppressing or inducing effect on the target disease (breast cancer). Results: We obtained from public data repositories a collection of breast cancer gene expression datasets with over 7000 patients. An integrated meta-analysis approach to gene expression connectivity mapping was developed, which involved unified processing and normalization of raw gene expression data, systematic removal of batch effects, and multiple runs of balanced sampling for differential expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes stringently selected were used to construct multiple non-joint gene signatures representing the same biological state. Remarkably these non-joint gene signatures retrieved from connectivity mapping separate lists of candidate drugs with significant overlaps, providing high confidence in their predicted effects on breast cancers. Of particular note, among the top 26 compounds identified as inversely connected to the breast cancer gene signatures, 14 of them are known anti-cancer drugs. Conclusions: A few candidate drugs with potential to enhance breast cancer or increase the risk of the disease were also identified; further investigation on a large population is required to firmly establish their effects on breast cancer risks. This work thus provides a novel approach and an applicable example for identifying medications with potential to alter cancer risks through gene expression connectivity mapping. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a complex disorder resulting from the combined effects of multiple environmental and genetic factors. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), regulate several cellular processes and have an important role in many human malignancies including PCa. We assessed the sRNA profiles associated with PCa in Arabs, a population that has rarely been studied. Methods: We used next generation sequencing technology to obtain the entire sRNA transcriptome of primary prostate tumor formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and their paired non-tumor tissues, collected from Bedouin patients (Qatari and Saudi). The miRNA and the target gene expression were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. miRNA KEGG pathway and miRNA target genes were subsequently analyzed by starBase and TargetScan software. Results: Different expression patterns of several sRNA and miRNA editing were revealed between PCa tumor and their paired non-tumor tissues. Our study identified four miRNAs that are strongly associated with prostate cancer, which have not been reported previously. Differentially expressed miRNAs significantly affect various biological pathways, such as cell cycle, endocytosis, adherence junction and pathways involved in cancer. Prediction of potential targets for the identified miRNAs indicates the overexpression of KRAS, BCL2 and down-regulation of PTEN in PCa tumor tissues. Conclusion: These miRNAs, newly associated with prostate cancer, may represent not only markers for the increased risk of PCa in Arabs, but may also reflect the clinical and pathological diversity as well as the ethno-specific heterogeneity of prostate cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths for women. It is of great necessity to develop effective methods for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Recent studies have focused on gene-based signatures for outcome predictions. Kernel SVM for its discriminative power in dealing with small sample pattern recognition problems has attracted a lot attention. But how to select or construct an appropriate kernel for a specified problem still needs further investigation. Results: Here we propose a novel kernel (Hadamard Kernel) in conjunction with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to address the problem of breast cancer outcome prediction using gene expression data. Hadamard Kernel outperform the classical kernels and correlation kernel in terms of Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) values where a number of real-world data sets are adopted to test the performance of different methods. Conclusions: Hadamard Kernel SVM is effective for breast cancer predictions, either in terms of prognosis or diagnosis. It may benefit patients by guiding therapeutic options. Apart from that, it would be a valuable addition to the current SVM kernel families. We hope it will contribute to the wider biology and related communities. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are easily obtained from routine blood tests. We investigated the associations of the NLR and PLR with the clinical parameters and prognoses of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Methods: Pre-treatment clinical and laboratory data from 139 patients with SCLC were retrospectively studied with univariate analyses. The NLR and PLR values were divided into two separate groups: high NLR (>4.55, n=32) vs low NLR (≤4.55, n=107) and high PLR (>148, n=63) vs low PLR (≤148, n=76). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the effects of NLR and PLR on overall survival. Results: Chi-square analyses revealed significant associations of high NLR with tumour stage, hepatic metastasis, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and significant associations of high PLR with tumour stage, bone and hepatic metastases, exposure to cooking oil fumes, and chemotherapy. Mann-Whitney U tests demonstrated an association of high NLR with smoking exposure, and high NLR and high PLR were correlated with several laboratory parameters. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that high NLR and high PLR conferred poor prognoses for SCLC patients. Moreover, multivariate analysis demonstrated that NLR, tumour stage, and hepatic metastasis were independent prognostic factors for survival. In this study, we found that NLR and PLR were associated with several factors that reflect the inflammatory (white blood cell count, WBC; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) and nutritional (albumin, ALB; haemoglobin, HB; and cholesterol) status of SCLC patients at diagnosis. Conclusions: NLR is an independent prognostic factor and can be used to predict the mortality risk of SCLC patients. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nanohybrids can in most cases kill cancer cells more efficiently as compared with free photosensitizers. In this work, we constructed nanohybrid Ru1@CDs composed of carbon nanodots (CDs) and a phosphorescent Ru(ii) complex (Ru1) for one- and two-photon photodynamic therapy of cancer. The photosensitizer and imaging agent Ru1 is decorated onto the nanocarrier CDs covalently. Ru1 and Ru1@CDs can penetrate into cancer cells through an energy-dependent mechanism and endocytosis, respectively. Both Ru1 and Ru1@CDs are capable of lysosome-targeted phosphorescence imaging and photodamage under either 450 nm (one-photon) or 810 nm (two-photon) excitation. Conjugation with CDs can increase the cellular uptake efficacy of Ru1. Mechanism investigations show that both Ru1 and Ru1@CDs can induce apoptosis through generation of reactive oxygen species and cathepsin-initiated apoptotic signaling pathways. Upon two-photon excitation, Ru1@CDs show better penetrability, as well as higher inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth in both 2D cell and 3D multicellular tumor spheroid models. Our work provides an effective strategy for the construction of multifunctional imaging and phototherapeutic nanohybrids for the treatment of cancer. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: analyze cancer survivors' reports about their communication with health professional team members and describe the similarities and differences in interactional patterns between Brazilian and Canadian health care contexts.METHOD: This study adopted a qualitative health research approach to secondary analysis, using interpretive description as the methodology, allowing us to elaborate a new research question and look at the primary data from a different perspective. There were in total eighteen participants; all of them were adults and elderly diagnosed with urologic cancer. After being organized and read, the data sets were classified into categories, and an analytic process was performed through inductive thematic analysis.RESULTS: This resulted in three categories of findings which we have framed as: Communication between professional and survivor; The symptoms, the doubts, the questions; and Actions and reaction.CONCLUSION: This comparative study allowed us to bring to the attention of health professionals, especially nurses, findings regarding effective communication, humanization and empathy, supporting both inside and outside support groups, giving pieces of advice, and advocating for the survivor as is necessary. The study also showed the importance of self-development of these professionals as they fight for better quality in the health system for their patients.",

    "Abstract": "Nivolumab (Opdivo) approval for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prompts recognition of its future use in various cancers. Although rare, occurring in 1% to 3% of treated cases, nivolumab along with other immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with immune-related encephalitis. With its prospective use, nivolumab-induced encephalitis illustrates the necessity of early recognition and successful management to decrease morbidity and mortality. We describe a treated case of nivolumab-induced encephalitis. A 74-year-old male with a history of stage 4 squamous NSCLC presenting with insidious altered mental status following his first dose of nivolumab. After an extensive workup that proved negative, the patient received intravenous steroids with gradual improvement of mental status. Patient subsequently returned to baseline and was discharged with oral steroid taper. Nivolumab-induced encephalitis is a diagnosis of exclusion with nonspecific signs and symptoms. Immediate recognition of patients prescribed nivolumab chemotherapy could potentially prevent fatal complications of neurotoxicity. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The oncogenic potential of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in breast cancer is being increasingly recognized. Despite some controversies regarding such role, new evidence is suggesting a culpability of EBV in breast cancer, particularly in Africa where the virus has been originally associated with causation of several solid and hematological malignancies. One example is a report from Sudan implicating EBV as a prime etiologic agent for an aggressive type of breast cancer, where nearly 100% of tumor tissues were shown to carry viral signatures. To get a broader view on such association, other nearby countries should be investigated. The present study aims to determine the prevalence and possible associations of the virus in Eritrean breast cancer patients. Methods: Detection of EBV genome using primers that target Epstein Barr Encoded RNA (EBER) gene and Latent Membrane Protein-1 (LMP-1) gene sequences was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA samples extracted from 144 formalin fixed paraffin embedded breast cancer tissues and 63 non-cancerous breast tissue as control group. A subset of PCR positive samples was evaluated for EBER gene expression by in situ hybridization (ISH). Expression of Latent Membrane Protein-2a (LMP2a) was also assessed by immunohistochemistry in a subset of 45 samples. Results: Based on PCR results, EBV genome signals were detected in a total of 40 samples (27.77%) as compared to controls (p-value = 0. 0031) with a higher sensitivity when using the EBER primers. Five out of the 14 samples stained by EBER-ISH 35.71% were positive for the virus indicating the presence of the viral genome within the tumor cells. Of those stained for IHC 7 (15.55%) were positive for LMP2a showing low viral protein frequency. Conclusions: Based on these findings it can be concluded that EBV in Eritrea is associated with a smaller subset of tumors, unlike neighboring Sudan, thus pointing to possible differences in population predisposition and diseases epidemiology. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AIM To study cancer hotspot mutations by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in stool DNA from patients with different gastrointestinal tract (GIT) neoplasms. METHODS Stool samples were collected from 87 Finnish patients diagnosed with various gastric and colorectal neoplasms, including benign tumors, and from 14 healthy controls. DNA was isolated from stools by using the PSP® Spin Stool DNA Plus Kit. For each sample, 20 ng of DNA was used to construct sequencing libraries using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 or Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer panel v2. Sequencing was performed on Ion PGM. Torrent Suite Software v.5.2.2 was used for variant calling and data analysis. RESULTS NGS was successful in assaying 72 GIT samples and 13 healthy controls, with success rates of the assay being 78% for stomach neoplasia and 87% for colorectal tumors. In stool specimens from patients with gastric neoplasia, five hotspot mutations were found in APC , CDKN2A and EGFR genes, in addition to seven novel mutations. From colorectal patients, 20 mutations were detected in AKT1 , APC , ERBB2 , FBXW7 , KIT , KRAS , NRAS , SMARCB1 , SMO , STK11 and TP53 . Healthy controls did not exhibit any hotspot mutations, except for two novel ones. APC and TP53 were the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal neoplasms, with five mutations, followed by KRAS with two mutations. APC was the most commonly mutated gene in stools of patients with premalignant/benign GIT lesions. CONCLUSION Our results show that in addition to colorectal neoplasms, mutations can also be assayed from stool specimens of patients with gastric neoplasms. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Background: Malignant tumors are typically caused by a conglomeration of genomic aberrations - including point mutations, small insertions, small deletions, and large copy-number variations. In some cases, specific chemotherapies and targeted drug treatments are effective against tumors that harbor certain genomic aberrations. However, predictive aberrations (biomarkers) have not been identified for many tumor types and treatments. One way to address this problem is to examine the downstream, transcriptional effects of genomic aberrations and to identify characteristic patterns. Even though two tumors harbor different genomic aberrations, the transcriptional effects of those aberrations may be similar. These patterns could be used to inform treatment choices. Methods: We used data from 9300 tumors across 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We used supervised machine learning to evaluate our ability to distinguish between tumors that had mutually exclusive genomic aberrations in specific genes. An ability to accurately distinguish between tumors with aberrations in these genes suggested that the genes have a relatively different downstream effect on transcription, and vice versa. We compared these findings against prior knowledge about signaling networks and drug responses. Results: Our analysis recapitulates known relationships in cancer pathways and identifies gene pairs known to predict responses to the same treatments. For example, in lung adenocarcinomas, gene-expression profiles from tumors with somatic aberrations in EGFR or MET were negatively correlated with each other, in line with prior knowledge that MET amplification causes resistance to EGFR inhibition. In breast carcinomas, we observed high similarity between PTEN and PIK3CA, which play complementary roles in regulating cellular proliferation. In a pan-cancer analysis, we found that genomic aberrations in BRAF and VHL exhibit downstream effects that are clearly distinct from other genes. Conclusion: We show that transcriptional data offer promise as a way to group genomic aberrations according to their downstream effects, and these groupings recapitulate known relationships. Our approach shows potential to help pharmacologists and clinical trialists narrow the search space for candidate gene/drug associations, including for rare mutations, and for identifying potential drug-repurposing opportunities. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an emerging, whole body biomedical imaging technique, with sub-millimeter spatial resolution and high sensitivity to a biocompatible contrast agent consisting of an iron oxide nanoparticle core and a biofunctionalized shell. Successful application of MPI for imaging of cancer depends on the nanoparticles (NPs) accumulating at tumors at sufficient levels relative to other sites. NPs' physiochemical properties such as size, crystallographic structure and uniformity, surface coating, stability, blood circulation time and magnetization determine the efficacy of their tumor accumulation and MPI signal generation. Here, we address these criteria by presenting strategies for the synthesis and surface functionalization of efficient MPI tracers, that can target a typical murine brain cancer model and generate three dimensional images of these tumors with very high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Our results showed high contrast agent sensitivities that enabled us to detect 1.1 ng of iron (SNR ∼ 3.9) and enhance the spatial resolution to about 600 μm. The biodistribution of these NPs was also studied using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. NPs were mainly accumulated in the liver and spleen and did not show any renal clearance. This first pre-clinical study of cancer targeted NPs imaged using a tomographic MPI system in an animal model paves the way to explore new nanomedicine strategies for cancer diagnosis and therapy, using clinically safe magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and MPI. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "This pivotal phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). After a median observation period of approximately 6 years from first treatment, we examined the durability of remission, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety outcomes of patients treated on this trial. Among all enrolled patients (n558), no progressions were observed beyond 40months, and median OS was not reached. Patients with a complete response (CR), as assessed by the investigator (38 of 58, 66%), continued to demonstrate improved outcomes with neither median OS nor PFS reached. Of the 38 CR patients, 16 received a consolidative stem cell transplant (SCT) with median PFS not reached. Among patients who were on-study and in remission at study closure, 16 patients had not received any new treatment after single-Agent brentuximab vedotin other than consolidative SCT. Among this subset of 16 patients, 8 received SCT, and the remaining 8 patients(14% of all enrolledpatients)remained in sustained remissionwithoutconsolidative SCT or any new anticancer therapy. Thirty-Three patients experienced peripheral neuropathy, among whom, the majority (30 of 33, 91%) had experienced resolution or improvement at their last assessment. These final results, which demonstrated a high rate of peripheral neuropathy resolution, and durable remissions in a subset of patients with relapsed or refractory systemic ALCL, provide evidence that single-Agent brentuximab vedotin may be a potentially curative treatment option. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",

    "Abstract": "Background: 68Ga-labelled prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand PET/CT is a promising modality in primary staging (PS) and biochemical relapse (BCR) of prostate cancer (PC). However, pelvic nodes or local recurrences can be difficult to differentiate from radioactive urine. CT urography (CT-U) is an established method, which allows assessment of urological malignancies. The study presents a novel protocol of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-U in PS and BCR of PC. Methods: A retrospective review of PSMA PET/CT-U preformed on 57 consecutive patients with prostate cancer. Fifty mL of IV contrast was administered 10 min (range 8-15) before the CT component of a combined PET/CT study, acquired approximately 60 min (range 40-85) after administration of 166 MBq (range 91-246) of 68Ga-PSMA-11. PET and PET/CT-U were reviewed by two nuclear medicine physicians and CT-U by a radiologist. First, PET images were reviewed independently followed by PET/CT-U images. Foci of activity which could not unequivocally be assessed as disease or urinary activity were recorded. PET/CT-U was considered of potential benefit in final interpretation when the equivocal focal activity in PET images corresponded to opacified ureter, bladder, prostate bed, seminal vesicles, or urethra. Student's T test and Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for assessment of variables including lymph node size and standardized uptake value. Results: Overall 50 PSMA PET/CT-U studies were performed for BCR and 7 for PS. Median PSA with BCR and PS were 2.0 ± 11.4 ng/ml (0.06-57.3 ng/ml) and 18 ± 35.3 ng/ml (6.8-100 ng/ml), respectively. The median Gleason-score for both groups was 7 (range 6-10). In BCR group, PSMA PET was reported positive in 36 (72%) patients, CT-U in 11(22%) patients and PET/CT-U in 33 (66%) patients. In PS group, PSMA PET detected the primary site in all seven patients, of which one patient with metastatic nodal disease had negative CT finding. Of 40 equivocal foci (27/57 patients) on PET, 11 foci (10/57 patients, 17.5%) were localized to enhanced urine on PET/CT-U, hence considered of potential benefit in interpretation. Of those, 3 foci (3 patients) were solitary sites of activity on PSMA imaging including two local and one nodal site and 4 foci (3 patients) were in different nodal fields. Conclusions: PET/CT-U protocol is a practical approach and may assist in interpretation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 imaging by delineation of the contrast opacified genitourinary system and matching focal PSMA activity with urinary contrast. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of a novel dendritic cell (DC) vaccine pulsed with survivin and MUC1, silenced with suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), and immune stimulated with flagellin for patients with stage I to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a phase I open-label, uncontrolled, and dose-escalation trial. Moreover, we evaluate the potential efficacy of this modified DC vaccine as secondary aim. Methods: The patients were treated with the vaccine at 1×10 6 , 1×10 7 and the maximum dose 8×10 7 at day 7, 14, and 21 after characterization of the vaccine phenotype by flow cytometry. The safety of the vaccine was assessed by adverse events, and the efficacy by the levels of several specific tumor markers and the patient quality of life. Results: The vaccine was well tolerated without dose-limiting toxicity even at higher doses. The most common adverse event reported was just grade 1 flu-like symptoms without unanticipated or serious adverse event. A significant decrease in CD3+CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cell number and increase in TNF-α and IL-6 were observed in two patients. Two patients showed 15% and 64% decrease in carcino-embryonic antigen and CYFRA21, respectively. The vaccination with the maximum dose significantly improved the patients'quality of life when administered at the highest dose. More importantly, in the long-term follow-up until February 17, 2017, 1 patient had no recurrence, 1 patients had a progressive disease (PD), and 1 patient was died in the low dose group. In the middle dose group, all 3 patients had no recurrence. In the high dose group, 1 patient was died, 1 patient had a PD, and the other 7 patients had no recurrence. Conclusions: We provide preliminary data on the safety and efficacy profile of a novel vaccine against non-small cell lung cancer, which was reasonably well tolerated, induced modest antitumor activity without dose-limiting toxicity, and improved patients' quality of life. Further more, the vaccine maybe a very efficacious treatment for patients with resected NSCLC to prevent recurrence. Our findings on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this phase I trial warrant future phase II/III clinical trial. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metastasis depends upon cancer cell growth and survival within the metastatic niche. Tumors which remodel their glycocalyces, by overexpressing bulky glycoproteins like mucins, exhibit a higher predisposition to metastasize, but the role of mucins in oncogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we report that a bulky glycocalyx promotes the expansion of disseminated tumor cells in vivo by fostering integrin adhesion assembly to permit G1 cell cycle progression. We engineered tumor cells to display glycocalyces of various thicknesses by coating them with synthetic mucin-mimetic glycopolymers. Cells adorned with longer glycopolymers showed increased metastatic potential, enhanced cell cycle progression, and greater levels of integrin-FAK mechanosignaling and Akt signaling in a syngeneic mouse model of metastasis. These effects were mirrored by expression of the ectodomain of cancer-associated mucin MUC1. These findings functionally link mucinous proteins with tumor aggression, and offer a new view of the cancer glycocalyx as a major driver of disease progression. © Woods et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Ultrasonography (US) is recommended as a standard surveillance tool for patients with a high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the low sensitivity of US for small HCC can lead to surveillance failure, resulting in advanced stage tumor presentations. For the early detection of HCC in high-risk patients and to improve survival and prognosis, a new efficient imaging tool with a high sensitivity for HCC detection is needed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the feasibility and efficacy of non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with US as a surveillance tool for HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: MAGNUS-HCC is a prospective, multicenter clinical trial with a crossover design for a single arm of patients. This study was approved by six Institutional Review Boards, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. All patients will undergo liver US every 6months and non-contrast liver MRI every 12months during a follow-up period of 3years. If a focal liver lesion suspected of harboring HCC is detected, dynamic liver computed tomography (CT) will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. After the last surveillance round, patients without suspicion of HCC or who are not diagnosed with HCC will be evaluated with a dynamic liver CT to exclude false-negative findings. The primary endpoint is to compare the rate of detection of HCC by US examinations performed at 6-month intervals with that of yearly non-contrast liver MRI studies during a 3-year follow-up. The secondary endpoint is the survival of the patients who developed HCC within the 3-year follow-up period. Discussion: MAGNUS-HCC is the first study to compare the feasibility of non-contrast MRI with US as a surveillance tool for the detection of HCC in high-risk patients. We anticipate that the evidence presented in this study will establish the efficacy of non-contrast MRI as a surveillance tool for HCC in high-risk patients. Trial registration: The date of trial registration ( NCT02551250 ) in this study was September 15, 2015, and follow-up is still ongoing. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are associated with poor survival in metastatic cancer. Their identification, phenotyping, and genotyping could lead to a better understanding of tumor heterogeneity and thus facilitate the selection of patients for personalized treatment. However, this is hampered because of the rarity of CTCs. We present an innovative approach for sampling a high volume of the patient blood and obtaining information about presence, phenotype, and gene translocation of CTCs. The method combines immunofluorescence staining and DNA fluorescent-in-situ-hybridization (DNA FISH) and is based on a functionalized medical wire. This wire is an innovative device that permits the in vivo isolation of CTCs from a large volume of peripheral blood. The blood volume screened by a 30-min administration of the wire is approximately 1.5-3 L. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression and the chromosomal translocation of the ALK gene were determined in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines captured by the functionalized wire and stained with an immuno-DNA FISH approach. Our main challenge was to perform the assay on a 3D structure, the functionalized wire, and to determine immuno-phenotype and FISH signals on this support using a conventional fluorescence microscope. The results obtained indicate that catching CTCs and analyzing their phenotype and chromosomal rearrangement could potentially represent a new companion diagnostic approach and provide an innovative strategy for improving personalized cancer treatments. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

    "Abstract": "Background: Chlorella vulgaris (ChV), a unicellular green algae has been reported to have anticancer and antioxidant effects. The aim of this study was to determine the chemopreventive effect of ChV on liver cancer induced rats by determining the level and expression of several liver tumour markers. Methods: Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were divided into 4 groups according to the diet given: control group (normal diet), ChV group with three different doses (50, 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight), liver cancer- induced group (choline deficient diet + 0.1% ethionine in drinking water or CDE group), and the treatment group (CDE group treated with three different doses of ChV). Rats were killed at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of experiment and blood and tissue samples were taken from all groups for the determination of tumour markers expression alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) and specific antigen for oval cells (OV-6). Results: Serum level of TGF-β increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in CDE rats. However, ChV at all doses managed to decrease (p &lt; 0.05) its levels to control values. Expressions of liver tumour markers AFP, TGF-β, M2-PK and OV-6 were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in tissues of CDE rats when compared to control showing an increased number of cancer cells during hepatocarcinogenesis. ChV at all doses reduced their expressions significantly (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions:Chlorella vulgaris has chemopreventive effect by downregulating the expression of tumour markers M2-PK, OV-6, AFP and TGF-β, in HCC-induced rats. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: In recent years, the integration of 'omics' technologies, high performance computation, and mathematical modeling of biological processes marks that the systems biology has started to fundamentally impact the way of approaching drug discovery. The LINCS public data warehouse provides detailed information about cell responses with various genetic and environmental stressors. It can be greatly helpful in developing new drugs and therapeutics, as well as improving the situations of lacking effective drugs, drug resistance and relapse in cancer therapies, etc. Results: In this study, we developed a Ternary status based Integer Linear Programming (TILP) method to infer cell-specific signaling pathway network and predict compounds' treatment efficacy. The novelty of our study is that phosphor-proteomic data and prior knowledge are combined for modeling and optimizing the signaling network. To test the power of our approach, a generic pathway network was constructed for a human breast cancer cell line MCF7; and the TILP model was used to infer MCF7-specific pathways with a set of phosphor-proteomic data collected from ten representative small molecule chemical compounds (most of them were studied in breast cancer treatment). Cross-validation indicated that the MCF7-specific pathway network inferred by TILP were reliable predicting a compound's efficacy. Finally, we applied TILP to re-optimize the inferred cell-specific pathways and predict the outcomes of five small compounds (carmustine, doxorubicin, GW-8510, daunorubicin, and verapamil), which were rarely used in clinic for breast cancer. In the simulation, the proposed approach facilitates us to identify a compound's treatment efficacy qualitatively and quantitatively, and the cross validation analysis indicated good accuracy in predicting effects of five compounds. Conclusions: In summary, the TILP model is useful for discovering new drugs for clinic use, and also elucidating the potential mechanisms of a compound to targets. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prostate is susceptible to infection and pro-inflammatory agents in a man's whole life. Chronic inflammation might play important roles in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are often recruited to the tumor microenvironment due to local inflammation. We have asked whether stimulation of MSCs by pro-inflammatory cytokines could promote prostate tumor growth. The current study investigated the possible involvement of MSCs stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines in promotion and angiogenesis of prostate cancer through relative pathway in vitro and in vivo. Methods: A syngeneic mouse model of C57 was established. The murine prostate cancer cells (RM-1) mixing with MSCs treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or vehicle were subcutaneously injected into C57 mice. Tumor volume of C57 mouse model was estimated and serum level of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was test by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). A hen egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) assay was applied to test the effect of conditioned media of stimulated MSCs in chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) knocked down either hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) or nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) were employed. mRNA of PDGF and VEGF in MSCs, as well as NRF2 and HIF-1α was test by Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Protein expression levels of PDGF and VEGF from conditioned medium, NRF2, HIF-1α, as well as PDGF and VEGF in MSCs were detected by Western blot analysis. Results: MSCs treated with TNF-α and IFN-γ promote tumor growth in C57 syngeneic mouse model, correlating with increased serum level of PDGF, VEGF. HET-CAM assay shows the angiogenic effect of conditioned medium of MSCs pre-treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines. mRNA and protein levels of two pro-angiogenic factors (PDGF and VEGF) and key hypoxia regulators (HIF-1α and NRF2) in MSCs were induced after MSCs' pretreatment. siRNA knockdown either HIF-1α or NRF2 results reduction of PDGF and VEGF expression. Conclusions: MSCs stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines increase the expression of PDGF and VEGF via the NRF2-HIF-1α pathway and accelerate prostate cancer growth in mice. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: to determine the quality of life and anxiety in patients with breast cancer and the changes they experience after treatments.METHOD: prospective study. Breast cancer statistics (n=339, confidence=95%, accuracy= ± 5.32%). The quality of life questionnaires (QLQ) used were QLQ C-30 and QLQ Br23, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used for anxiety. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with baseline quality of life and anxiety as well as pre- and post-treatment differences. Authorization was obtained from the Ethics Committee, and informed consent was provided by all patients.RESULTS: the baseline quality of life dimensions with the lowest score were future prospects (46.0/100) and sexual enjoyment (55.7/100). The dimensions with the highest score were body image (94.2/100) and role (93.3/100). The most disturbing symptoms were insomnia, fatigue and concern about hair loss. After treatment, the dimensions of physical function, role, body image, financial concerns and symptomatology worsened, whereas emotional function and future prospects improved. Severe anxiety presented as a state (48.6%) and as a trait (18.2%). The highest baseline state anxiety was associated with married-widowed status and anxiolytic medication. The greatest trait anxiety was associated with an inactive work situation, anxiolytic medication, breast swelling and advanced stage at diagnosis. After treatment, anxiety significantly decreased.CONCLUSIONS: After treatment, the quality of life score was positively modified, while state and trait anxiety decreased.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To assess the predictive value of the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in terms of the clinical outcomes of patients with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms after radical surgery. METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from 142 patients who were diagnosed with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms and who underwent radical gastrectomy at our department from March 2006 to March 2015. These data were retrospectively analyzed, and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to identify the optimal value of the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were used to identify prognostic factors. A nomogram was then applied to predict clinical outcomes after surgery. RESULTS The tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly associated with tumor recurrence, especially with liver metastasis and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05 for both), but not with clinical characteristics (P > 0.05 for all). A multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival and overall survival (P < 0.05 for both). The concordance index of the nomograms, which included the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Ki-67 index, and lymph node ratio, was 0.788 (0.759) for recurrence-free survival (overall survival) and was higher than the concordance index of the traditional TNM staging system [0.672 (0.663)]. CONCLUSION The tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms. Nomograms that include the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Ki-67 index, and lymph node ratio have a superior ability to predict clinical outcomes of postoperative patients.",

    "Abstract": "Recently, immunochromatography test strips (ICTS) have been fully developed for point-of-care testing (POCT). However, the intrinsic limitations including non-quantitative detection of colloidal gold ICTS and low sensitivity of fluorescence ICTS (FICTS) significantly restrict their further application in clinical diagnosis. Taking advantages of rapid colorimetric qualitative detection and fluorescence quantitation, we designed a kind of sensitive and dual-mode magnetic FICTS (mFICTS) based on PLGA@Fe3O4 super-paramagnetic nanosphere (SPMN) probes quenching multiplex fluorescer on the test line through sandwich immunoreactions. Owing to the large number of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (about 47) encapsulated in one SPMN, about 2680 Cy5 molecules were quenched by one SPMN on the test line such that to significantly improve the analytical sensitivity as well as the detection of whole blood samples via magnetic separation. Moreover, the aggregation of black SPMN on the test line enabled a quick naked-eye screening in 3 min. For high accuracy breast cancer diagnosis, combined determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA153) was performed on one mFICTS with the limits of detection of about 0.06 ng mL -1 and 0.09 U mL -1 , respectively. Then, more than 50 clinical serum samples were investigated for high-resolution screening by mFICTS, and the results were coincident with those obtained by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Thus, the designed mFICTS is suitable for point-of-care diagnostics. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, water-soluble PEG-modified Sr 2 YbF 7 :Tm 3+ was prepared conveniently by a one-pot solvothermal method, where the molar ratio of Sr 2+ to Yb 3+ was controlled between 3:2 and 1:1. The optimum red-light emission at 677-699 nm was modulated via 0.7% Tm 3+ doped under irradiation at 980 nm. Interestingly, biological experimental results showed that the PEG-modified Sr 2 YbF 7 :Tm 3+ with low toxicity, excellent cell membrane permeability and high photostability can not only distinguish HeLa cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts but also target the subcellular organelle lysosome in HeLa cells; therefore it can be anticipated that the as-prepared material would be a potential tool for cancer diagnosis. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a promising biomarker for monitoring cancer metastasis and therapy response. However, the rarity and inherent fragility of CTCs pose great challenges for CTC detection. Currently, CTC detection requires advanced instruments that might be inaccessible in most hospitals or labs. To allow simple and rapid CTC detection, we propose a sensor platform that relies only on the intrinsic properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) including rapid separation as well as nanozyme activity. The detection of melanoma CTC, which causes most skin cancer-related deaths, is demonstrated based on bifunctional MNPs. The magnetic property of MNPs enables melanoma CTC isolation and enrichment within 5 min from blood. The nanozyme activity of MNPs allows naked-eye detection of melanoma CTC by catalyzing the oxidation of colourless 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into blue coloured products. Melanoma CTC enumeration can be further achieved by UV-vis measurement. Our platform has successfully detected 13 melanoma CTCs per mL within 50 min. We thus believe this platform could find broad applications both in the clinic and in research. © This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in women worldwide. However, screening with human papillomavirus (HPV) molecular tests holds promise for reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. The performance of the Abbott RealTime High-Risk HPV test (AbRT) was evaluated in 83 cervical smear specimens and compared with a conventional nested PCR coupled to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to identify the amplicons. Results: The AbRT assay detected at least one HPV genotype in 44.57% of women regardless of the grade of cervical abnormalities. Except for one case, good concordance was observed for the genotypes detected with the AbRT assay in the high-risk HPV category determined with HTS of the amplicon generated by conventional nested PCR. Conclusions: The AbRT test is an easy and reliable molecular tool and was as sensitive as conventional nested PCR in cervical smear specimens for detection HPVs associated with high-grade lesions. Moreover, sequencing amplicons using an HTS approach effectively identified the genotype of the hrHPV identified with the AbRT test. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Because glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins and because changes in glycosylation have been shown to have a significant correlation with the development of many cancer types, we investigated the serum N-glycome used to diagnose, stage and evaluate the pathological outcomes in IgD multiple myeloma. Methods: Serum samples were available for 20 patients with IgD multiple myeloma, 41 patients with light chain multiple myeloma and 42 healthy control subjects. Serum N-glycans were released and analysed using DNA sequencer-assisted fluorophore-assisted capillary electrophoresis. Results: Characteristic changes were revealed in the serum N-glycome of IgD myeloma. In particular, three N-glycans (NG1(6)A2F, Peak3; NG1(3)A2F, Peak4; NA2FB, Peak7) showed increased clinical value. The best area under the ROC curve of NG1(6)A2F to diagnose IgD myeloma was 0.981, with a 95.0% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity, and that of NG1(3)A2F was 0.936, with a 95.0% sensitivity and 78.6% specificity. The best area under the ROC curve of NA2FB/NG1(3)A2F to differentially diagnose IgD myeloma versus light chain myeloma was 0.744, with a 95.3% sensitivity and 50.0% specificity. The level of NG1(3)A2F was correlated with the international staging system, while the higher abundance of NA2FB presented in IgD myeloma was predictive of a shorter progression-free survival. Conclusions: The advent of serum N-glycan signatures may play a role in the diagnosis, staging and prognosis of IgD myeloma and will serve as the foundation for a precision medicine approach to this rare subtype of multiple myeloma. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) constitute approximately 3% of pancreatic neoplasms. Like patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), some of these patients present with “borderline resectable disease.” For these patients, an optimal treatment approach is lacking. We report our institution’s experience with borderline resectable PanNETs using multimodality treatment. Methods: We identified patients with borderline resectable PanNETs who had received neoadjuvant therapy at our institution between 2000 and 2013. The definition of borderline resectability was based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for PDAC. Neoadjuvant regimen, radiographic response, pathologic response, surgical margins, nodal retrieval, number of positive nodes, and recurrence were documented. Statistics were descriptive. Results: Of 112 patients who underwent surgical resection for PanNETs during the study period, 23 received neoadjuvant therapy, 6 of whom met all inclusion criteria and had borderline resectable disease. These 6 patients received at least 1 cycle of temozolomide and capecitabine, with 3 also receiving radiation. All had radiographic evidence of treatment response. Four (67%) had negative-margin resections. Four patients had histologic evidence of a moderate response. Follow-up (3.0-4.3 years) indicated that all patients were alive, with 5/6 free of disease (1 patient with metastatic disease still on treatment without progression). Conclusions: A multimodality treatment strategy (neoadjuvant temozolomide and capecitabine ± radiation) can be successfully applied to patients with PanNETs who meet NCCN borderline resectable criteria for PDAC. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of a multimodality protocol in the treatment of patients with borderline resectable PanNETs. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, a catalytic synthesis of 2-methylene selanyl-4-chromanols has been described. The manuscript highlights a facile Trimethylsulphoxonium iodide (TMSOI) catalysed intramolecular 6-exo-trig coupling reaction in metal-free environment. The reaction exhibits satisfactory yields in presence of multiple free -hydroxyl groups. A stereoselective generation of syn-3-hex-yne-1,5diols has been explored. The relative stereochemistry has been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray of crystalline-selanyl-chromanols. To determine the anticancer efficacy of the synthesized compounds, cell viability assay using MTT was performed against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Notably, Compound 9j (IC50 = 3.157 μmol) was found to exhibit potent cytotoxic activity. Compounds 9a and 9e also showed activity with IC50 values of 31.60 ± 4.012 and 36.797 ± 2.72 μmol respectively highlighting the potential of the synthesized compounds as novel lead molecules for future development of potent anti-cancer therapeutics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) is highly desired to improve the cancer phototherapeutic effect. However, most reported multicomponent therapeutic agents need complex preparation processes and must be excited by using multiple light sources. Herein, triphenylamine flanked furan-diketopyrrolopyrrole (FDPP-TPA) with a donor-acceptor-donor structure has been synthesized and used as a sole-component agent for fluorescence, photoacoustic and photothermal imaging guided photodynamic and photothermal synergistic therapy. FDPP-TPA nanoparticles (NPs) obtained by re-precipitation exhibit a high molar extinction coefficient (ϵ = 2.13 (±0.2) × 104 M-1 cm-1), excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 47%) and favorable singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ(X) = 40%). In vitro, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is 13 μg mL-1 determined by cytotoxicity assay. And the apoptosis rate is 67.3% according to flow cytometry analysis. In vivo, the tumor can be completely ablated without recurrence, which suggests that FDPP-TPA NPs can generate considerable poisonous singlet oxygen and hyperthermia for tumor treatment. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, energy levels, and growth factors. It contains the atypical kinase mTOR and the RAPTOR subunit that binds to the Tor signalling sequence (TOS) motif of substrates and regulators. mTORC1 is activated by the small GTPase RHEB (Ras homologue enriched in brain) and inhibited by PRAS40. Here we present the 3.0 ångström cryo-electron microscopy structure of mTORC1 and the 3.4 ångström structure of activated RHEB-mTORC1. RHEB binds to mTOR distally from the kinase active site, yet causes a global conformational change that allosterically realigns active-site residues, accelerating catalysis. Cancer-associated hyperactivating mutations map to structural elements that maintain the inactive state, and we provide biochemical evidence that they mimic RHEB relieving auto-inhibition. We also present crystal structures of RAPTOR-TOS motif complexes that define the determinants of TOS recognition, of an mTOR FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain-substrate complex that establishes a second substrate-recruitment mechanism, and of a truncated mTOR-PRAS40 complex that reveals PRAS40 inhibits both substrate-recruitment sites. These findings help explain how mTORC1 selects its substrates, how its kinase activity is controlled, and how it is activated by cancer-associated mutations. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

    "Abstract": "USP7 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a pivotal role in multiple oncogenic pathways and therefore is a desirable target for new anti-cancer therapies. However, the lack of structural information about the USP7-inhibitor interactions has been a critical gap in the development of potent inhibitors. USP7 is unique among USPs in that its active site is catalytically incompetent, and is postulated to rearrange into a productive conformation only upon binding to ubiquitin. Surprisingly, we found that ubiquitin alone does not induce an active conformation in solution. Using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, computational modeling, and cell-based assays, we found that DUB inhibitors P22077 and P50429 covalently modify the catalytic cysteine of USP7 and induce a conformational switch in the enzyme associated with active site rearrangement. This work represents the first experimental insights into USP7 activation and inhibition and provides a structural basis for rational development of potent anti-cancer therapeutics. Pozhidaeva et al. combine biophysical and biological methods to reveal the mechanism of action of two selective inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzyme USP7, and show that the compounds covalently and irreversibly modify the catalytic cysteine of the enzyme through distinct chemical reactions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "AIM To examine the association between white opaque substance (WOS) and histologically verified lipid droplets in colorectal epithelial neoplasms. METHODS We reviewed colonoscopy records at our institution from 2014 to 2016 and identified cases of endoscopically or surgically resected colorectal epithelial neoplasms observed by magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) colonoscopy. Immunohistochemistry was used to stain tumors with a monoclonal antibody specific to adipophilin as a marker of lipids. The expression and distribution of adipophilin were compared between WOS-positive and WOS-negative lesions and among tumors classified by histologic type and depth of invasion. RESULTS Under M-NBI colonoscopy, 81 lesions were positive for WOS and 48 lesions were negative for WOS. The rate of adipophilin expression was significantly higher in WOS-positive lesions (95.1%) than in WOS-negative lesions (68.7%) (P = 0.0001). The incidence of deep adipophilin expression was higher in WOS-positive lesions (24.7%) than in WOS-negative lesions (4.2%) (P = 0.001). The incidence of deep expression was predominant among cancers with massive submucosal invasion (62.5%) compared to adenoma (7.2%) and high-grade dysplasia or cancers with slight submucosal invasion (12.7%) (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION The distribution of lipid droplets may be closely associated with the visibility of WOS under M-NBI colonoscopy, and with histologic grade and depth of tumor invasion. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Fucosylation is a glycan modification critically involved in cancer and inflammation. Although potent fucosylation inhibitors are useful for basic and clinical research, only a few inhibitors have been developed. Here, we focus on a fucose analog with an alkyne group, 6-alkynyl-fucose (6-Alk-Fuc), which is used widely as a detection probe for fucosylated glycans, but is also suggested for use as a fucosylation inhibitor. Our glycan analysis using lectin and mass spectrometry demonstrated that 6-Alk-Fuc is a potent and general inhibitor of cellular fucosylation, with much higher potency than the existing inhibitor, 2-fluoro-fucose (2-F-Fuc). The action mechanism was shown to deplete cellular GDP-Fuc, and the direct target of 6-Alk-Fuc is FX (encoded by TSTA3), the bifunctional GDP-Fuc synthase. We also show that 6-Alk-Fuc halts hepatoma invasion. These results highlight the unappreciated role of 6-Alk-Fuc as a fucosylation inhibitor and its potential use for basic and clinical science. Fucose sugar is involved in cancer and inflammation. Kizuka et al. found that a fucose alkyne strongly inhibits cellular fucosylation. The compound selectively inhibits GDP-fucose synthetase FX and can be applied to glycan-related diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Adoptively transferred T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells depend on host-derived costimulation and cytokine signals for their full and sustained activation. However, in patients with cancer, both signals are frequently impaired. Hence, we developed a novel strategy that combines both essential signals in 1 transgene by expressing the nonlymphoid hematopoietic growth factor receptor c-MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia), the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO), in T cells. c-MPL signaling activates pathways shared with conventional costimulatory and cytokine receptor signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that host-derived TPO, present in the tumor microenvironment, or pharmacological c-MPL agonists approved by the US Food and Drug Administration could deliver both signals to c-MPL-engineered TCR-Transgenic T cells. We found that c-MPL1 polyclonal T cells expand and proliferate in response to TPO, and persist longer after adoptive transfer in immunodeficient human TPO-Transgenic mice. In TCR-Transgenic T cells, c-MPL activation enhances antitumor function, T-cell expansion, and cytokine production and preserves a central memory phenotype. c-MPL signaling also enables sequential tumor cell killing, enhances the formation of effective immune synapses, and improves antileukemic activity in vivo in a leukemia xenograft model. We identify the type 1 interferon pathway as a molecular mechanism by which c-MPL mediates immune stimulation in T cells. In conclusion, we present a novel immunotherapeutic strategy using c-MPL-enhanced transgenic T cells responding to either endogenously produced TPO (a microenvironment factor in hematologic malignancies) or c-MPL-Targeted pharmacological agents. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",

    "Abstract": "The efficient purification and analysis of topological DNA variants is mandatory for many state-of-The-Art molecular medicine technologies, like gene-and cancer-Therapy as well as plasmid vaccination. In this work, we exploit dielectrophoresis (DEP) for a fast and efficient continuous-flow separation and analysis that goes beyond the standard methods of gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis. The aim of this work was to reach for the limits in dielectrophoretic analysis of DNA regarding the size resolution and the topological conformation. A continuous-flow analytical separation of analyte mixtures of small linear DNA-fragments (10.0 kbp, 8.0 kbp, 6.0 kbp, and 5.0 kbp) and topological DNA variants (linear and supercoiled conformation) was investigated. We present a world record in the minimal size difference of 16.7% of DNA samples that can be resolved in a dielectrophoretic continuous-flow separation. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time a microfluidic continuous-flow separation of DNA molecules based on their topological conformation. Since dielectrophoresis is virtually label-free, it offers a fast in-process quality control with low consumption, e.g. for the production of gene vaccines. © This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Glioblastoma multiformae (GBM) is the most aggressive type of malignant brain tumor with complex molecular profile. Overexpression of Na+/H+ Exchanger isoform 9 (NHE9) promotes tumor progression and correlates positively with insensitivity to radiochemotherapy and poor prognosis. However, molecular mechanisms responsible for increase in NHE9 levels beyond a critical threshold have not been identified. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assays, real-time PCR and western blotting were conducted to examine the expression profiles and identify microRNAs (miRNA) that target NHE9. Cell proliferation and migration assays were conducted in U87 glioblastoma cells to determine the consequence of miRNA mediated targeting of NHE9. Endosomal pH measurements, immunofluorescence microscopy and surface biotinylation experiments were conducted to characterize the mechanistic basis of regulation. Results: We show that microRNA 135a (miR-135a) targets NHE9 to downregulate its expression in U87 cells. MiR-135a levels are significantly lower in glioblastoma cells compared to normal brain tissue. Downregulation of NHE9 expression by miR-135a affects proliferative and migratory capacity of U87 cells. Selectively increasing NHE9 expression in these cells restored their ability to proliferate and migrate. We demonstrate that miR-135a takes a two-pronged approach affecting epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) to suppress tumor cell growth and migration. EGFR activity is a potent stimulator of oncogenic signaling. While miR-135a targets EGFR transcripts to decrease the total number of receptors made, by targeting NHE9 it routes the few EGFRs made away from the plasma membrane to dampen oncogenic signaling. NHE9 is localized to sorting endosomes in glioblastoma cells where it alkalinizes the endosome lumen by leaking protons. Downregulation of NHE9 expression by miR-135a acidifies sorting endosomes limiting EGFR trafficking to the glioblastoma cell membrane. Conclusions: We propose downregulation of miR-135a as a potential mechanism underlying the high NHE9 expression observed in subset of glioblastomas. Future studies should explore miR-135a as a potential therapeutic for glioblastomas with NHE9 overexpression. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Normalization is an important data preparation step in gene expression analyses, designed to remove various systematic noise. Sample variance is greatly reduced after normalization, hence the power of subsequent statistical analyses is likely to increase. On the other hand, variance reduction is made possible by borrowing information across all genes, including differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and outliers, which will inevitably introduce some bias. This bias typically inflates type I error and can reduce statistical power in certain situations. In this study we propose a new differential expression analysis pipeline, dubbed as super-delta, that consists of a multivariate extension of the global normalization and a modified t-test. A robust procedure is designed to minimize the bias introduced by DEGs in the normalization step. The modified t-test is derived based on asymptotic theory for hypothesis testing that suitably pairs with the proposed robust normalization. Results: We first compared super-delta with four commonly used normalization methods: global, median-IQR, quantile, and cyclic loess normalization in simulation studies. Super-delta was shown to have better statistical power with tighter control of type I error rate than its competitors. In many cases, the performance of super-delta is close to that of an oracle test in which datasets without technical noise were used. We then applied all methods to a collection of gene expression datasets on breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. While there is a substantial overlap of the DEGs identified by all of them, super-delta were able to identify comparatively more DEGs than its competitors. Downstream gene set enrichment analysis confirmed that all these methods selected largely consistent pathways. Detailed investigations on the relatively small differences showed that pathways identified by super-delta have better connections to breast cancer than other methods. Conclusions: As a new pipeline, super-delta provides new insights to the area of differential gene expression analysis. Solid theoretical foundation supports its asymptotic unbiasedness and technical noise-free properties. Implementation on real and simulated datasets demonstrates its decent performance compared with state-of-art procedures. It also has the potential of expansion to be incorporated with other data type and/or more general between-group comparison problems. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticulate drug delivery systems have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer agents, and combination therapy is a promising strategy for clinical cancer treatment with synergistic effects. The purpose of this report is to evaluate a smart, biocompatible, magnetic nanocarrier for the intracellular co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and methotrexate (MTX) to the MCF7 cell line. Since dendritic architecture based nanoparticles can load high doses of drugs with various properties, we evaluated dendritic chitosan grafted mPEG coated magnetic nanoparticles (DPC@MNPs) as a magnetic nanocarrier that has potential in multi-drug delivery. DPC@MNPs with high encapsulation efficiencies of 95.96% for DOX and 67.91% for MTX, has shown controlled and pH-dependent behaviour with tumor target release. After confirmation of the nanocarrier biocompatibility with human red blood cells by hemolysis assay, SDS-PAGE assay was performed to simulate how the nanocarrier interacts with proteins that exist in the blood circulation systems. The results show that several proteins in human blood plasma could attach to the nanocarrier surface and provide the nanocarrier with stealth properties that are suitable for drug delivery systems. An in vitro study of cell viability showed that combination drug delivery has synergistic effects and reduces toxic side effects. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity assay of the nanocarrier to the MCF7 cell line indicated that DPC@MNPs is suitable as an anticancer drug nanocarrier. Dual-drug delivery with efficient anticancer performance was also confirmed by DAPI staining, cellular uptake, cell cycle, and apoptosis analysis, compared to free dual anticancer drugs. To assess the healthy, apoptotic, and necrotic cells, DAPI staining and apoptosis analysis by flow-cytometry were conducted and all data showed that the apoptotic effects of the drug-loaded nanocarrier are higher in comparison to the corresponding free drugs. Cellular uptake was also examined to validate the internalization of the nanocarrier in the cells and the results have shown that a high uptake percentage was observed within 3 h. Finally, the side effects of the drug-loaded nanocarrier and free drugs were assessed using the mouse model and it was concluded that this combination therapy offers a promising approach to cancer treatment and can be used for further in vivo applications. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Aiming to understand cellular responses to different perturbations, the NIH Common Fund Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program involves many institutes and laboratories working on over a thousand cell lines. The community-based Cell Line Ontology (CLO) is selected as the default ontology for LINCS cell line representation and integration. Results: CLO has consistently represented all 1097 LINCS cell lines and included information extracted from the LINCS Data Portal and ChEMBL. Using MCF 10A cell line cells as an example, we demonstrated how to ontologically model LINCS cellular signatures such as their non-tumorigenic epithelial cell type, three-dimensional growth, latrunculin-A-induced actin depolymerization and apoptosis, and cell line transfection. A CLO subset view of LINCS cell lines, named LINCS-CLOview, was generated to support systematic LINCS cell line analysis and queries. In summary, LINCS cell lines are currently associated with 43 cell types, 131 tissues and organs, and 121 cancer types. The LINCS-CLO view information can be queried using SPARQL scripts. Conclusions: CLO was used to support ontological representation, integration, and analysis of over a thousand LINCS cell line cells and their cellular responses. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lung function is an important predictor of morbidity and mortality, with accelerated lung function decline reported to have immense consequences for the world's healthcare systems. The lung function decline across individual's lifetime is a consequence of age-related changes in lung anatomical structure and combination of various environmental factors; however, the exact molecular mechanisms contributing to this decline are not fully understood. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that changes across individual's lifetime, as well as allows for interplay between environmental and genetic factors. DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulation of gene expression, with increasing evidence linking aberrant DNA methylation levels with a number of common human diseases. In this study, we investigated possible associations between genome-wide DNA methylation levels and lung function in 169 pairs of middle-aged monozygotic twins (86 male pairs: mean age (min-max) = 66 years (57-79); 83 female pairs: mean age (min-max) = 66 years (56-78)). The twins were collected from the Danish Twin Registry and were examined at baseline (1998-1999) and follow-up (2008-2011) visits. Using the twin design, we correlated intra-pair differences in cross-sectional and longitudinal lung function with intra-pair blood DNA methylation differences at follow-up by linear regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, BMI, smoking, and blood cell composition measured for each individual with the use of flow cytometry. Results: We identified several differentially methylated CpG sites associated with forced expiratory volume the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Three probes identified for level of FVC were located in GLIPR1L2 gene (lowest p value = 7.14 × 10-8), involved in innate immunity and tumour-suppressor/pro-oncogenic mechanisms. Change in FEV1 during the 11-year follow-up period was associated with blood DNA methylation level in TRIM27 gene (p value = 1.55 × 10-6), a negative regulator of CD4 T cells, and also involved in cancer development. Several enriched pathways were identified, especially for FEV1, with one being \"TGFBR\" (Benjamini-Hochbergadj p value = 0.045), the receptor for TGFβ, a growth factor involved in normal lung tissue repair through pro-fibrotic effects. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that epigenetic regulation of immunological- and cancer-related genes, as well as TGF-β-receptor-related genes, may be involved in the cross-sectional level and longitudinal change in lung function in middle-aged monozygotic twins. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite a well-established role for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in tumorigenesis, EGFR activities and endocytosis in tumors in vivo have not been studied. We labeled endogenous EGFR with GFP by genome-editing of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, which were used to examine EGFR-GFP behavior in mouse tumor xenografts in vivo. Intravital multiphoton imaging, confocal imaging of cryosections and biochemical analysis revealed that localization and trafficking patterns, as well as levels of phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of EGFR in tumors in vivo closely resemble patterns and levels observed in the same cells treated with 20- 200 pM EGF in vitro. Consistent with the prediction of low ligand concentrations in tumors, EGFR endocytosis was kinase-dependent and blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated internalization; and EGFR activity was insensitive to Cbl overexpression. Collectively, our data suggest that a small pool of active EGFRs is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis by signaling primarily through the Ras- MAPK pathway. © Pinilla-Macua et al.",

    "Abstract": "Adoptive therapy with regulatory T cells or tolerance-inducing antigen (Ag)-presenting cells is innovative and promising therapeutic approach to control undesired and harmful activation of the immune system, as observed in autoimmune diseases, solid organ and bone marrow transplantation. One of the critical issues to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for success or failure of these therapies and define the specificity of the therapy is the evaluation of the Ag-specific T-cell responses. Several efforts have been made to develop suitable and reproducible assays. Here, we focus on dye-based proliferation assays. We highlight with practical examples the fundamental issues to take into consideration for implementation of an effective and sensitive dye-based proliferation assay to monitor Ag-specific responses in patients. The most critical points were used to design a road map to set up and analyze the optimal assay to assess Ag-specific T-cell responses in patients undergoing different treatments. This is the first step to optimize monitoring of tolerance induction, allowing comparison of outcomes of different clinical studies. The road map can also be applied to other therapeutic interventions, not limited to tolerance induction therapies, in which Ag-specific T-cell responses are relevant such as vaccination approaches and cancer immunotherapy. © 2017 Ten Brinke, Marek-Trzonkowska, Mansilla, Turksma, Piekarska, Iwaszkiewicz-Grzes, Passerini, Locafaro, Puñet-Ortiz, van Ham, Hernandez-Fuentes, Martínez-Cáceres and Gregori.",

    "Abstract": "The interaction between intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) and the integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is crucial for the regulation of several physiological and pathophysiological processes like cell-mediated elimination of tumor or virus infected cells, cancer metastasis, or inflammatory and autoimmune processes. Using purified proteins it was reported a species restriction for the interaction of ICAM-1 and LFA-1, being mouse ICAM-1 able to interact with human LFA-1 but not human ICAM-1 with mouse LFA-1. However, in vivo results employing tumor cells transfected with human ICAM-1 suggest that functionally mouse LFA-1 can recognize human ICAM-1. In order to clarify the interspecies cross-reactivity of the ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction, we have performed functional studies analyzing the ability of human soluble ICAM-1 and human/mouse LFA-1 derived peptides to inhibit cell aggregation and adhesion as well as cell-mediated cytotoxicity in both mouse and human systems. In parallel, the affinity of the interaction between mouse LFA-1-derived peptides and human ICAM-1 was determined by calorimetry assays. According to the results obtained, it seems that human ICAM-1 is able to interact with mouse LFA-1 on intact cells, which should be taking into account when using humanized mice and xenograft models for the study of immune-related processes. © 2017 Núñez, Comas, Lanuza, Sánchez-Martinez, Pérez-Hernández, Catalán, Domingo, Velázquez-Campoy, Pardo and Gálvez.",
