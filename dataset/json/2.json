    "Abstract": "To analyze the level and diagnostic value of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in gastric cancer (GC) of Han and Uygur in Xinjiang, China, we collected 42 GC and 47 normal gastric tissues and performed tissue microarray. In situ hybridization was used to detect PVT1, while immunohistochemistry was used to analyze c-myc. The relationship between PVT1, c-myc and clinical pathological features was investigated. We then analyzed the expression of PVT1 in six GC cell lines. RNA interference was used to silence PVT1 in BGC823 and AGS cells. c-myc was detected by western blotting after silencing PVT1, while proliferation, invasion and migration ability were also analyzed. We found that PVT1 and c-myc were highly expressed in both Han and Uygur GC tissues. In Han GC, PVT1 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and primary tumor site. In Uygur GC, both PVT1 and c-myc were correlated with lymph node metastasis and clinical staging. PVT1 was positively correlated with c-myc. BGC823 and AGS cells exhibited high levels of PVT1. When PVT1 expression was silenced, the expression of c-myc decreased, while migration and invasion ability were also decreased in cells. PVT1 could therefore be a potential biomarker to predict the metastatic tendency of GC in both Han and Uygur patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) protects against potentially damaging events, such as excessive generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). We investigated the contribution of the two major MQC processes, namely, mitophagy and Mieap-induced accumulation of lysosomes within mitochondria (MALM), to the response to hypoxia of two human gastric cancer (GC) cell lines. We found that hypoxia increased mtROS generation and cell invasion in 58As9, but not in MKN45, although the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α was induced in both cell lines. Colocalisation of lysosomes with mitochondria was found only in hypoxic MKN45 cells, suggesting that hypoxia-induced MQC functions normally in MKN45 but may be impaired in 58As9. Hypoxia did not lead to decreased mitochondrial mass or DNA or altered appearance of autophagosomes, as judged by electron microscopy, suggesting that mitophagy was not induced in either cell line. However, western blot analysis revealed the presence of the MALM-associated proteins Mieap, BNIP3 and BNIP3L, and the lysosomal protein cathepsin D in the mitochondrial fraction of MKN45 cells under hypoxia. Finally, Mieap knockdown in MKN45 cells resulted in increased mtROS accumulation and cell invasion under hypoxia. Our results suggest that hypoxia-induced MALM suppresses GC cell invasion by preventing mtROS generation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer detection in early stage using a powerful and noninvasive tool is of high global interest. In this experiment, a small-molecular-weight glucose based derivative of Gd 3+ -1-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl) diethylene tri amine penta acetic acid (Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA-DG) as a novel potential MR imaging contrast agents was synthesized. Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA-DG was synthesized with reacting of Glucosamine and 1-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl) diethylene triamine penta acetic acid then loaded by gadolinium to make novel agent of functional MR imaging. The relaxivity, T 1 , T 2 relaxation times, and cell toxicity of this contrast agent were studied. The results demonstrated that the sugar moieties linked to Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA efficiently increase its cellular uptake in normal cells 25% and in cancereous cells upto 67%. The Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA-DG significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased MCF-7 tumor cell numbers without any significant toxicity on normal human kidney cells. Finally, it displayed an intense signal on T 1 weighted with respect to the unlabeled cells. Based on the findings from the present research Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA-DG be a potential breast molecular imaging. However, further investigations by anticancer studies are in the pipeline. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis, which is mainly due to late diagnosis and profound resistance to treatment. The latter is to a large extent attributed to the tumor stroma that is exceedingly prominent in PDAC and engages in complex interactions with the cancer cells. Hence, relevant preclinical models of PDAC should also include the tumor stroma. We herein describe the establishment and functional validation of an ex vivo organotypic culture of human PDAC that is based on precision-cut tissue slices from surgical specimens and reproducibly recapitulates the complex cellular and acellular composition of PDAC, including its microenvironment. The cancer cells, tumor microenvironment and interspersed remnants of nonneoplastic pancreas contained in these 350 µm thick slices maintained their structural integrity, phenotypic characteristics and functional activity when in culture for at least 4 days. In particular, tumor cell proliferation persisted and the grade of differentiation and morphological phenotype remained unaltered. Cultured tissue slices were metabolically active and responsive to rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. This culture system is to date the closest surrogate to the parent carcinoma and harbors great potential as a drug sensitivity testing system for the personalized treatment of PDAC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cetuximab is a standard-of-care treatment for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) but not for those harbor a KRAS mutation since MAPK pathway is constitutively activated. Nevertheless, cetuximab also exerts its effect by its immunomodulatory activity despite the presence of RAS mutation. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of polymorphism FcγRIIIa V158F and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes on the outcome of mCRC patients with KRAS mutations treated with cetuximab. This multicenter Phase II clinical trial included 70 mCRC patients with KRAS mutated. We found KIR2DS4 gene was significantly associated with OS (HR 2.27; 95% CI, 1.08–4.77; P = 0.03). In non-functional receptor homozygotes the median OS was 2.6 months longer than in carriers of one copy of full receptor. Multivariate analysis confirmed KIR2DS4 as a favorable prognostic marker for OS (HR 6.71) in mCRC patients with KRAS mutation treated with cetuximab. These data support the potential therapeutic of cetuximab in KRAS mutated mCRC carrying non-functional receptor KIR2DS4 since these patients significantly prolong their OS even after heavily treatment. KIR2DS4 typing could be used as predictive marker for identifying RAS mutated patients that could benefit from combination approaches of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies and other immunotherapies to overcome the resistance mediated by mutation in RAS. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Elevated MYC expression sensitizes tumor cells to apoptosis but the therapeutic potential of this mechanism remains unclear. We find, in a model of MYC-driven breast cancer, that pharmacological activation of AMPK strongly synergizes with BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors to activate apoptosis. We demonstrate the translational potential of an AMPK and BCL-2/BCL-XL co-targeting strategy in ex vivo and in vivo models of MYC-high breast cancer. Metformin combined with navitoclax or venetoclax efficiently inhibited tumor growth, conferred survival benefits and induced tumor infiltration by immune cells. However, withdrawal of the drugs allowed tumor re-growth with presentation of PD-1+/CD8+ T cell infiltrates, suggesting immune escape. A two-step treatment regimen, beginning with neoadjuvant metformin+venetoclax to induce apoptosis and followed by adjuvant metformin+venetoclax+anti-PD-1 treatment to overcome immune escape, led to durable antitumor responses even after drug withdrawal. We demonstrate that pharmacological reactivation of MYC-dependent apoptosis is a powerful antitumor strategy involving both tumor cell depletion and immunosurveillance. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is associated with a frequent loss in ARID1A function. ARID1A reportedly suppresses histone deacetylase (HDAC)6 in OCCC directly. Here, we evaluated the clinical significance of HDAC6 expression and its related factors in terms of ARID1A status. Immunohistochemical expression of HDAC6, hypoxia inducible factors-1α (HIF-1α), programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), CD44 (cancer stem cell marker), and ARID1A was analysed for 106 OCCC patients. High nuclear HDAC6 expression correlated with patient death (p = 0.038). In the multivariate analysis of overall survival, surgical status (complete or incomplete resection) (hazard ratio (HR) = 17.5; p = <0.001), HDAC6 nuclear expression (HR = 1.68; p = 0.034), and PD-L1 expression (HR = 1.95; p = 0.022) were the independent prognostic factors. HDAC6 upregulation and ARID1A loss did not necessarily occur simultaneously. High HDAC6 expression was associated with poor prognosis in OCCC with ARID1A loss; this was not observed without ARID1A loss. HDAC6 expression showed a significant positive correlation with HIF-1α, PD-L1, and CD44. In OCCC, HDAC6 involvement in prognosis depended on ARID1A status. HDAC6 also led to immuno- and hypoxia- tolerance and cancer stem cell phenotype. HDAC6 is a promising therapeutic target for OCCC with loss of ARID1A. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Treatment of gastric cancer (GC) often produces poor outcomes. Moreover, predicting which GC treatments will be effective remains challenging. Computational drug repositioning using public databases is a promising and efficient tool for discovering new uses for existing drugs. Here we used a computational reversal of gene expression approach based on effects on gene expression signatures by GC disease and drugs to explore new GC drug candidates. Gene expression profiles for individual GC tumoral and normal gastric tissue samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC were determined with a meta-signature analysis. Profiles drug activity and drug-induced gene expression were downloaded from the ChEMBL and the LINCS databases, respectively. Candidate drugs to treat GC were predicted using reversal gene expression score (RGES). Drug candidates including sorafenib, olaparib, elesclomol, tanespimycin, selumetinib, and ponatinib were predicted to be active for treatment of GC. Meanwhile, GC-related genes such as PLOD3, COL4A1, UBE2C, MIF, and PRPF5 were identified as having gene expression profiles that can be reversed by drugs. These findings support the use of a computational reversal gene expression approach to identify new drug candidates that can be used to treat GC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has become increasingly important for the clinical assessment of prostate cancer (PCa), but its interpretation is generally variable due to its relatively subjective nature. Radiomics and classification methods have shown potential for improving the accuracy and objectivity of mpMRI-based PCa assessment. However, these studies are limited to a small number of classification methods, evaluation using the AUC score only, and a non-rigorous assessment of all possible combinations of radiomics and classification methods. This paper presents a systematic and rigorous framework comprised of classification, cross-validation and statistical analyses that was developed to identify the best performing classifier for PCa risk stratification based on mpMRI-derived radiomic features derived from a sizeable cohort. This classifier performed well in an independent validation set, including performing better than PI-RADS v2 in some aspects, indicating the value of objectively interpreting mpMRI images using radiomics and classification methods for PCa risk assessment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is progressively increasing tumor with lack of accurate prognosis and inadequate systemic treatment approaches. Solanum sp. (such as Solanum melongena) is a folk herb which is reported to possess anticancer properties. In a continuity for our interest in pursuing the anticancer activity of compounds isolated from the fruit peels of Solanum melongena, the HPLC profiling and ESI-MS assessment for the methanolic extract evidenced the presence of bioactive glycoalkaloids (solasonine, solasodine and solamargine). These glycoalkaloids were isolated, purified and proved to possess in vitro cytotoxicity against human liver cancer cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2). Herein, we investigated the potential mechanism of action of these compounds using DNA content flow-cytometry and apoptosis/necrosis differential anaylsis using annexin-V/FITC staining. Solasonine, solasodine and solamargine inducd significant antiproliferative effect against liver cancer cells (Huh7 and HepG2) which was attributed to cell cycle arrest at S-phase. Solamargine, solasodine and solasonine induced significant apoptosis in Huh7 cells. Only solamargine-induced cell cycle arrest, was reflected as apoptotic cell killing effect against HepG2 cells. In conclusion, glycoalkaloids derived from Solanum melongena and particularly, solamargine are promising antiproliferative agents with potential anticancer effects. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumors are not static masses of cells but dynamic ecosystems where cancer cells experience constant turnover and evolve fitness-enhancing phenotypes. Selection for different phenotypes may vary with (1) the tumor niche (edge or core), (2) cell turnover rates, (3) the nature of the tradeoff between traits, and (4) whether deaths occur in response to demographic or environmental stochasticity. Using a spatially-explicit agent-based model, we observe how two traits (proliferation rate and migration speed) evolve under different tradeoff conditions with different turnover rates. Migration rate is favored over proliferation at the tumor’s edge and vice-versa for the interior. Increasing cell turnover rates slightly slows tumor growth but accelerates the rate of evolution for both proliferation and migration. The absence of a tradeoff favors ever higher values for proliferation and migration, while a convex tradeoff tends to favor proliferation, often promoting the coexistence of a generalist and specialist phenotype. A concave tradeoff favors migration at low death rates, but switches to proliferation at higher death rates. Mortality via demographic stochasticity favors proliferation, and environmental stochasticity favors migration. While all of these diverse factors contribute to the ecology, heterogeneity, and evolution of a tumor, their effects may be predictable and empirically accessible. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In the last years it has been shown that many components of tumor microenvironment (TM) can induce cell signaling that permit to breast cancer cells (BC) to maintain their aggressiveness. Ion channels have a role in mediating TM signal; recently we have demonstrated a functional collaboration between Kv10.1 and Orai1 channels in mediating the pro-survival effect of collagen 1 on BC cells. Here we show how SPCA2 (Secretory Pathway Ca2+ ATPase) has a role in this process and is able to support survival and proliferation induced by collagen 1. By participating to an auto-sustaining loop, SPCA2 enhances membrane expression of Kv10.1 and Orai1; the activity of every component of this trio is necessary to mediate a store independent calcium entry (SICE). This SICE is fundamental to maintain both the activation of the pro-survival pathway and the membrane localization and consequently the activity of the two channels. Moreover, the three proteins and the collagen receptor DDR1 are overexpressed only in aggressive tumors tissues. In this work, we propose a novel association between SPCA2, Kv10.1 and Orai1 involved in mediating transduction signals from TM to the BC cells that can be potentially exploited in the search of novel therapeutic targets specific to tumor tissues. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "If anastomotic site leakage is expected after laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR), de-functioning ileostomy is required. However, there is controversy about the consequence of stoma formation via the specimen extraction site (SES). Therefore, we aimed to investigate stoma-related complication according to stoma formation via the SES. We enrolled rectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic LAR with temporary ileostomy between January 2013 and December 2017. Patients were divided into two groups: stoma through the SES (SES) and stoma through a new site (NS). The difference in the incidence of stoma-related complications was analysed. In total, 198 patients underwent laparoscopic LAR (SES = 141 patients, NS = 57 patients). The SES group had a shorter operation time (204.7 ± 74.4 min vs 229.5 ± 90.5 min, p = 0.049) and was associated with fewer cases of wound infection (0% vs 7%, p = 0.006) than the NS group. There was no statistically significant difference between the SES group and NS group in all-stoma complications (22.7% vs 12.3%, p = 0.095). The incidence of parastomal hernia also was not significantly different (11.3% vs 5.3%, p = 0.286). Stoma via the SES is feasible after laparoscopic LAR with temporary ileostomy, although stoma-related complication rate was higher, without a significant difference. It can shorten the operation time and reduce wound infection rate. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Although B cell response is frequently found in cancer, there is little evidence that it alters tumor development or progression. The process through which tumor-associated antigens trigger humoral response is not well delineated. We investigate the repertoire of antigens associated with humoral immune response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using in-depth proteomic profiling of immunoglobulin-bound proteins from PDAC patient plasmas and identify tumor antigens that induce antibody response together with exosome hallmark proteins. Additional profiling of PDAC cell-derived exosomes reveals significant overlap in their protein content with immunoglobulin-bound proteins in PDAC plasmas, and significant autoantibody reactivity is observed between PDAC cell-derived exosomes and patient plasmas compared to healthy controls. Importantly, PDAC-derived exosomes induce a dose-dependent inhibition of PDAC serum-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. In summary, we provide evidence that exosomes display a large repertoire of tumor antigens that induce autoantibodies and exert a decoy function against complement-mediated cytotoxicity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA exhibits differential expression levels in cancer and can affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis. Although fluorescence techniques using dye molecule labels have been studied, label-free molecular-level quantification of miRNA is extremely challenging. We developed a surface plasmon resonance sensor based on two-dimensional nanomaterial of antimonene for the specific label-free detection of clinically relevant biomarkers such as miRNA-21 and miRNA-155. First-principles energetic calculations reveal that antimonene has substantially stronger interaction with ssDNA than the graphene that has been previously used in DNA molecule sensing, due to thanking for more delocalized 5s/5p orbitals in antimonene. The detection limit can reach 10 aM, which is 2.3–10,000 times higher than those of existing miRNA sensors. The combination of not-attempted-before exotic sensing material and SPR architecture represents an approach to unlocking the ultrasensitive detection of miRNA and DNA and provides a promising avenue for the early diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "L-γ-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (GPNA) is widely used to inhibit the glutamine (Gln) transporter ASCT2, but recent studies have demonstrated that it is also able to inhibit other sodium-dependent and independent amino acid transporters. Moreover, GPNA is a well known substrate of the enzyme γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Our aim was to evaluate the effect of GGT-mediated GPNA catabolism on cell viability and Gln transport. The GGT-catalyzed hydrolysis of GPNA produced cytotoxic effects in lung cancer A549 cells, resulting from the release of metabolite p-nitroaniline (PNA) rather than from the inhibition of Gln uptake. Interestingly, compounds like valproic acid, verapamil and reversan were able to increase the cytotoxicity of GPNA and PNA, suggesting a key role of intracellular detoxification mechanisms. Our data indicate that the mechanism of action of GPNA is more complex than believed, and further confirm the poor specificity of GPNA as an inhibitor of Gln transport. Different factors may modulate the final effects of GPNA, ranging from GGT and ASCT2 expression to intracellular defenses against xenobiotics. Thus, other strategies - such as a genetic suppression of ASCT2 or the identification of new specific inhibitors - should be preferred when inhibition of ASCT2 function is required. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) becomes a unique anti-cancer drug target as its overexpression is responsible for different types of cancers. In quest of novel, effective MARK4 inhibitors, some acridone derivatives were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for inhibitory activity against human MARK4. Among all the synthesized compounds, three (7b, 7d and 7f) were found to have better binding affinity and enzyme inhibition activity in µM range as shown by fluorescence binding, ITC and kinase assays. Here we used functional assays of selected potential lead molecules with commercially available panel of 26 kinases of same family. A distinctive kinase selectivity profile was observed for each compound. The selective compounds were identified with submicromolar cellular activity against MARK4. Furthermore, in vitro antitumor evaluation against cancerous cells (MCF-7 and HepG2) revealed that compounds 7b, 7d and 7f inhibit cell proliferation and predominantly induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, with IC 50 values of 5.2 ± 1.2 μM, 6.3 ± 1.2 μM, and 5.8 ± 1.4 μM respectively. In addition, these compounds significantly upsurge the oxidative stress in cancerous cells. Our observations support our approach for the synthesis of effective inhibitors against MARK4 that can be taken forward for the development of novel anticancer molecules targeting MARK4. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We report a non-covalent loading of ginsenoside compound K (CK) onto our previously reported gold nanoparticles (DCY51T-AuCKNps) through one-pot biosynthesis using a probiotic Lactobacillus kimchicus DCY51T isolated from Korean kimchi. The ginsenoside-loaded gold nanoparticles were characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques such as field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, elemental mapping, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Furthermore, drug loading was also determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In addition, DCY51T-AuNps and DCY51T-AuCKNps were resistant to aggregation caused by pH variation or a high ionic strength environment. Cell-based study confirmed that DCY51T-AuCKNps exhibited slightly higher cytotoxicity compared to ginsenoside CK treatment in A549 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) and HT29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line). Upon laser treatment, DCY51T-AuCKNps showed enhanced cell apoptosis in A549, HT29 and AGS cells (human stomach gastric adenocarcinoma cell line) compared with only DCY51T-AuCKNps treated cells. In conclusion, this preliminary study identified that DCY51T-AuCKNps act as a potent photothermal therapy agents with synergistic chemotherapeutic effects for the treatment of cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Stability regulation of RAS that can affect its activity, in addition to the oncogenic mutations, occurs in human cancer. However, the mechanisms for stability regulation of RAS involved in their activity and its roles in tumorigenesis are poorly explored. Here, we identify WD40-repeat protein 76 (WDR76) as one of the HRAS binding proteins using proteomic analyses of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) tissue. WDR76 plays a role as an E3 linker protein and mediates the polyubiquitination-dependent degradation of RAS. WDR76-mediated RAS destabilization results in the inhibition of proliferation, transformation, and invasion of liver cancer cells. WDR76 −/− mice are more susceptible to diethylnitrosamine-induced liver carcinogenesis. Liver-specific WDR76 induction destabilizes Ras and markedly reduces tumorigenesis in HRas G12V mouse livers. The clinical relevance of RAS regulation by WDR76 is indicated by the inverse correlation of their expressions in HCC tissues. Our study demonstrates that WDR76 functions as a tumor suppressor via RAS degradation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OV) is an extremely lethal disease. However, the evolutionary machineries of OV are still largely unknown. Here, we used a method that combines phylostratigraphy information with gene co-expression networks to extensively study the evolutionary compositions of OV. The present co-expression network construction yielded 18,549 nodes and 114,985 edges based on 307 OV expression samples obtained from the Genome Data Analysis Centers database. A total of 20 modules were identified as OV related clusters. The human genome sequences were divided into 19 phylostrata (PS), the majority (67.45%) of OV genes was already present in the eukaryotic ancestor. There were two strong peaks of the emergence of OV genes screened by hypergeometric test: the evolution of the multicellular metazoan organisms (PS5 and PS6, P value = 0.002) and the emergence of bony fish (PS11 and PS12, P value = 0.009). Hence, the origin of OV is far earlier than its emergence. The integrated analysis of the topology of OV modules and the phylogenetic data revealed an evolutionary pattern of OV in human, namely, OV modules have arisen step by step during the evolution of the respective lineages. New genes have evolved and become locked into a pathway, where more and more biological pathways are fixed into OV modules by recruiting new genes during human evolution. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor vascularization is a hallmark of cancer central to disease progression and metastasis. Current anti-angiogenic therapies have limited success prompting the need to better understand the cellular origin of tumor vessels. Using fate-mapping analysis of endothelial cell populations in melanoma, we report the very early infiltration of endovascular progenitors (EVP) in growing tumors. These cells harbored self-renewal and reactivated the expression of SOX18 transcription factor, initiating a vasculogenic process as single cells, progressing towards a transit amplifying stage and ultimately differentiating into more mature endothelial phenotypes that comprised arterial, venous and lymphatic subtypes within the core of the tumor. Molecular profiling by RNA sequencing of purified endothelial fractions characterized EVPs as quiescent progenitors remodeling the extracellular matrix with significant paracrine activity promoting growth. Functionally, EVPs did not rely on VEGF-A signaling whereas endothelial-specific loss of Rbpj depleted the population and strongly inhibited metastasis. The understanding of endothelial heterogeneity opens new avenues for more effective anti-vascular therapies in cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Alterations in the exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase ε (Polε) cause ultramutated tumors. Severe mutator effects of the most common variant, Polε-P286R, modeled in yeast suggested that its pathogenicity involves yet unknown mechanisms beyond simple proofreading deficiency. We show that, despite producing a catastrophic amount of replication errors in vivo, the yeast Polε-P286R analog retains partial exonuclease activity and is more accurate than exonuclease-dead Polε. The major consequence of the arginine substitution is a dramatically increased DNA polymerase activity. This is manifested as a superior ability to copy synthetic and natural templates, extend mismatched primer termini, and bypass secondary DNA structures. We discuss a model wherein the cancer-associated substitution limits access of the 3’-terminus to the exonuclease site and promotes binding at the polymerase site, thus stimulating polymerization. We propose that the ultramutator effect results from increased polymerase activity amplifying the contribution of Polε errors to the genomic mutation rate. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Imatinib is an oral chemotherapeutic used primarily to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The potential effects of cancer treatments on a patient’s future fertility are a major concern affecting the quality of life for cancer survivors. The effects of imatinib on future fertility are unknown. It is teratogenic. Therefore, patients are advised to stop treatment before pregnancy. Unfortunately, CML and GIST have high rates of recurrence in the absence of the drug, therefore halting imatinib during pregnancy endangers the mother. Possible long-term (post-treatment) effects of imatinib on reproduction have not been studied. We have used a mouse model to examine the effects of imatinib on the placenta and implantation after long-term imatinib exposure. We found significant changes in epigenetic markers of key imprinted genes in the placenta. There was a significant decrease in the labyrinth zone and vasculature of the placenta, which could impact fetal growth later in pregnancy. These effects on placental growth occurred even when imatinib was stopped prior to pregnancy. These results indicate potential long-term effects of imatinib on pregnancy and implantation. A prolonged wash-out period prior to pregnancy or extra monitoring for possible placental insufficiency may be advisable. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Given the importance of gland morphology in grading prostate cancer (PCa), automatically differentiating between epithelium and other tissues is an important prerequisite for the development of automated methods for detecting PCa. We propose a new deep learning method to segment epithelial tissue in digitised hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained prostatectomy slides using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as reference standard. We used IHC to create a precise and objective ground truth compared to manual outlining on H&E slides, especially in areas with high-grade PCa. 102 tissue sections were stained with H&E and subsequently restained with P63 and CK8/18 IHC markers to highlight epithelial structures. Afterwards each pair was co-registered. First, we trained a U-Net to segment epithelial structures in IHC using a subset of the IHC slides that were preprocessed with color deconvolution. Second, this network was applied to the remaining slides to create the reference standard used to train a second U-Net on H&E. Our system accurately segmented both intact glands and individual tumour epithelial cells. The generalisation capacity of our system is shown using an independent external dataset from a different centre. We envision this segmentation as the first part of a fully automated prostate cancer grading pipeline. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Halocnemum strobilaceum is a halophyte present in the humid and arid bioclimatic regions of Egypt. The current study aimed at UPLC/PDA/ESI-MS n qualitative chemical profiling of the phyto-constituents underlining both antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of the bio-active fraction in comparison with the other fractions. It resulted in detection of several related compounds to prenylated flavonol icariin as a first report in this species. Results showed that ethyl acetate exhibits an appreciable antioxidant activity using in-vitro DPPH assay with percentage of 82.35% and remarkable anticancer capacity against most common types of cancer in Egypt; breast (MCF-7), human prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines, and human lung carcinoma (A-549) with IC 50 43.1± 2 µg/mL, 115±5 µg/ml, and 53.3±3 µg/mL respectively. These findings point out the appropriate solvent for extraction of the bio-phenolics with this halophyte which is a considerable source of remarkable potential secondary metabolites that exhibit original and interesting anticancer capacity. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "PrimPol is a human primase/polymerase specialized in re-starting stalled forks by repriming beyond lesions such as pyrimidine dimers, and replication-perturbing structures including G-quadruplexes and R-loops. Unlike most conventional primases, PrimPol proficiently discriminates against ribonucleotides (NTPs), being able to start synthesis using deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), yet the structural basis and physiological implications for this discrimination are not understood. In silico analyses based on the three-dimensional structure of human PrimPol and related enzymes enabled us to predict a single residue, Tyr 100 , as the main effector of sugar discrimination in human PrimPol and a change of Tyr 100 to histidine to boost the efficiency of NTP incorporation. We show here that the Y100H mutation profoundly stimulates NTP incorporation by human PrimPol, with an efficiency similar to that for dNTP incorporation during both primase and polymerase reactions in vitro. As expected from the higher cellular concentration of NTPs relative to dNTPs, Y100H expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and U2OS osteosarcoma cells caused enhanced resistance to hydroxyurea, which decreases the dNTP pool levels in S-phase. Remarkably, the Y100H PrimPol mutation has been identified in cancer, suggesting that this mutation could be selected to promote survival at early stages of tumorigenesis, which is characterized by depleted dNTP pools. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metabolism changes extensively during the normal proliferation and differentiation of mammalian cells, and in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Since changes in the metabolic network reflect interactions between genetic, epigenetic and environmental changes, it is helpful to study the flow of label from isotopically labelled precursors into other metabolites rather than static metabolite levels. For this Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an attractive technique as it can quantify site-specific label incorporation. However, for applications using human cells and cell lines, the challenge is to optimize the process to maximize sensitivity and reproducibility. Here we present a new framework to analyze metabolism in mammalian cell lines and primary cells, covering the workflow from the preparation of cells to the acquisition and analysis of NMR spectra. We have applied this new approach in hematological and liver cancer cell lines and confirm the feasibility of tracer-based metabolism in primary liver cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The biological role of miR-500a-5p has not yet been reported in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we show that miR-500a-5p expression is decreased in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Low miR-500a-5p expression is associated with malignant progression. Moreover, transfection of CRC cells with miR-500a-5p induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibits their growth and migration. Mechanistically, miR-500a-5p directly targets HDAC2 and inhibits HDAC2-mediated proliferation in CRC in nude mice. Furthermore, YY1 binds to the promoter of miR-500a-5p and negatively regulates its transcription. Restoration of miR-500a-5p expression is up-regulated via the p300/YY1/HDAC2 complex. Besides, therapeutic delivery of miR-500a-5p significantly suppresses tumour development in a xenograft tumour model and a HDAC2 inhibitor FK228-treated CRC model. Our studies demonstrate that miR-500a-5p functions as a tumour suppressor in CRC by targeting the p300/YY1/HDAC2 axis, which contributes to the development of and provides new potential candidates for CRC therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a lethal form of the disease, is characterized by loss of androgen receptor (AR) signaling during neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, which results in resistance to AR-targeted therapy. Clinically, genomically and epigenetically, NEPC resembles other types of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Through pan-NET analyses, we identified ONECUT2 as a candidate master transcriptional regulator of poorly differentiated NETs. ONECUT2 ectopic expression in prostate adenocarcinoma synergizes with hypoxia to suppress androgen signaling and induce neuroendocrine plasticity. ONEUCT2 drives tumor aggressiveness in NEPC, partially through regulating hypoxia signaling and tumor hypoxia. Specifically, ONECUT2 activates SMAD3, which regulates hypoxia signaling through modulating HIF1α chromatin-binding, leading NEPC to exhibit higher degrees of hypoxia compared to prostate adenocarcinomas. Treatment with hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 potently reduces NEPC tumor growth. Collectively, these results highlight the synergy between ONECUT2 and hypoxia in driving NEPC, and emphasize the potential of hypoxia-directed therapy for NEPC patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The most frequently recurring cancer-associated DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) mutation is a P286R substitution in the exonuclease domain. While originally proposed to increase genome instability by disrupting exonucleolytic proofreading, the P286R variant was later found to be significantly more pathogenic than Pol ε proofreading deficiency per se. The mechanisms underlying its stronger impact remained unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of the yeast orthologue, Pol ε−P301R, complexed with DNA and an incoming dNTP. Structural changes in the protein are confined to the exonuclease domain, with R301 pointing towards the exonuclease site. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that R301 interferes with DNA binding to the exonuclease site, an outcome not observed with the exonuclease-inactive Pol ε−D290A,E292A variant lacking the catalytic residues. These results reveal a distinct mechanism of exonuclease inactivation by the P301R substitution and a likely basis for its dramatically higher mutagenic and tumorigenic effects. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Drugs that modify the epigenome are powerful tools for treating cancer, but these drugs often have pleiotropic effects, and identifying patients who will benefit from them remains a major clinical challenge. Here we show that medulloblastomas driven by the transcription factor Gfi1 are exquisitely dependent on the enzyme lysine demethylase 1 (Kdm1a/Lsd1). We demonstrate that Lsd1 physically associates with Gfi1, and that these proteins cooperate to inhibit genes involved in neuronal commitment and differentiation. We also show that Lsd1 is essential for Gfi1-mediated transformation: Gfi1 proteins that cannot recruit Lsd1 are unable to drive tumorigenesis, and genetic ablation of Lsd1 markedly impairs tumor growth in vivo. Finally, pharmacological inhibitors of Lsd1 potently inhibit growth of Gfi1-driven tumors. These studies provide important insight into the mechanisms by which Gfi1 contributes to tumorigenesis, and identify Lsd1 inhibitors as promising therapeutic agents for Gfi1-driven medulloblastoma. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the causative agent of gastric cancer, making it the only bacterium to be recognized as a Class I carcinogen by the World Health Organization. The virulence factor cytotoxin associated gene A (CagA) is a known oncoprotein that contributes to the development of gastric cancer. The other major virulence factor vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), disrupts endolysosomal vesicular trafficking and impairs the autophagy pathway. Studies indicate that there is a functional interplay between these virulence factors by unknown mechanisms. We show that in the absence of VacA, both host-cell autophagy and the proteasome degrade CagA during infection with H. pylori. In the presence of VacA, CagA accumulates in gastric epithelial cells. However, VacA does not affect proteasome function during infection with H. pylori suggesting that VacA−disrupted autophagy is the predominant means by which CagA accumulates. Our studies support a model where in the presence of VacA, CagA accumulates in dysfunctional autophagosomes providing a possible explanation for the functional interplay of VacA and CagA. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Comprehensive genomic sequencing (CGS) enables us to detect numerous genetic alterations in a single assay. We aimed to identify molecular markers for predicting prognosis and conversion surgery in Stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) using CGS. One-hundred eleven patients with Stage IV CRC who underwent primary tumor resection were analyzed. We retrospectively investigated genetic alterations using CGS of a 415-gene panel. Clinicopathological variables and genetic alterations were analyzed to identify independent prognostic factors of overall survival (OS). Forty-five of 111 patients had R0 resection; of these, 11 patients underwent conversion surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified histopathological grade 3, R0 resection, BRAF V600E mutation, and SRC mutation as independent prognostic factors for OS (P = 0.041, P = 0.013, P = 0.005, and P = 0.023, respectively). BRAF V600E and SRC mutations were mutually exclusive, and SRC mutation was significantly associated with left-sided tumor and liver metastasis compared to BRAF V600E mutation (P = 0.016 and P = 0.025, respectively). Eleven of the 74 initially unresectable patients underwent conversion surgery for R0 resection, yet none harbored BRAF V600E or SRC mutations. BRAF V600E and SRC mutations are important molecular markers which can predict prognosis and conversion surgery in Stage IV CRC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The inflammatory response, modulated both by tissue resident macrophages and recruited monocytes from peripheral blood, plays a critical role in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we sought a model to interrogate human immune behavior in vivo. We determined that primary human monocytes and macrophages survive in zebrafish for up to two weeks. Flow cytometry revealed that human monocytes cultured at the physiological temperature of the zebrafish survive and differentiate comparable to cohorts cultured at human physiological temperature. Moreover, key genes that encode for proteins that play a role in tissue remodeling were also expressed. Human cells migrated within multiple tissues at speeds comparable to zebrafish macrophages. Analysis of gene expression of in vivo educated human macrophages confirmed expression of activated macrophage phenotypes. Here, human cells adopted phenotypes relevant to cancer progression, suggesting that we can define the real time immune modulation of human tumor cells during the establishment of a metastatic lesion in zebrafish. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor initiating cells (TIC) have been suggested as a mechanism for driving chemoresistance and tumor recurrence in human cancers including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Significant progress has been made in targeting TICs. However, methods for simultaneously targeting heterogeneous TIC populations are lacking. In this study, we found that treating TNBC cells with chemotherapeutic agents led to a significant accumulation of the ALDH + TIC population. Treating TNBC cells with a disulfiram and copper mixture (DSF/Cu) specifically decreased the ALDH + TIC population and treatment with BKM120, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, significantly decreased the CD44 + /CD24 − TIC population. Furthermore, treatment with DSF/Cu or BKM120 induced higher levels of apoptosis in ALDH + or CD44 + /CD24 − populations, respectively, than in bulk tumor cells. Combining DSF/Cu and BKM120 treatment simultaneously decreased the ALDH + and CD44 + /CD24 − TICs. Using a TNBC tumor xenograft mouse model, we found that DSF/BKM in combination with Taxol significantly reduced the tumor burden and delayed tumor recurrence compared to Taxol treatment alone. Our study is the first of its kind to use two different drugs to abolish two major TIC subtypes simultaneously and inhibit tumor recurrence. These results lay a foundation for developing a novel therapy that can improve chemotherapeutic efficacy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A large number of miRNAs influence key cellular processes involved in prostate tumorigenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated high expression of miRNAs in human prostate cancer (PC) tissues and cell lines. In previous microarray data, we found miR-141 to be upregulated and miR-145 to be downregulated in PC. In this large PC cohort (n = 535), we explored the prognostic role of miR-141 and miR-145 in PC. Tumor epithelial (TE) and tumor stromal (TS) areas were evaluated separately and combined (TE + TS). In situ hybridization was used to evaluate the expression of the miRNAs. We found that miR-141 (TE) correlated significantly to Gleason score ≥8 (p = 0.040) and large tumor size (≥20 mm, p = 0.025) and miR-141 (TE + TS) to Gleason grade (p = 0.001). MiR-145 correlated to pT-stage (p = 0.038), tumor size (p = 0.025), Gleason grade (p = 0.051) and PSA (p = 0.032). In univariate analysis miR-141 (TE + TS) was significantly associated with biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS, p = 0.007) and clinical failure-free survival (CFFS, p = 0.021). For miR-145, there were no differences between patients with high versus low expression. In multivariate analysis overexpression of miR-141 in tumor epithelium and tumor stroma was significantly associated with BFFS (HR = 1.07 CI95% 1.00–1.14, p = 0.007). To conclude, high expression of miR-141 appears associated with increased risk of biochemical PC recurrence. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ammonia can be utilised as an alternative nitrogen source to glutamine to support cell proliferation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and whether all cells have this ability is not fully understood. We find that eleven cancer and non-cancerous cell lines have opposite abilities to tolerate and utilise ammonia to support proliferation in a glutamine-depleted environment. HEK293, Huh7, T47D and MCF7 cells can use ammonia, when starved of glutamine, to support proliferation to varying degrees. Glutamine depletion reduced mTORC1 activity, while additional ammonia supplementation diminished this mTORC1 inhibition. Depletion of glutamine promoted a rapid and transient activation of AMPK, whereas, additional ammonia supplementation blocked this starvation-induced AMPK activation. As expected, drug-induced AMPK activation reduced cell proliferation in glutamine-depleted cells supplemented with ammonia. Surprisingly, mTORC1 activity was largely unchanged despite the enhanced AMPK activity, suggesting that AMPK does not inhibit mTORC1 signalling under these conditions. Finally, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) inhibition, a key enzyme regulating ammonia assimilation, leads to AMPK activation, mTORC1 inhibition and reduced proliferation. Ammonia provides an alternative nitrogen source that aids certain cancer cells ability to thrive in nutrient-deprived environment. The ability of cells to utilise ammonia as a nitrogen source is intricately linked to AMPK, mTORC1 and GDH. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Microcalcifications are vital mammographic indicators contributing to the early detection of up to 50% of non-palpable tumours and may also be valuable as prognostic markers. However, the precise mechanism by which they form remains incompletely understood. Following development of an in vitro model using human breast cancer cells lines cultured with a combination of mineralisation-promoting reagents, analysis of calcium deposition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and changes in expression of key genes was used to monitor the calcification process. Two cell lines were identified as successfully mineralising in vitro, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3. Mineralising cell lines displayed higher levels of ALP activity that was further increased by addition of mineralisation promoting media. qPCR analysis revealed changes in expression of both pro- (RUNX2) and anti- (MGP, ENPP1) mineralisation genes. Mineralisation was suppressed by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ and inhibition of TRPM7, demonstrating a functional role for the channel in formation of microcalcifications. Increased Mg2+ was also found to effectively reduce calcium deposition. These results expand the number of human breast cancer cell lines with a demonstrated in vitro mineralisation capability, provide further evidence for the role of an active, cellular process of microcalcification formation and demonstrate for the first time a role for TRPM7 mediated Ca2+ transport. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The application of layer-by-layer (LbL) approach on nanoparticle surface coating improves the colon-specific drug delivery of insoluble drugs. Here, we aimed to formulate a self-assembled cysteamine-based disulphide cross-linked sodium alginate with LbL self-assembly to improve the delivery of paclitaxel (PCX) to colonic cancer cells. Cysteamine was conjugated to the backbone of oxidized SA to form a core of self-assembled disulphide cross-linked nanospheres. P3DL was selected for PCX loading and fabricated LbL with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium salt (PSSCMA) resulting from characterization and drug release studies. P3DL-fabricated PCX-loaded nanospheres (P3DL/PAH/PSSCMA) exhibited an encapsulation efficiency of 77.1% with cumulative drug release of 45.1%. Dynamic light scattering analysis was reported at 173.6 ± 2.5 nm with polydispersity index of 0.394 ± 0.105 (zeta potential= -58.5 mV). P3DL/PAH/PSSCMA demonstrated a pH-dependent swelling transition; from pH 1 to 7 (102.2% increase). The size increased by 33.0% in reduction response study after incubating with 10 mM glutathione (day 7). HT-29 cells showed high viabilities (86.7%) after treatment with the fabricated nanospheres at 0.8 µg/mL. Cellular internalization was successful with more than 70.0% nanospheres detected in HT-29 cells. Therefore, this fabricated nanospheres may be considered as potential nanocarriers for colon cancer-targeted chemotherapeutic drug delivery.",

    "Abstract": "Preclinical studies demonstrated that radiation up-regulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, providing a rationale for combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with radiation. However this has not been validated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer due to the difficulty to obtain serial biopsies. Measuring PD-L1 expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may allow real-time monitoring of immune activation in tumor. In this study, whole blood from non-metastatic NSCLC patients was collected before, during, and after radiation or chemoradiation using a microfluidic chip. PD-L1 expression in CTCs was assessed by immunofluorescence and qPCR and monitored through the course of treatment. Overall, PD-L1(+) CTCs were detected in 25 out of 38 samples (69.4%) with an average of 4.5 cells/ml. After initiation of radiation therapy, the proportion of PD-L1(+) CTCs increased significantly (median 0.7% vs. 24.7%, P < 0.01), indicating up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells in response to radiation. In addition, patients positive for PD-L1 (≥5% of CTCs positive for PD-L1) at baseline had shorter PFS. Gene expression analysis revealed that higher levels of PD-L1 were associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, CTCs can be used to monitor dynamic changes of PD-L1 during radiation therapy which is potentially prognostic of response to treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Latinas are less likely than non-Latina Whites (NLW) to utilize mammographic screening and are more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer. Here, we examine the effects of county-level factors on guideline-concordant breast-cancer screening behaviors in Latinas and NLWs. Design: Latinas (N=108) and NLW women (N=132) aged >40 years, residing in two adjacent rural, medically underserved counties in eastern Washington State, completed a baseline questionnaire on mammography utilization and demographics. Main Outcomes: Differences in socioeconomic variables and knowledge of screening practices were examined by ethnicity and county of residence. Predictors of having had a mammogram within the past two years were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Ethnicity was not associated with having a guideline-concordant mammogram; however, age (odds ratio [OR]=1.04, 95%CI:1.01-1.08); having >12 years of education (OR=2.09, 95%CI:1.16-3.79); having a regular clinic for health care (OR=2.22, 95%CI:1.05-4.70); having had a prior clinical breast exam (OR=5.07, 95%CI:1.71-15.02), and county of residence (OR=2.27, 95%CI:1.18-4.37) were all associated with having had a guideline-concordant mammogram. Conclusions: County of residence and having had a prior CBE were strong predictors of screening utilization. Community-level factors in medically underserved areas may influence screening patterns. © 2019 Ethnicity & Disease Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional radiomics involves the extraction of quantitative texture features from medical images in an attempt to determine correlations with clinical endpoints. We hypothesize that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could enhance the performance of traditional radiomics, by detecting image patterns that may not be covered by a traditional radiomic framework. We test this hypothesis by training a CNN to predict treatment outcomes of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, based solely on their pre-treatment computed tomography image. The training (194 patients) and validation sets (106 patients), which are mutually independent and include 4 institutions, come from The Cancer Imaging Archive. When compared to a traditional radiomic framework applied to the same patient cohort, our method results in a AUC of 0.88 in predicting distant metastasis. When combining our model with the previous model, the AUC improves to 0.92. Our framework yields models that are shown to explicitly recognize traditional radiomic features, be directly visualized and perform accurate outcome prediction. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Autophagy is a cellular mechanism by which cells degrade intracellular components in lysosomes, maintaining cellular homeostasis. It has been hypothesized that autophagy could have a role in cancer prevention through the elimination of damaged proteins and organelles; this could explain epidemiological evidence showing the chemopreventive properties of the autophagy-inducer metformin. In this study, we analyzed the autophagy-related effect of metformin in both cancer initiation and progression in non-tumorigenic cells. We also analyzed the induction of tumorigenesis in autophagy-deficient cells, and its correlation with the ER stress. Our results showed that metformin induced massive cell death in preneoplastic JB6 Cl 41-5a cells treated with tumor promoter (phorbol) and in NIH/3T3 treated with H2O2. Inhibiting autophagy with wortmannin or ATG7 silencing, the effect of metformin decreased, indicating an autophagy-related cytotoxic activity under stress conditions. We also found an induction of tumorigenesis in ATG7-silenced NIH/3T3 cell clone (3T3-619C3 cells), but not in wild-type and in scrambled transfected cells, and an upregulation of unfolded protein response (UPR) markers in 3T3-619C3 cells treated with H2O2. These findings suggest that autophagic cell death could be considered as a new mechanism by which eliminate damaged cells, representing an attractive strategy to eliminate potential tumorigenic cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Alterations in specific DNA damage repair mechanisms in the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection have been described in different experimental models. However, the global effect of HPV on the expression of genes involved in these pathways has not been analyzed in detail. In the present study, we compared the expression profile of 135 genes involved in DNA damage repair among primary human keratinocytes (PHK), HPV-positive (SiHa and HeLa) and HPV-negative (C33A) cervical cancer derived cell lines. We identified 9 genes which expression pattern distinguishes HPV-positive tumor cell lines from C33A. Moreover, we observed that Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 (TREX1) expression is upregulated exclusively in HPV-transformed cell lines and PHK expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes. We demonstrated that TREX1 silencing greatly affects tumor cells clonogenic and anchorage independent growth potential. We showed that this effect is associated with p53 upregulation, accumulation of subG1 cells, and requires the expression of E7 from high-risk HPV types. Finally, we observed an increase in TREX1 levels in precancerous lesions, squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas clinical samples. Altogether, our results indicate that TREX1 upregulation is important for cervical tumor cells growth and may contribute with tumor establishment and progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are known due to their mutagenic activity. Among them, 2-nitrobenzanthrone (2-NBA) and 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) are considered as two of the most potent mutagens found in atmospheric particles. In the present study 2-NBA, 3-NBA and selected PAHs and Nitro-PAHs were determined in fine particle samples (PM 2.5) collected in a bus station and an outdoor site. The fuel used by buses was a diesel-biodiesel (96:4) blend and light-duty vehicles run with any ethanol-to-gasoline proportion. The concentrations of 2-NBA and 3-NBA were, on average, under 14.8 µg g−1 and 4.39 µg g−1, respectively. In order to access the main sources and formation routes of these compounds, we performed ternary correlations and multivariate statistical analyses. The main sources for the studied compounds in the bus station were diesel/biodiesel exhaust followed by floor resuspension. In the coastal site, vehicular emission, photochemical formation and wood combustion were the main sources for 2-NBA and 3-NBA as well as the other PACs. Incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) were calculated for both places, which presented low values, showing low cancer risk incidence although the ILCR values for the bus station were around 2.5 times higher than the ILCR from the coastal site. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metformin, an inexpensive, well-tolerated oral agent that is a commonly used first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, has become the focus of intense research as a potential anticancer agent. In this study, we describe the inhibitory effect of metformin in interleukin 8 (IL-8) upregulation by lithocholic acid (LCA) in HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological inhibition studies indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in LCA-induced IL-8 upregulation through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Metformin was demonstrated to block LCA-stimulated ROS production, in turn suppressing NF-κB signaling that was critical for IL-8 upregulation. An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. In conclusion, metformin inhibited NADPH oxidase, which in turn suppressed ROS production and NF-κB activation to prevent IL-8 upregulation stimulated by LCA; this prevention thus obstructed endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

Here we use cellular barcoding of two treatment-naïve TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to track the spatio-temporal fate of thousands of barcoded clones in primary tumors, and their metastases. Tumor resection had a major impact on reducing clonal diversity in secondary sites, indicating that most disseminated tumor cells lacked the capacity to ‘seed’, hence originated from ‘shedders’ that did not persist. The few clones that continued to grow after resection i.e. ‘seeders’, did not correlate in frequency with their parental clones in primary tumors. Cisplatin treatment of one BRCA1-mutated PDX model to non-palpable levels had a surprisingly minor impact on clonal diversity in the relapsed tumor yet purged 50% of distal clones. Therefore, clonal features of shedding, seeding and drug resistance are important factors to consider for the design of therapeutic strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Extra-transitional zone density (ETzD), a novel parameter is proposed to stratify the deviation of prostate specific antigen (PSA) due to structural change according to stromal hyperplasia of prostate. ETzD was conducted on a concept to estimate the PSA density (PSAD) after hypothetical enucleation of the transitional zone of an enlarged prostate by a non-linear regression prediction model with intrinsic linearity, from the retrospective analysis of PSA change observed actual enucleation by laser. The performance to predict the presence and severity of malignancy was validated by two cohorts of 3,440 prostate biopsies and 2,783 radical prostatectomy specimens. The performance of ETzD was compared with conventional parameters. The receiver operative curve of area under curve (AUC) of ETzD to predict the presence of malignacy was 0.862 (95% CI; 0.843~0.881), better than PSA, PSAD or transitional zone PSAD (TzPSAD). The AUC of ETzD to predict an unfavorable cancer among prostate cancer patients was 0.736 (95% CI; 0.705~0.768), which performs better than PSA and comparable to PSAD or TzPSAD. In summary, the performance of ETzD as a universal parameter to quantify the oncological hazard of a prostate was validated and the superiority to conventional parameters was verified. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Colon tumours are hierarchically organized and contain multipotent self-renewing cells, called Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). We have previously shown that the Notch1 receptor is expressed in Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs); given the critical role played by Notch signalling in promoting intestinal tumourigenesis, we explored Notch1 expression in tumours. Combining lineage tracing in two tumour models with transcriptomic analyses, we found that Notch1+ tumour cells are undifferentiated, proliferative and capable of indefinite self-renewal and of generating a heterogeneous clonal progeny. Molecularly, the transcriptional signature of Notch1+ tumour cells highly correlates with ISCs, suggestive of their origin from normal crypt cells. Surprisingly, Notch1+ expression labels a subset of CSCs that shows reduced levels of Lgr5, a reported CSCs marker. The existence of distinct stem cell populations within intestinal tumours highlights the necessity of better understanding their hierarchy and behaviour, to identify the correct cellular targets for therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A high throughput histology (microTMA) platform was applied for testing drugs against tumors in a novel 3D heterotypic glioblastoma brain sphere (gBS) model consisting of glioblastoma tumor cells, iPSC-derived neurons, glial cells and astrocytes grown in a spheroid. The differential responses of gBS tumors and normal neuronal cells to sustained treatments with anti-cancer drugs temozolomide (TMZ) and doxorubicin (DOX) were investigated. gBS were exposed to TMZ or DOX over a 7-day period. Untreated gBS tumors increased in size over a 4-week culture period, however, there was no increase in the number of normal neuronal cells. TMZ (100 uM) and DOX (0.3 uM) treatments caused ~30% (P~0.07) and ~80% (P < 0.001) decreases in the size of the tumors, respectively. Neither treatment altered the number of normal neuronal cells in the model. The anti-tumor effects of TMZ and DOX were mediated in part by selective induction of apoptosis. This platform provides a novel approach for screening new anti-glioblastoma agents and evaluating different treatment options for a given patient. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The human gastric mucosa is the most active layer of the stomach wall, involved in food digestion, metabolic processes and gastric carcinogenesis. Anatomically, the human stomach is divided into seven regions, but the protein basis for cellular specialization is not well understood. Here we present a global analysis of protein profiles of 82 apparently normal mucosa samples obtained from living individuals by endoscopic stomach biopsy. We identify 6,258 high-confidence proteins and estimate the ranges of protein expression in the seven stomach regions, presenting a region-resolved proteome reference map of the near normal, human stomach. Furthermore, we measure mucosa protein profiles of tumor and tumor nearby tissues (TNT) from 58 gastric cancer patients, enabling comparisons between tumor, TNT, and normal tissue. These datasets provide a rich resource for the gastrointestinal tract research community to investigate the molecular basis for region-specific functions in mucosa physiology and pathology including gastric cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) bind to the 3ʹ-untranslated region of target mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner and subsequently repress gene translation. Human miR-26a has been studied extensively, but the target transcripts are far from complete. We first employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate an miR-26a-knockout line in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. The miR26a-knockout line showed increased cell growth and altered proliferation. Proteomics technology of sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) was utilized to compare the protein abundance between the wild-type and the knockout lines, with an attempt to identify transcripts whose translation was influenced by miR-26a. Functional classification of the proteins with significant changes revealed their function in stress response, proliferation, localization, development, signaling, etc. Several proteins in the cell cycle/proliferation signaling pathway were chosen to be validated by western blot and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). The satisfactory consistency among the three approaches indicated the reliability of the SWATH-MS quantification. Among the computationally predicted targets, a subset of the targets was directly regulated by miR-26a, as demonstrated by luciferase assays and Western blotting. This study creates an inventory of miR-26a-targeted transcripts in HeLa cells and provides fundamental knowledge to further explore the functions of miR-26a in human cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Translation is a highly regulated process that is perturbed in human cancers, often through activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway which impacts directly on the ribosome recruitment phase of translation initiation. While significant research has focused on “drugging” components of the PI3K/mTOR network, efforts have also been directed towards inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F-dependent translation. Small molecule inhibitors of this complex have been identified, characterized, and used to validate the rationale of targeting this step to curtail tumor cell growth and modulate chemotherapy response. One such class of compounds are the rocaglates, secondary metabolites from the plant genus Aglaia, which target the RNA helicase subunit of eIF4F, eIF4A. Here we explore the ability of synthetic derivatives of aglaiastatins and an aglaroxin derivative to target the translation process in vitro and in vivo and find the synthetic derivative oxo-aglaiastatin to possess such activity. Oxo-aglaiastatin inhibited translation in vitro and in vivo and synergized with doxorubicin, ABT-199 (a Bcl-2 antagonist), and dexamethasone when tested on hematological cancer cells. The biological activity of oxo-aglaiastatin was shown to be a consequence of inhibiting eIF4A1 activity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The objectives of this study were to assess the associations among various physical and mental chronic conditions and napping. A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was proposed within the NutriNet-Santé population-based e-cohort launched in France in 2009. Participants were 43,060 French volunteers aged 18 y and over with Internet access. A self-report questionnaire assessing sleep characteristics was administered in 2014. The main outcome (dependent) variable was weekday or weekend napping (yes/no). The main exposure (independent) variables were overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety and depressive disorders, incident major cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina), and incident cancer (breast and prostate). The associations of interest were investigated with multivariable logistic regression analysis. No significant associations were found between major cardiovascular diseases or breast or prostate cancer and napping. Instead, we found that napping was more common among males (46.1%) than among females 36.9% (p < 0.0001). Individuals who were overweight or obese or had hypertension, diabetes, depression or anxiety disorders had an increased likelihood of napping compared with their healthy peers. The adjusted ORs ranged from 1.14 to 1.28″. In conclusion, most chronic conditions were independently associated with napping. Future longitudinal analyses are needed to elucidate causality. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an important role in the protection against intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer (CRC); however, human data are scarce. We determined members of the ECS and related components of the ‘endocannabinoidome’ in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and CRC, and compared them to control subjects. Anandamide (AEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) were increased in plasma of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) patients while 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) was elevated in patients with CD, but not UC. 2-AG, but not AEA, PEA and OEA, was elevated in CRC patients. Lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) 18:0 showed higher levels in patients with IBD than in control subjects whereas LPI 20:4 was elevated in both CRC and IBD. Gene expression in intestinal mucosal biopsies revealed different profiles in CD and UC. CD, but not UC patients, showed increased gene expression for the 2-AG synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase alpha. Transcripts of CNR1 and GPR119 were predominantly decreased in CD. Our data show altered plasma levels of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like lipids in IBD and CRC and distinct transcript profiles in UC and CD. We also report alterations for less known components in intestinal inflammation, such as GPR119, OEA and LPI. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Eupatorin has been reported with in vitro cytotoxic effect on several human cancer cells. However, reports on the mode of action and detail mechanism of eupatorin in vitro in breast cancer disease are limited. Hence, eupatorin’s effect on the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 was investigated. MTT assay showed that eupatorin had cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but was non-toxic to the normal cells of MCF-10a in a time-dose dependent manner. At 24 h, the eupatorin showed mild cytotoxicity on both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC 50 values higher than 20 μg/mL. After 48 h, eupatorin at 5 μg/mL inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by 50% while the IC 50 of MCF-10a was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) high with 30 μg/mL. The concentration of eupatorin at 5 μg/mL induced apoptosis mainly through intrinsic pathway by facilitating higher fold of caspase 9 compared to caspase 8 at 48 h. The cell cycle profile also showed that eupatorin (5 μg/mL) exerted anti-proliferation activity with the cell cycle arrest of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells at sub Gθ/G1 in a time-dependent manner. In addition, wound healing assay showed an incomplete wound closure of scratched MDA-MB-231 cells, and more than 60% of the MDA-MB-231 cells were prevented to migrate and invade the membrane in the Boyden chamber after 24 h. Eupatorin also inhibited angiogenic sprouting of new blood vessels in ex vivo mouse aorta ring assay. In gene expression assay, eupatorin up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes such as Bak1, HIF1A, Bax, Bad, cytochrome c and SMAC/Diablo and blocked the Phospho-Akt pathway. In conclusion, eupatorin is a potent candidate to induce apoptosis and concurrently inhibit the invasion, migration and angiogenesis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells through inhibition of Phospho-Akt pathway and cell cycle blockade. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Summary: Micronutrient and fat malabsorption and altered enteroendocrine signaling occur after esophagectomy for cancer; however, the impact of malnutrition on bone health in this cohort has not been previously investigated. In this study, the prevalence of osteoporosis increased after curative surgery, associated with disease-specific, treatment-related, and population risk factors. Purpose: Improved oncologic outcomes in esophageal cancer (EC) have resulted in increased survivorship and a focus on long-term quality of life. Malnutrition and micronutrient malabsorption are common among patients with EC, but the effect on bone metabolism is not known. The aim of this study was to characterize changes in bone mineral density (BMD) following curative esophagectomy. Methods: Consecutive disease-free patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit for pathologically node-negative disease from 2000 to 2014 were included. BMD was assessed at vertebral levels T12-L5 by computed tomography using a simple trabecular region-of-interest attenuation technique, and serum markers of nutritional status and bone metabolism were examined. Independent risk factors for osteoporosis were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Results: Seventy-five consecutive patients were studied. Osteoporosis was present in 25% at diagnosis. BMD declined at 1 and 2 years postoperatively (144.3 ± 45.8 versus 128.6 ± 46.2 and 122.7 ± 43.5 Hounsfield Units (HU), P < 0.0001), with increased osteoporosis prevalence to 38% and 44% (P = 0.049), respectively. No significant postoperative change in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate was observed, but alkaline phosphatase increased significantly (P < 0.001). While female sex (P = 0.004) and ASA grade (P = 0.043) were independently associated with osteoporosis at diagnosis, age (P = 0.050), female sex (P = 0.023), smoking (P = 0.024), and pathologic T stage (P = 0.023) were independently predictive of osteoporosis at 1 year postoperatively. Conclusions: Osteoporosis is prevalent among disease-free patients post-esophagectomy for EC, associated with disease-specific, treatment-related, and population risk factors. Strategies which minimize BMD decline should be considered to avoid fragility fractures in this cohort. © 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",

    "Abstract": "Carcinogens often generate mutable DNA lesions that contribute to cancer and aging. However, the chemical structure of tumorigenic DNA lesions formed by acetaldehyde remains unknown, although it has long been considered an environmental mutagen in alcohol, tobacco, and food. Here, we identify an aldehyde-induced DNA lesion, forming an intrastrand crosslink between adjacent guanine bases, but not in single guanine bases or in other combinations of nucleotides. The GG intrastrand crosslink exists in equilibrium in the presence of aldehyde, and therefore it has not been detected or analyzed in the previous investigations. The newly identified GG intrastrand crosslinks might explain the toxicity and mutagenicity of acetaldehyde in DNA metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapy has only limited efficacy against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) due to the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor-associated stroma. Here, we demonstrate an effective modulation of that stroma by irreversible electroporation (IRE), a local ablation technique that has received regulatory approval in the United States. IRE induces immunogenic cell death, activates dendritic cells, and alleviates stroma-induced immunosuppression without depleting tumor-restraining collagen. The combination of IRE and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) immune checkpoint blockade promotes selective tumor infiltration by CD8 + T cells and significantly prolongs survival in a murine orthotopic PDAC model with a long-term memory immune response. Our results suggest that IRE is a promising approach to potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in PDAC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Polyamines, often elevated in cancer cells, have been shown to promote cell growth and proliferation. Whether polyamines regulate other cell functions remains unclear. Here, we explore whether and how polyamines affect genome integrity. When DNA double-strand break (DSB) is induced in hair follicles by ionizing radiation, reduction of cellular polyamines augments dystrophic changes with delayed regeneration. Mechanistically, polyamines facilitate homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair without affecting repair via non-homologous DNA end-joining and single-strand DNA annealing. Biochemical reconstitution and functional analyses demonstrate that polyamines enhance the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 recombinase. The effect of polyamines on RAD51 stems from their ability to enhance the capture of homologous duplex DNA and synaptic complex formation by the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. Our work demonstrates a novel function of polyamines in the maintenance of genome integrity via homology-directed DNA repair. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most prevalent leukaemia in Western countries. It is an incurable disease characterized by a highly variable clinical course. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is an ideal model for studying clonal heterogeneity and dynamics during cancer progression, response to therapy and/or relapse because the disease usually develops over several years. Here we report an analysis by deep sequencing of sequential samples taken at different times from the affected organs of two patients with 12- and 7-year disease courses, respectively. One of the patients followed a linear pattern of clonal evolution, acquiring and selecting new mutations in response to salvage therapy and/or allogeneic transplantation, while the other suffered loss of cellular tumoral clones during progression and histological transformation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The splice variant sVEGFR1-i13 is a truncated version of the cell membrane-spanning VEGFR1 receptor that is devoid of its transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains. We recently showed the contribution of sVEGFR1-i13 to the progression and the response of squamous lung carcinoma to anti-angiogenic therapies. In this study, we identify VEGF165, a splice variant of VEGF-A, as a regulator of sVEGFR1-i13 expression in these tumors, and further show that VEGF165 cooperates with the transcription factor SOX2 and the splicing factor SRSF2 to control sVEGFR1-i13 expression. We also demonstrate that anti-angiogenic therapies up-regulate sVEGFR1-i13 protein level in squamous lung carcinoma cells by a mechanism involving the VEGF165/SOX2/SRSF2 network. Collectively, our results identify for the first time a signaling network that controls VEGFR1 pre-mRNA alternative splicing in cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant and highly aggressive brain tumor. In this study, four types of typical GBM cell lines (LN229, SNB19, U87, U251) were cultured in a microfabricated 3-D model to study their in vitro behaviors. The 3-D in vitro model provides hollow micro-chamber arrays containing a natural collagen interface and thus allows the GBM cells to grow in the 3-D chambers. The GBM cells in this model showed specific properties on the aspects of cell morphology, proliferation, migration, and invasion, some of which were rarely observed before. Furthermore, how the cells invaded into the surrounding ECM and the corresponding specific invasion patterns were observed in details, implying that the four types of cells have different features during their development in cancer. This complex in vitro model, if applied to patient derived cells, possesses the potential of becoming a clinically relevant predictive model. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based lipidomics is the primary tool for the structural analysis of lipids but the effective localization of carbon–carbon double bonds (C=C) in unsaturated lipids to distinguish C=C location isomers remains challenging. Here, we develop a large-scale lipid analysis platform by coupling online C=C derivatization through the Paternò-Büchi reaction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This provides rich information on lipid C=C location isomers, revealing C=C locations for more than 200 unsaturated glycerophospholipids in bovine liver among which we identify 55 groups of C=C location isomers. By analyzing tissue samples of patients with breast cancer and type 2 diabetes plasma samples, we find that the ratios of C=C isomers are much less affected by interpersonal variations than their individual abundances, suggesting that isomer ratios may be used for the discovery of lipid biomarkers. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We report herein on the design, synthesis and biological activity of Ru-based self-assembled supramolecular bowls as a potent anticancer therapeutic in human hepatocellular cancer. The potent complex induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by higher fatty acid β-oxidation and down-regulation of glucose transporter-mediated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 via reduced hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. Also, overexpressed acetyl-CoA activates the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport system and induces hypergeneration of ROS. Finally, ROS overexpressed through this pathway leads to apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the naphthalene derived molecular bowl activates classical apoptosis via crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic signal pathway. Our work into the mechanism of Ru-based self-assembled supramolecular bowls can provide valuable insight into the potential for use as a promising anticancer agent. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Detection of cellular senescence is important not only in the study of senescence in various biological systems, but also in various practical applications such as image-guided surgical removal of senescent cells, as well as the monitoring of drug-responsiveness during cancer therapies. Due to the lack of suitable imaging probes for senescence detection, particularly in living subjects, we have developed an activatable near-infrared (NIR) molecular probe with far-red excitation, NIR emission, and high “turn-on” ratio upon senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SABG) activation. We present here the first successful demonstration of NIR imaging of DNA damage-induced senescence both in vitro and in human tumor xenograft models. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bilirubin is the major catabolic product of heme degradation. It has long been regarded as an unimportant waste product. However, within the last twenty-five years, it has been demonstrated to play a very important role in maintaining the bodys redox equilibrium. Disturbances of this equilibrium - increased oxidative stress - are currently considered one of the major risk factors for the development of non-communicable diseases. Although the exact mechanism is not known, a number of human studies have proved a reduced incidence of a number of (especially cardiovascular but also cancer) diseases in individuals with mildly elevated bilirubin concentrations.

    "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell cancer, is associated with many health challenges, including damage to the kidney by tubulointerstitial fibrosis. We develop a mathematical model which captures the qualitative behavior of the cell and protein populations involved. Specifically, we model the interaction between cells in the proximal tubule of the kidney, free light chains, renal fibroblasts, and myeloma cells. We analyze the model for steady-state solutions to find a mathematically and biologically relevant stable steady-state solution. This foundational model provides a representation of dynamics between key populations in tubulointerstitial fibrosis that demonstrates how these populations interact to affect patient prognosis in patients with MM and renal impairment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Wnt-induced β-catenin-mediated transcription is a driving force for stem cell self-renewal during adult tissue homeostasis. Enhanced Wnt receptor expression due to mutational inactivation of the ubiquitin ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 recently emerged as a leading cause for cancer development. Consequently, targeting canonical Wnt receptors such as LRP5/6 holds great promise for treatment of such cancer subsets. Here, we employ CIS display technology to identify single-domain antibody fragments (VHH) that bind the LRP6 P3E3P4E4 region with nanomolar affinity and strongly inhibit Wnt3/3a-induced β-catenin-mediated transcription in cells, while leaving Wnt1 responses unaffected. Structural analysis reveal that individual VHHs variably employ divergent antigen-binding regions to bind a similar surface in the third β-propeller of LRP5/6, sterically interfering with Wnt3/3a binding. Importantly, anti-LRP5/6 VHHs block the growth of Wnt-hypersensitive Rnf43/Znrf3-mutant intestinal organoids through stem cell exhaustion and collective terminal differentiation. Thus, VHH-mediated targeting of LRP5/6 provides a promising differentiation-inducing strategy for treatment of Wnt-hypersensitive tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of <8%. Its dismal prognosis stems from inefficient therapeutic modalities owing to the lack of understanding about pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Considering the molecular complexity and heterogeneity of PDAC, identification of novel molecular contributors involved in PDAC onset and progression using global “omics” analysis will pave the way to improved strategies for disease prevention and therapeutic targeting. Meta-analysis of multiple miRNA microarray datasets containing healthy controls (HC), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and PDAC cases, identified 13 miRNAs involved in the progression of PDAC. These miRNAs showed dysregulation in both tissue as well as blood samples, along with progressive decrease in expression from HC to CP to PDAC. Gene-miRNA interaction analysis further elucidated 5 miRNAs (29a/b, 27a, 130b and 148a) that are significantly downregulated in conjunction with concomitant upregulation of their target genes throughout PDAC progression. Among these, miRNA-29a/b targeted genes were found to be most significantly altered in comparative profiling of HC, CP and PDAC, indicating its involvement in malignant evolution. Further, pathway analysis suggested direct involvement of miRNA-29a/b in downregulating the key pathways associated with PDAC development and metastasis including focal adhesion signaling and extracellular matrix organization. Our systems biology data analysis, in combination with real-time PCR validation indicates direct functional involvement of miRNA-29a in PDAC progression and is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic candidate for patients with progressive disease. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Today, drug resistance is one of the major problems in fight against cancer. Therefore, combination of therapeutic strategies was raised to effectively improve disease prognosis. In this regard, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are considered significant due to their anticancer properties. This study aimed to return sensitivity to cisplatin to A2780 cisplatin-resistance cell lines in the presence of biogenic synthesis curcumin-coated silver nanoparticles (cAgNPs). Synergic cellular effects of cAgNPs and cisplatin on ovarian carcinoma 2780 resistant to cisplatin cells were assessed using MTT assay, Acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI), DAPI staining, Annexin V/PI assay, and caspase 3/9 activation assay. Finally, expression of p53 and MMP-9 genes were evaluated using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). According to the results, 8 µg/mL and 62 µg/mL of cAgNPs and cisplatin led to 50% cell death in 48 h, respectively. Therefore, we combined non-toxic concentration of nanoparticles (1-5 µg/mL) with cisplatin (2.5 µg/mL). Decreased proliferation rate was about 50% for synergic use of cisplatin (2.5 µg/mL) and cAgNPs (2 µg/ mL). According to the results, cell death induction significantly increased by AO/PI, DAPI staining and Annexin V/PI assay in the combined group. Moreover, activity of caspase 3/9 significantly increased in the mentioned group. The combined use of cAgNPs and cisplatin resulted in upregulated expression of p53 gene and downregulated expression of MPP-9 gene. As observed in this study, a combination of cAgNPs and cisplatin increased the efficiency of apoptosis induction in A2780 cells, compared to the independent use of cisplatin or cAgNPs. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "In breast cancer (BC), elevated levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in tumor tissue have been confirmed as a strong prognostic factor in level-of-evidence-1 studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of uPA levels in serum of metastatic BC patients and to compare uPA with other blood-based biomarkers. 252 patients were enrolled in this prospective, multicentre study. Blood samples were collected before begin of first-line or later-line systemic treatment. Serum uPA was quantified by a commercially available ELISA. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected using CellSearch; other biomarkers (EGFR, VEGF, HER2, RAS p21, TIMP1, CAIX) by ELISA. Using the ROC analysis, the optimal cut-off value (determined by the Youden index) of serum uPA was 2.52 ng/ml. Using this value, 26% of patients had elevated uPA levels. Patients with visceral metastasis and more than one metastatic site were significantly more likely to present with elevated uPA levels. CTC status, serum HER2, RAS p21, CAIX, TIMP1 and VEGF correlated significantly with uPA levels. Elevated uPA levels predicted shorter overall and progression-free survival in univariate analysis (median OS: 7.5 months [95%-CI 4.5–10.5 months] vs. not reached, p < 0.001; PFS: 4.8 [95%-CI: 3.1–6.5] vs. 9.1 [7.4–10.8] months, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, elevated uPA, presence of ≥5 CTCs, elevated RAS p21, higher grading and higher line of therapy were independent predictors of shorter OS, while elevated CTC counts, higher line of therapy and negative estrogen receptor status were independent predictors of shorter PFS. In conclusion, elevated uPA levels independently predict reduced overall survival and improved prognostication in patients with known CTC status. Whether high serum uPA might identify patients most likely to benefit from therapies targeting uPA, remains to be evaluated in future trials. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recent work has highlighted the potential of metallocorroles as versatile platforms for the development of drugs and imaging agents, since the bioavailability, physicochemical properties and therapeutic activity can be dramatically altered by metal ion substitution and/or functional group replacement. Significant advances in cancer treatment and imaging have been reported based on work with a water-soluble bis-sulfonated gallium corrole in both cellular and rodent-based models. We now show that cytotoxicities increase in the order Ga < Fe < Al < Mn < Sb < Au for bis-sulfonated corroles; and, importantly, that they correlate with metallocorrole affinities for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), the main carrier of lipophilic drugs. As chemotherapeutic potential is predicted to be enhanced by increased lipophilicity, we have developed a novel method for the preparation of cell-penetrating lipophilic metallocorrole/serum-protein nanoparticles (NPs). Cryo-TEM revealed an average core metallocorrole particle size of 32 nm, with protein tendrils extending from the core (conjugate size is ~100 nm). Optical imaging of DU-145 prostate cancer cells treated with corrole NPs (≤100 nM) revealed fast cellular uptake, very slow release, and distribution into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes. The physical properties of corrole NPs prepared in combination with transferrin and albumin were alike, but the former were internalized to a greater extent by the transferrin-receptor-rich DU-145 cells. Our method of preparation of corrole/protein NPs may be generalizable to many bioactive hydrophobic molecules to enhance their bioavailability and target affinity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The present study reports the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous root extract of Arnebia hispidissima. They were prepared by adding 10 mL root extract in 90 mL silver nitrate (0.5 mM) solution and heating at 60 ± 2 °C for 12 min at pH 7.5. Characterization of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles was done using UV-Visible spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, dynamic light scattering measurements and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were crystalline in nature exhibiting different shapes like sphere, rod, triangle, hexagon and polygon. Their zeta potential was -23.6 mV confirming their high stability. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed the presence of phenolics, flavonoids and proteins as reducing, capping and stabilizing agents. The synthesized nanoparticles showed effective in vitro anti-oxidant activity against DPPH (IC50 = 9.86 µg/mL) and H2O2 (IC50 = 53.78 µg/mL) radicals. The nanoparticles showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity against HeLa (cervical cancer, IC50 = 4.44 µg/mL) cells and were non-toxic towards normal L20 B cells (non-malignant mouse cell line). They also exhibited strong anti-microbial activity against Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Geotrichum candidum (fungal strains); Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (bacterial strains). This is the first report of synthesis of silver nanoparticles using A. hispidissima root extract validating their bioefficacy against HeLa cancer cells and diverse microorganisms.",

    "Abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that can selectively target unresectable tumors through optical activation of cytotoxic agents, thus reducing many side effects associated with systemic administration of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, limited light penetration into most biological tissues have so far prevented its widespread adoption beyond dermatology and a few other oncological applications in which a fiber optic can be threaded to the desired locations via an endoscopic approach (e.g., bladder). In this paper, we introduce an ultrasonically powered implantable microlight source, μLight, which enables in-situ localized light delivery to deep-seated solid tumors. Ultrasonic powering allows for small receiver form factor (mm-scale) and power transfer deep into the tissue (several centimeters). The implants consist of piezoelectric transducers measuring 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 and 2 × 4 × 2 mm3 with surface-mounted miniature red and blue LEDs. When energized with 185 mW/cm2 of transmitted acoustic power at 720 kHz, μLight can generate 0.048 to 6.5 mW/cm2 of optical power (depending on size of the piezoelectric element and light wavelength spectrum). This allows powering multiple receivers to a distance of 10 cm at therapeutic light output levels (a delivery of 20–40 J/cm2 light radiation dose in 1–2 hours). In vitro tests show that HeLa cells irradiated with μLights undergo a 70% decrease in average cell viability as compared to the control group. In vivo tests in mice implanted with 4T1-induced tumors (breast cancer) show light delivery capability at therapeutic dose levels. Overall, results indicate implanting multiple µLights and operating them for 1–2 hours can achieve cytotoxicity levels comparable to the clinically reported cases using external light sources. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "ICD-85 (venom derived peptides) has anti-proliferative effect and anti-angiogenesis activity on cancer cells. This study was performed to test the effect of ICD-85, on Human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDF) cell lines. In this experimental study, Mitochondrial activity, Neutral red uptake, Lactate dehydrogenase (cell necrosis), and cell morphology were assessed under unexposed and ICD-85 exposed conditions. Caspase-9 colorimetric assay kit was used to determine caspase protease activity. Morphological changes in MCF-7 cells on treatment with ICD-85 compared with untreated MCF-7 cells are consistent with characterizing the features of apoptosis such as granulation and cell rounding which finally results in the generation of apoptotic bodies. In contrast, this difference was not observed in normal cells. In MTT assay, ICD-85 induced dose dependent manner cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells which were confirmed by neutral red assay. The results showed that inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) value of ICD-85 for MCF-7 cells at 24 h was 36.45 ± 0.38 μg/mL. However, when HDF cells were exposed to ICD-85, no significant elevation of LDH release were observed at concentrations below 20 μg/mL. The apoptosis-induction of ICD-85 on MCF-7 cell was found to be through activation of caspase-9 which was 13 fold greater than unexposed cell. This study showed that ICD-85 induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cell line through caspase activation and hence it can be considered for further investigation to use ICD-85 as a potential therapy for breast cancer. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) is involved in the repair and prevention of uracil misincorporations into DNA. Maintenance of DNA integrity is critical for cancer prevention. Many studies have identified susceptibility loci and genetic variants in cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the distribution frequency of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the dUTPase-encoding gene DUT in a case-control study to identify the relationship between DUT genetic variants and cervical cancer susceptibility. Six DUT intronic SNPs (rs28381106, rs3784619, rs10851465, rs28381126, rs3784621 and rs11637235) were genotyped by mismatch amplification-PCR in 400 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs), 400 precursor cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III lesions and 1,200 normal controls. No correlations were found between four DUT SNPs (rs3784621, rs10851465, rs28381106 and rs28381126) and CIN III and CSCC risk. However, the homozygous GG allele of rs3784619 and TT allele of rs11637235 correlated significantly with increased risk of CIN III and CSCC (OR = 2.29, 2.05; OR = 3.15, 3.15, respectively). Individuals with the G allele or G carrier allele (AG + GG) at rs3784619 and with the T allele or T carrier allele (CT + TT) at rs11637235 were at higher risk for CIN III and CSCC (OR = 1.26, 1.30; OR = 1.41, 1.65, respectively). Similarly, in the human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive groups, we found that the homozygous GG alleles of rs3784619 and TT alleles of rs11637235 markedly increased the risk of CIN III and CSCC (OR = 2.44, 2.71; OR = 3.32, 4.04, respectively). When performing a stratified analysis of sexual and reproductive histories, we found that the GG genotype of rs3784619 had a particularly high level of enrichment in the group of patients with > one sexual partner in CIN III (P = 0.043) and CSCC (P = 0.007). Meanwhile, the TT genotype of rs11637235 was enriched for in the high risk HPV (HR-HPV)-positive cases of CIN III (P = 0.033) and CSCC (P = 0.022). Analysis of the haplotype between rs3784619 (A/G) and rs11637235 (C/T) revealed that the genotypes with AA-TT (OR = 2.59), AG-TT (OR = 2.29), GG-CC (OR = 2.72), GG-CT (OR = 3.01 (1.83–4.96)) were significantly associated with increased risk of CIN III. More notably, this risk was much greater for CSCC (AA-TT (OR = 3.62), AG-TT (OR = 5.08), GG-CC (OR = 5.28), and GG-CT (OR = 4.23). Additionally, most GG genotypes of rs3784619 were linkage GG-CT, while most TT genotypes of rs11637235 were linkage AA-TT. In conclusion, these findings suggested that the homozygous GG allele of rs3784619 and the TT allele of rs11637235 in the DUT gene significantly increased the risk of CIN III and CSCC. Most GG genotypes of rs3784619 and TT genotypes of rs11637235 were linkage GG-CT and AA-TT, respectively. The TT genotype of rs11637235 was enriched in the HR-HPV-positive cases. These two SNPs of the DUT gene can be early predictive biomarkers of CIN III and CSCC, and may be involved in HR HPV infection. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Fulvestrant (Ful) is an effective and widely used agent for first- and second-line treatment of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative (HR+/HER2−) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, there is no evidence of treatment after progression on Ful. Our study aimed to investigate the profile of daily practice regarding therapy after Ful. A consecutive series of 131 HR+, HER2- MBC patients who failed Ful 500 mg as first-line or second-line therapy from June 2014 to June 2017 in 6 institutions were included and analysed. Among 131 patients who failed Ful with similar baseline characteristics, 31 (23.7%) received endocrine therapy (ET), and 100 (76.3%) were treated with chemotherapy (CT). The most frequently applied CT regimen was capecitabine (32%), and the ET regimen was exemestane + everolimus (35.5%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with bone-only metastasis were associated with lower CT use (OR = 7.97, 95% CI 1.51–41.84, P = 0.01). Among patients who received CT and ET as subsequent treatments, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months (95% CI 6.2–8.8) and 6.0 months (95% CI 4.1–7.9), respectively (p = 0.03). Among patients who were resistant to Ful (PFS < 6 months), the PFS on CT was significantly longer than that on ET (7.1 months vs 3.9 months, p = 0.024, HR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.26–0.97); however, among patients with a PFS ≥6 months on Ful, the efficacy of CT and ET was similar. Additionally, among patients with an older age, bone-only metastasis and ≥3 metastatic sites, no significant difference was observed between the CT and ET groups. Moreover, ET was much more tolerated than CT in terms of the incidence of grade 3/4 toxicities (9.6% vs 27%, P < 0.05). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Thus, our findings reveal the pattern of post-Ful treatment in current clinical practice and provide evidence on the efficacy, safety and choice of these treatments. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The US EPA considers glyphosate as “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.” The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A).” EPA asserts that there is no convincing evidence that “glyphosate induces mutations in vivo via the oral route.” IARC concludes there is “strong evidence” that exposure to glyphosate is genotoxic through at least two mechanisms known to be associated with human carcinogens (DNA damage, oxidative stress). Why and how did EPA and IARC reach such different conclusions? Results: A total of 52 genotoxicity assays done by registrants were cited by the EPA in its 2016 evaluation of technical glyphosate, and another 52 assays appeared in the public literature. Of these, one regulatory assay (2%) and 35 published assays (67%) reported positive evidence of a genotoxic response. In the case of formulated, glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), 43 regulatory assays were cited by EPA, plus 65 assays published in peer-reviewed journals. Of these, none of the regulatory, and 49 published assays (75%) reported evidence of a genotoxic response following exposure to a GBH. IARC considered a total of 118 genotoxicity assays in six core tables on glyphosate technical, GBHs, and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), glyphosate’s primary metabolite. EPA’s analysis encompassed 51 of these 118 assays (43%). In addition, IARC analyzed another 81 assays exploring other possible genotoxic mechanisms (mostly related to sex hormones and oxidative stress), of which 62 (77%) reported positive results. IARC placed considerable weight on three positive GBH studies in exposed human populations, whereas EPA placed little or no weight on them. Conclusions: EPA and IARC reached diametrically opposed conclusions on glyphosate genotoxicity for three primary reasons: (1) in the core tables compiled by EPA and IARC, the EPA relied mostly on registrant-commissioned, unpublished regulatory studies, 99% of which were negative, while IARC relied mostly on peer-reviewed studies of which 70% were positive (83 of 118); (2) EPA’s evaluation was largely based on data from studies on technical glyphosate, whereas IARC’s review placed heavy weight on the results of formulated GBH and AMPA assays; (3) EPA’s evaluation was focused on typical, general population dietary exposures assuming legal, food-crop uses, and did not take into account, nor address generally higher occupational exposures and risks. IARC’s assessment encompassed data from typical dietary, occupational, and elevated exposure scenarios. More research is needed on real-world exposures to the chemicals within formulated GBHs and the biological fate and consequences of such exposures. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A series of new Olaparib derivatives was designed and synthesized, and their inhibitory activities against poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases-1 (PARP-1) enzyme and cancer cell line MDA-MB-436 in vitro were evaluated. The results showed that compound 5l exhibited the most potent inhibitory effects on PARP-1 enzyme (16.10 ± 1.25 nM) and MDA-MB-436 cancer cell (11.62 ± 2.15 μM), which was close to that of Olaparib. As a PARP-1 inhibitor had been reported to be viable to neuroprotection, in order to search for new multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the inhibitory activities of the synthesized compounds against the enzymes AChE (from electric eel) and BChE (from equine serum) were also tested. Compound 5l displayed moderate BChE inhibitory activity (9.16 ± 0.91 μM) which was stronger than neostigmine (12.01 ± 0.45 μM) and exhibited selectivity for BChE over AChE to some degree. Molecular docking studies indicated that 5l could bind simultaneously to the catalytic active of PARP-1, but it could not interact well with huBChE. For pursuit of PARP-1 and BChE dual-targeted inhibitors against AD, small and flexible non-polar groups introduced to the compound seemed to be conducive to improving its inhibitory potency on huBChE, while keeping phthalazine-1-one moiety unchanged which was mainly responsible for PARP-1 inhibitory activity. Our research gave a clue to search for new agents based on AChE and PARP-1 dual-inhibited activities to treat Alzheimer's disease.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Patients with cancer during their chemotherapy period are more at risk for nutritional problems and weight loss due to oral problems. Over the years, oral care protocols and mouthwashes have been developed to control this problem. Recently, in some studies, the effect of oral care programs and honey on the nutritional status of patients under chemotherapy has been studied. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of honey mouthwash and an oral care protocol on weight loss in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: In this single-blind clinical trial, sixty patients with AML under chemotherapy admitted to Ghazi Tabatabaee hospital of Tabriz, Iran were selected with convenience sampling and were randomly assigned into three groups: honey mouthwash (n=20) and oral care (n=20) and a control group (n=20). In addition to routine care, patients in the oral care group received twice daily toothbrush, dental floss was used once a day and normal saline mouthwash, and in the honey group, honey mouthwash was used four times a day for 30 seconds (honey to water ratio 1:20). The weight of patients was measured using a digital scale at baseline and at 4 weeks follow-up (4 times). Results: The trend of weight changes in the control group was decreasing; in the honey mouthwash group, after the first week was ascending, and in the oral care group, it was almost constant.Importantly,comparison of mean weight in the study groups during the first and second weeks was not significant (p>0.05) but at the end of the third week, the difference of mean weight of the patients in the honey and control group (p=0.039) and at the end of the week in the honey and control group (p=0.001) and honey and oral care (p=0.04) were significant. The effect of intervention of honey mouthwash was significant over time (p<0.01). Conclusion: The results of the study showed that honey mouthwash improved the weight of patients during the stay, while this trend was reversed in the other two groups. Considering the effectiveness of honey mouthwash and easy use, the using this mouthwash with oral hygiene education is recommended to improve nutritional indices of patients in cancer care units. © 2019, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and hypersensitivity to aldehydes and crosslinking agents. For FA patients, gene editing holds promise for therapeutic applications aimed at functionally restoring mutated genes in hematopoietic stem cells. However, intrinsic FA DNA repair defects may obstruct gene editing feasibility. Here, we report on the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of a disruptive mutation in Fancf. Our experiments revealed that gene editing could effectively restore Fancf function via error-prone end joining resulting in a 27% increased survival in the presence of mitomycin C. In addition, templated gene correction could be achieved after double strand or single strand break formation. Although templated gene editing efficiencies were low (≤6%), FA corrected embryonic stem cells acquired a strong proliferative advantage over non-corrected cells, even without imposing genotoxic stress. Notably, Cas9 nickase activity resulted in mono-allelic gene editing and avoidance of undesired mutagenesis. In conclusion: DNA repair defects associated with FANCF deficiency do not prohibit CRISPR/Cas9 gene correction. Our data provide a solid basis for the application of pre-clinical models to further explore the potential of gene editing against FA, with the eventual aim to obtain therapeutic strategies against bone marrow failure. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Use of solid phase microextraction (SPME) for cell culture metabolomic analysis allows for the attainment of more sophisticated data from in vitro cell cultures. Moreover, considering that SPME allows the implementation of multiple extractions from the same sample due to its non/low-depletive nature, time course studies using the same set of samples are thus facilitated via this method. Such an approach results in a reduction in the number of samples needed for analysis thus eliminates inter-batch variability related to biological variation occurring during cell culturing. The current work aims to demonstrate the capability of SPME for measurements of combretastatin A4 (CA4) effectiveness on non-small cell cancer cell line. A cultivation protocol was established in the 96-well plate, and a fiber format of SPME was selected for metabolite extraction. The extracellular metabolic pattern of cells was changed after administration of the tested drug. This suggests pharmacological activity of the administered compound towards the studied cell line model. Results support that the use of direct immersion SPME for analysis of cell cultures does not affect cells growth or contaminate sample. Consequently, SPME allows the attainment of accurate information regarding drug uptake, metabolism, and metabolomic changes in the studied cells induced by exposure to the drug simultaneously in a single experiment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Sea spray aerosols (SSAs) have profound effects on our climate and ecosystems. They also contain microbiota and biogenic molecules which could affect human health. Yet the exposure and effects of SSAs on human health remain poorly studied. Here, we exposed human lung cancer cells to extracts of a natural sea spray aerosol collected at the seashore in Belgium, a laboratory-generated SSA, the marine algal toxin homoyessotoxin and a chemical inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We observed significant increased expression of genes related to the mTOR pathway and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) after exposure to homoyessotoxin and the laboratory-generated SSA. In contrast, we observed a significant decrease in gene expression in the mTOR pathway and of PCSK9 after exposure to the natural SSA and the mTOR inhibitor, suggesting induction of apoptosis. Our results indicate that marine biogenics in SSAs interact with PCSK9 and the mTOR pathway and can be used in new potential pharmaceutical applications. Overall, our results provide a substantial molecular evidence base for potential beneficial health effects at environmentally relevant concentrations of natural SSAs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Class F receptors are considered valuable therapeutic targets due to their role in human disease, but structural changes accompanying receptor activation remain unexplored. Employing population and cancer genomics data, structural analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, resonance energy transfer-based approaches and mutagenesis, we identify a conserved basic amino acid in TM6 in Class F receptors that acts as a molecular switch to mediate receptor activation. Across all tested Class F receptors (FZD 4,5,6,7, SMO), mutation of the molecular switch confers an increased potency of agonists by stabilizing an active conformation as assessed by engineered mini G proteins as conformational sensors. Disruption of the switch abrogates the functional interaction between FZDs and the phosphoprotein Dishevelled, supporting conformational selection as a prerequisite for functional selectivity. Our studies reveal the molecular basis of a common activation mechanism conserved in all Class F receptors, which facilitates assay development and future discovery of Class F receptor-targeting drugs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Digital PCR (dPCR) has been developed as a method that can quantify nucleic acids more sensitively than real-time PCR. However, dPCR exhibits large fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity of the compartment, resulting in low accuracy. The main cause is most likely due to insufficient PCR. In this study, we proposed a new method that combines dPCR with melting curve analysis and applied that method to KRAS genotyping. Since the melting temperature (Tm) of the PCR product hardly depends on the amplification efficiency, genotyping accuracy is improved by using the Tm value. The results showed that the peaks of the distribution of the Tm values of DNA in the wells were 68.7, 66.3, and 62.6 °C for wild-type KRAS, the G12R mutant, and the G12D mutant, respectively, and the standard deviation of the Tm values was 0.2 °C for each genotype. This result indicates that the proposed method is capable of discriminating between the wild-type sequence and the two mutants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the genotyping of single mutations by combining melting curve analysis and dPCR. The application of this approach could be useful for the quantification and genotyping of cancer-related genes in low-abundance samples. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer sequencing studies have implicated regulators of pre-mRNA splicing as important disease determinants in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. We hypothesized that “non-mutated” splicing regulators may also play a role in AML biology and therefore conducted an in vivo shRNA screen in a mouse model of CEBPA mutant AML. This has led to the identification of the splicing regulator RBM25 as a novel tumor suppressor. In multiple human leukemic cell lines, knockdown of RBM25 promotes proliferation and decreases apoptosis. Mechanistically, we show that RBM25 controls the splicing of key genes, including those encoding the apoptotic regulator BCL-X and the MYC inhibitor BIN1. This mechanism is also operative in human AML patients where low RBM25 levels are associated with high MYC activity and poor outcome. Thus, we demonstrate that RBM25 acts as a regulator of MYC activity and sensitizes cells to increased MYC levels. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding nucleotides playing a crucial role in posttranscriptional expression and regulation of target genes in nearly all kinds of cells. In this study, we demonstrate a reliable and efficient capture and purification of miRNAs and intracellular proteins using magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with antisense oligonucleotides. For this purpose, a tumor suppressor miRNA (miR-198), deregulated in several human cancer types, was chosen as the model oligonucleotide. Magnetite nanoparticles carrying the complementary sequence of miR-198 (miR-198 antisense) on their surface were delivered into cells and subsequently used for the extracellular transport of miRNA and proteins. The successful capture of miR-198 was demonstrated by isolating RNA from magnetic nanoparticles followed by real-time PCR quantification. Our experimental data showed that antisense-coated particles captured 5-fold higher amounts of miR-198 when compared to the control nanoparticles. Moreover, several proteins that could play a significant role in miR-198 biogenesis were found attached to miR-198 conjugated nanoparticles and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Our findings demonstrate that a purpose-driven vectorization of magnetic nanobeads with target-specific recognition ligands is highly efficient in selectively transporting miRNA and disease-relevant proteins out of cells and could become a reliable and useful tool for future diagnostic, therapeutic and analytical applications. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Oncology patients undergoing cancer treatment experience an average of fifteen unrelieved symptoms that are highly variable in both their severity and distress. Recent advances in Network Analysis (NA) provide a novel approach to gain insights into the complex nature of co-occurring symptoms and symptom clusters and identify core symptoms. We present findings from the first study that used NA to examine the relationships among 38 common symptoms in a large sample of oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. Using two different models of Pairwise Markov Random Fields (PMRF), we examined the nature and structure of interactions for three different dimensions of patients’ symptom experience (i.e., occurrence, severity, distress). Findings from this study provide the first direct evidence that the connections between and among symptoms differ depending on the symptom dimension used to create the network. Based on an evaluation of the centrality indices, nausea appears to be a structurally important node in all three networks. Our findings can be used to guide the development of symptom management interventions based on the identification of core symptoms and symptom clusters within a network. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "To find new potentially therapeutic drugs against clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), within drugs currently prescribed for other diseases (drug repositioning), we previously searched for drugs which are expected to bring the gene expression of 500 + ccRCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas closer to that of healthy kidney tissue samples. An inherent limitation of this bulk RNA-seq data is that tumour samples consist of a varying mixture of cancerous and non-cancerous cells, which influences differential gene expression analyses. Here, we investigate whether the drug repositioning candidates are expected to target the genes dysregulated in ccRCC cells by studying the association with tumour purity. When all ccRCC samples are analysed together, the drug repositioning potential of identified drugs start decreasing above 80% estimated tumour purity. Because ccRCC is a highly vascular tumour, attributed to frequent loss of VHL function and subsequent activation of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF), we stratified the samples by observed activation of the HIF-pathway. After stratification, the association between estimated tumour purity and drug repositioning potential disappears for HIF-activated samples. This result suggests that the identified drug repositioning candidates specifically target the genes expressed by HIF-activated ccRCC tumour cells, instead of genes expressed by other cell types part of the tumour micro-environment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glucose plays a crucial role in the mammalian cell metabolism. In the erythrocytes and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier, glucose uptake is mediated by the glucose transporter type 1 (GluT1). GluT1 deficiency or mutations cause severe physiological disorders. GluT1 is also an important target in cancer therapy as it is overexpressed in tumor cells. Previous studies have suggested that GluT1 mediates solute transfer through a cycle of conformational changes. However, the corresponding 3D structures adopted by the transporter during the transfer process remain elusive. In the present work, we first elucidate the whole conformational landscape of GluT1 in the absence of glucose, using long molecular dynamics simulations and show that the transitions can be accomplished through thermal fluctuations. Importantly, we highlight a strong coupling between intracellular and extracellular domains of the protein that contributes to the transmembrane helices reorientation during the transition. The conformations adopted during the simulations differ from the known 3D bacterial homologs structures resolved in similar states. In holo state simulations, we find that glucose transits along the pathway through significant rotational motions, while maintaining hydrogen bonds with the protein. These persistent motions affect side chains orientation, which impacts protein mechanics and allows glucose progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The presence of aberrant number of centrioles is a recognized cause of aneuploidy and hallmark of cancer. Hence, centriole duplication needs to be tightly regulated. It has been proposed that centriole separation limits centrosome duplication. The mechanism driving centriole separation is poorly understood and little is known on how this is linked to centriole duplication. Here, we propose that actin-generated forces regulate centriole separation. By imposing geometric constraints via micropatterns, we were able to prove that precise acto-myosin force arrangements control direction, distance and time of centriole separation. Accordingly, inhibition of acto-myosin contractility impairs centriole separation. Alongside, we observed that organization of acto-myosin force modulates specifically the length of S-G2 phases of the cell cycle, PLK4 recruitment at the centrosome and centriole fidelity. These discoveries led us to suggest that acto-myosin forces might act in fundamental mechanisms of aneuploidy prevention. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MLL3 and MLL4 are two closely related members of the SET1/MLL family of histone H3K4 methyltransferases and are responsible for monomethylating histone H3K4 on enhancers, which are essential in regulating cell-type-specific gene expression. Mutations of MLL3 or MLL4 have been reported in different types of cancer. Recently, the PHD domains of MLL3/4 have been reported to recruit the MLL3/4 complexes to their target genes by binding to histone H4 during the NT2/D1 stem cell differentiation. Here we show that an extended PHD domain (ePHD 6 ) involving the sixth PHD domain and its preceding zinc finger in MLL3 and MLL4 specifically recognizes an H4H18-containing histone H4 fragment and that modifications of residues surrounding H4H18 modulate H4 binding to MLL3/4. Our in vitro methyltransferase assays and cellular experiments further reveal that the interaction between ePHD 6 of MLL3/4 and histone H4 is required for their nucleosomal methylation activity and MLL4-mediated neuronal differentiation of NT2/D1 cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Rix7 is an essential type II AAA-ATPase required for the formation of the large ribosomal subunit. Rix7 has been proposed to utilize the power of ATP hydrolysis to drive the removal of assembly factors from pre-60S particles, but the mechanism of release is unknown. Rix7’s mammalian homolog, NVL2 has been linked to cancer and mental illness disorders, highlighting the need to understand the molecular mechanisms of this essential machine. Here we report the cryo-EM reconstruction of the tandem AAA domains of Rix7 which form an asymmetric stacked homohexameric ring. We trapped Rix7 with a polypeptide in the central channel, revealing Rix7’s role as a molecular unfoldase. The structure establishes that type II AAA-ATPases lacking the aromatic-hydrophobic motif within the first AAA domain can engage a substrate throughout the entire central channel. The structure also reveals that Rix7 contains unique post-α7 insertions within both AAA domains important for Rix7 function. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A reliable and highly sensitive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) field effect transistor (FET) sensor is reported, which was constructed by using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO). In this work, we prepared MoS2 nanosheets by a simple liquid ultrasonication exfoliation method. After the RGO-based FET device was fabricated, MoS2 was assembled onto the RGO surface for constructing MoS2/RGO FET sensor. The as-prepared FET sensor showed an ultrahigh sensitivity and fast response toward H2O2 in a real-time monitoring manner with a limit of detection down to 1 pM. In addition, the constructed sensor also exhibited a high specificity toward H2O2 in complex biological matrix. More importantly, this novel biosensor was capable of monitoring of H2O2 released from HeLa cells in real-time. So far, this is the first report of MoS2/RGO based FET sensor for electrical detection of signal molecules directly from cancer cells. Hence it is promising as a new platform for the clinical diagnosis of H2O2-related diseases. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Much effort has been made to try to understand the relationship between chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer and the immune system. Whereas much of that focus has been on the direct effect of chemotherapy drugs on immune cells and the release of antigens and danger signals by malignant cells killed by chemotherapy, the effect of chemotherapy on cells surviving treatment has often been overlooked. In the present study, tumour cell lines: A549 (lung), HCT116 (colon) and MCF-7 (breast), were treated with various concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drugs cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine (GEM) and oxaliplatin (OXP) for 24 hours in vitro. In line with other reports, GEM and OXP upregulated expression of the death receptor CD95 (fas) on live cells even at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Further investigation revealed that the increase in CD95 in response to GEM sensitised the cells to fas ligand treatment, was associated with increased phosphorylation of stress activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase and that other death receptors and activatory immune receptors were co-ordinately upregulated with CD95 in certain cell lines. The upregulation of death receptors and NKG2D ligands together on cells after chemotherapy suggest that although the cells have survived preliminary treatment with chemotherapy they may now be more susceptible to immune cell-mediated challenge. This re-enforces the idea that chemotherapy-immunotherapy combinations may be useful clinically and has implications for the make-up and scheduling of such treatments. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASIL) or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) are precancerous lesions. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in cervical carcinogenesis, but have never been assessed in anal precancerous lesions. Our aim was to evaluate the expression of miR-16, miR-20a, miR-150 and miR-155 in several grades of ASIL obtained from high-risk patients, submitted to anal cancer screening from July 2016 to January 2017. Lesions were classified according to the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) in low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and the AIN classification in AIN1, AIN2 and AIN3. A hundred and five biopsies were obtained from 60 patients. Ten samples were negative (9.5%), 63 were LSIL (60%) and 32 were HSIL (30.5%) according to the LAST. Twenty seven (26%) were negative for dysplasia, 46 were classified as AIN1 (44%), 14 as AIN2 (13%) and 18 as AIN3 (17%) according to the AIN classification. There was no statistically significant difference in the fold expression of miR-16, miR-20a, miR-150 and miR-155, according to either classification. Although non- significant, there was an increasing trend in the miR-155 fold expression from negative samples to HSIL, with the highest fold expression increase in both LSIL and HSIL compared to the other miRNAs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The exosome functions to regulate the cellular transcriptome through RNA biogenesis, surveillance, and decay. Mutations in Dis3, a catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome with separable endonuclease and exonuclease activities, are linked to multiple myeloma. Here we report that a cancer-associated DIS3 allele, dis3E729K, provides evidence for DIS3 functioning in mitotic fidelity in yeast. This dis3E729K allele does not induce defects in 7S→5.8S rRNA processing, although it elicits a requirement for P-body function. While it does not significantly influence cell cycle progression alone, the allele reduces the efficiency of cell cycle arrest in strains with defects in kinetochore assembly. Finally, point mutations in the exonuclease domains of yeast Dis3 elicit genome instability phenotypes; however, these DIS3 mutations do not increase DNA damage or RNA processing defects that lead to the accumulation of polyadenylated RNA in the nucleus. These data suggest that specific DIS3 activities support mitotic fidelity in yeast.",

    "Abstract": "The distribution of single-cell properties across a population of cells can be measured using diverse tools, but no technology directly quantifies the biochemical stimulation events regulating these properties. Here we report digital counting of growth factors in single cells using fluorescent quantum dots and calibrated three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy (QDC-3DM) to reveal physiologically relevant cell stimulation distributions. We calibrate the fluorescence intensities of individual compact quantum dots labeled with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and demonstrate the necessity of near-infrared emission to overcome intrinsic cellular autofluoresence at the single-molecule level. When applied to human triple-negative breast cancer cells, we observe proportionality between stimulation and both receptor internalization and inhibitor response, reflecting stimulation heterogeneity contributions to intrinsic variability. We anticipate that QDC-3DM can be applied to analyze any peptidic ligand to reveal single-cell correlations between external stimulation and phenotypic variability, cell fate, and drug response. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "CDC25 phosphatases play a key role in cell cycle transitions and are important targets for cancer therapy. Here, we set out to discover novel CDC25 inhibitors. Using a combination of computational methods, we defined a minimal common pharmacophore in established CDC25 inhibitors and performed virtual screening of a proprietary library. Based on the availability of crystal structures for CDC25A and CDC25B, we implemented a molecular docking strategy and carried out hit expansion/optimization. Enzymatic assays revealed that naphthoquinone scaffolds were the most promising CDC25 inhibitors among selected hits. At the molecular level, the compounds acted through a mixed-type mechanism of inhibition of phosphatase activity, involving reversible oxidation of cysteine residues. In 2D cell cultures, the compounds caused arrest of the cell cycle at the G1/S or at the G2/M transition. Mitotic markers analysis and time-lapse microscopy confirmed that CDK1 activity was impaired and that mitotic arrest was followed by death. Finally, the compounds induced differentiation, accompanied by decreased stemness properties, in intestinal crypt stem cell-derived Apc/K-Ras-mutant mouse organoids, and led to tumor regression and reduction of metastatic potential in zebrafish embryo xenografts used as in vivo model. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To prepare sorafenib-loaded folate-decorated bovine serum nanoparticles (FA-SRF-BSANPs) and investigate their effect on the tumor targeting. METHODS: The nanoparticles were characterized and evaluated by in vivo and in vitro experiments. RESULTS: SRF-loaded BSA nanoparticles (SRF-BSANPs) was first prepared and modified with folic acid by chemical coupling to obtain FA-SRF-BSANPs. The average particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and drug loading of the optimized FA-SRF-BSANPs were 158.00 nm, -16.27 mV, 77.25%, and 7.73%, respectively. The stability test showed that FA-SRF-BSANPs remained stable for more than 1 month at room temperature. The TEM analysis showed that the surface of FA-SRF-BSANPs was nearly spherical. XRD analysis showed that the drug existed in. the nanoparticles in an amorphous state. FA-SRF-BSANPs can promote the intracellular uptake of hepatoma cells (SMMC-7721) with the strongest inhibitory effect compared with SRF-BSANPs and sorafenib solution. Furthermore, the tumor targeting of FA-SRF-BSANPs (Ctumor/Cblood, 0.666 ± 0.053) was significantly higher than those of SRF-BSANPs (Ctumor/Cblood, 0.560 ± 0.083) and sorafenib-solution (Ctumor/Cblood, 0.410 ± 0.038) in nude mice with liver cancer. CONCLUSION: FA-modified albumin nanoparticles are good carriers for delivering SRF to the tumor tissue, which can improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the side effects of the drug.",

    "Abstract": "EGFR is an oncogene that encodes for a trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor. Its mis-regulation is associated to several human cancers that, consistently, can be treated by selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The proximal promoter of EGFR contains a G-rich domain located at 272 bases upstream the transcription start site. We previously proved it folds into two main interchanging G-quadruplex structures, one of parallel and one of hybrid topology. Here we present the first evidences supporting the ability of the complementary C-rich strand (EGFR-272_C) to assume an intramolecular i-Motif (iM) structure that, according to the experimental conditions (pH, presence of co-solvent and salts), can coexist with a different arrangement we referred to as a hairpin. The herein identified iM efficiently competes with the canonical pairing of the two complementary strands, indicating it as a potential novel target for anticancer therapies. A preliminary screening for potential binders identified some phenanthroline derivatives as able to target EGFR-272_C at multiple binding sites when it is folded into an iM. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we investigated the loading and conjugation of Curcumin on oleic acid (OA) and citric acid (CA) functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles and its applications in improving contrast in MRI. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 , MNPs) were synthesized using the co-precipitation method and characterized by XRD, DLS, FT-IR, VSM, and SEM. FT-IR results confirmed functionalization with oleic acid and citric acid. Curcumin was loaded and conjugated with the Nano-Systems and the amount of Curcumin loaded was quantified using spectrophotometry at 419 nm wavelength. The impact of solvent on the loading of Curcumin was studied. The wt% of loaded Curcumin was found to be 0.189 wt% using dimethylformamide (DMF) whereas using a combination of water-ethanol (15% v/v), this increased to 56.149 wt%. T2 relaxation time was determined using a 1.5 Tesla MRI machine; results showed that the MNPs reduced T2. Cytotoxicity of Nano-Systems (NS) in MTT assay showed that concentrations higher than 80 μg/mL (C NS &gt; 80 μg/mL) could lead to cancer cell death and low concentrations, up to 40 μg/mL (C NS &lt; 40 μg/mL) could be evaluated for diagnostic purposes. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) responsible for causing Kaposi sarcoma (KS), an opportunistic angioproliferative neoplasm is emerging rapidly. Despite this there is no permanent cure for this disease. The present study was aimed to design a multi-epitope based vaccine targeting the major glycoproteins of KSHV which plays an important role in the virus entry. After the application of rigorous immunoinformatics analysis and several immune filters, the multi-epitope vaccine was constructed, consisting of CD4, CD8 and IFN-γ inducing epitopes. Several physiochemical characteristics, allergenicity and antigenicity of the multi-epitope vaccine were analyzed in order to ensure its safety and immunogenicity. Further, the binding affinity and stability of the vaccine with Toll like receptor -9 (TLR-9) was analyzed by molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies. In addition, an in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a (+) vector. Such T-cell-based immunotherapies which leverage this mechanism could prove their potential against cancer. Further, the authors propose to test the present findings in the lab settings to ensure the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the presented vaccine which may help in controlling KSHV infection. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recent years have seen heat shock protein 90 kDa (Hsp90) attract significant interest as a viable drug target, particularly for cancer. To date, designed inhibitors that target the ATPase domain demonstrate potent anti-proliferative effects, but have failed clinical trials due to high levels of associated toxicity. To circumvent this, the focus has shifted away from the ATPase domain. One option involves modulation of the protein through allosteric activation/inhibition. Here, we propose a novel approach: we use previously obtained information via residue perturbation scanning coupled with dynamic residue network analysis to identify allosteric drug targeting sites for inhibitor docking. We probe the open conformation of human Hsp90α for druggable sites that overlap with these allosteric control elements, and identify three putative natural compound allosteric modulators: Cephalostatin 17, 20(29)-Lupene-3β-isoferulate and 3′-Bromorubrolide F. We assess the allosteric potential of these ligands by examining their effect on the conformational dynamics of the protein. We find evidence for the selective allosteric activation and inhibition of Hsp90’s conformational transition toward the closed state in response to ligand binding and shed valuable insight to further the understanding of allosteric drug design and Hsp90’s complex allosteric mechanism of action. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) contributes to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and inter-strand crosslinks. The HR activity in cancer cells can be used to predict their sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents that cause these damages. To evaluate HR activity, we developed a system called Assay for Site-specific HR Activity (ASHRA), in which cells are transiently transfected with an expression vector for CRISPR/Cas9 and a HR donor sequence containing a marker gene. DSBs are created by Cas9 and then repaired by HR using donor vector sequences homologous to the target gene. The level of genomic integration of the marker gene is quantified by Western blotting, flowcytometry, or quantitative PCR (qPCR). ASHRA detected HR deficiency caused by BRCA1, BARD1, or RAD51 knockdown or introduction of BRCA1 variants. The influence of BRCA1 variants on HR, as determined by qPCR, was consistent with the chemosensitivities of the transfected cells. The qPCR format of ASHRA could measure HR activity in both transcribed and un-transcribed regions. Knockdown of BRCA1 nor BARD1 did not affect HR activity in a transcriptionally inactive site. ASHRA can evaluate HR activity and will be useful for predicting sensitivity to chemotherapy, screening drugs that affect HR, and investigating the mechanisms of HR. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recently, exosomes secreted by menstrual mesenchymal stem cells have been identified as inhibitory agents of tumor angiogenesis and modulators of the tumor cell secretome in prostate and breast cancer. However, their direct effect on endothelial cells and paracrine mediators have not yet been investigated. Using a carrier-based cell culture system to test the scalability for exosome production, we showed that different types of endothelial cells present specific kinetics for exosomes internalization. Exosome-treatment of endothelial cells increased cytotoxicity and reduced VEGF secretion and angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Using the hamster buccal pouch carcinoma as a preclinical model for human oral squamous cell carcinoma, we demonstrated a significant antitumor effect of intra-tumoral injection of exosomes associated with a loss of tumor vasculature. These results address up-scaling of exosome production, a relevant issue for their clinical application, and also assess menstrual stem cell exosomes as potential anti-angiogenic agents for the treatment of neoplastic conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is a powerful tool to explore cellular heterogeneity. However, most of these methods focus on the 3′-end of polyadenylated transcripts and provide only a partial view of the transcriptome. We introduce C1 CAGE, a method for the detection of transcript 5′-ends with an original sample multiplexing strategy in the C1TM microfluidic system. We first quantifiy the performance of C1 CAGE and find it as accurate and sensitive as other methods in the C1 system. We then use it to profile promoter and enhancer activities in the cellular response to TGF-β of lung cancer cells and discover subpopulations of cells differing in their response. We also describe enhancer RNA dynamics revealing transcriptional bursts in subsets of cells with transcripts arising from either strand in a mutually exclusive manner, validated using single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Protein-templated fragment ligations have been established as a powerful method for the assembly and detection of optimized protein ligands. Initially developed for reversible ligations, the method has been expanded to irreversible reactions enabling the formation of super-additive fragment combinations. Here, protein-induced Mannich ligations are discovered as a biocatalytic reaction furnishing inhibitors of the transcription factor STAT5. STAT5 protein catalyzes multicomponent reactions of a phosphate mimetic, formaldehyde, and 1H-tetrazoles yielding protein ligands with greatly increased binding affinity and ligand efficiency. Reactions are induced under physiological conditions selectively by native STAT5 but not by other proteins. Formation of ligation products and (auto-)inhibition of the reaction are quantified and the mechanism is investigated. Inhibitors assembled by STAT5 block specifically the phosphorylation of this protein in a cellular model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DNA-binding of STAT5 dimers, expression of downstream targets of the transcription factor, and the proliferation of cancer cells in mice. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticles from magnetotactic bacteria have been used in conventional imaging, drug delivery, and magnetic manipulations. Here, we show that these natural nanoparticles and their bioinspired hybrids with near-infrared gold nanorods and folic acid can serve as molecular high-contrast photoacoustic probes for single-cell diagnostics and as photothermal agents for single-cell therapy using laser-induced vapor nanobubbles and magnetic field as significant signal and therapy amplifiers. These theranostics agents enable the detection and photomechanical killing of triple negative breast cancer cells that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy, with just one or a few low-energy laser pulses. In studies in vivo, we discovered that circulating tumor cells labeled with the nanohybrids generate transient ultrasharp photoacoustic resonances directly in the bloodstream as the basis for new super-resolution photoacoustic flow cytometry in vivo. These properties make natural and bioinspired magnetic nanoparticles promising biocompatible, multimodal, high-contrast, and clinically relevant cellular probes for many in vitro and in vivo biomedical applications. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The aims of this study are to investigate the selective cytotoxic activity of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 )-extracted freeze-dried leaf juice (FDLJ) of Carica papaya on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC25) cells, and to delineate the best small scale extraction parameters allowing maximal extract activity. Using scCO 2 as a solvent, six operating parameters were studied and the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) process investigated using a factorial design 2 6-2 . The processing values promoting cytotoxic activity towards SCC-25 are: high pressure (250 bar), low temperature (35 °C), extended processing time (180 minutes), as well as a large amount of starting material (5 g). The factorial experimental design successfully identified the key parameters controlling the SFE of molecules cytotoxic to SCC cells from C. papaya juice. This study also validated the extraction method and showed that the SFE yield was reproducible. The chromatographic and mass spectrometric profiles of the scCO 2 extract acquired with high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) were used to tentatively identify the bioactive compounds using comparative analysis. The principal compounds were likely to be mainly vitamins and phytosterols, some of which are documented to be cytotoxic to cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Telomeres are special DNA-protein structures that are located at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. The telomere length determines the proliferation potential of cells. Telomerase is a key component of the telomere length maintenance system. While telomerase is inactive in the majority of somatic cells, its activity determines the clonogenic potential of stem cells as a resource for tissue and organism regeneration. Reactivation of telomerase occurs during the process of immortalization in the majority of cancer cells. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that contains telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomerase RNA components. The RNA processing mechanism of telomerase involves exosome trimming or degradation of the primary precursor. Recent data provide evidence that the competition between the processing and decay of telomerase RNA may regulate the amount of RNA at the physiological level. We show that termination of human telomerase RNA transcription is dependent on its promoter, which engages with the multisubunit complex Integrator to interact with RNA polymerase II and terminate transcription of the human telomerase RNA gene followed by further processing. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Due to loss of tactile feedback the assessment of tumor margins during robotic surgery is based only on visual inspection, which is neither significantly sensitive nor specific. Here we demonstrate time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) as a novel technique to complement the visual inspection of oral cancers during transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in real-time and without the need for exogenous contrast agents. TRFS enables identification of cancerous tissue by its distinct autofluorescence signature that is associated with the alteration of tissue structure and biochemical profile. A prototype TRFS instrument was integrated synergistically with the da Vinci Surgical robot and the combined system was validated in swine and human patients. Label-free and real-time assessment and visualization of tissue biochemical features during robotic surgery procedure, as demonstrated here, not only has the potential to improve the intraoperative decision making during TORS but also other robotic procedures without modification of conventional clinical protocols. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Consensus ranking of protein affinity to identify point mutations has not been established. Therefore, analytical techniques that can detect subtle variations without interfering with native biomolecular interactions are required. Here we report a rapid method to identify point mutations by a single nanoparticle sensing system. DNA-directed gold crystallization forms rod-like nanoparticles with bridges based on structural design. The nanoparticles enhance Rayleigh light scattering, achieving high refractive-index sensitivity, and enable the system to monitor even a small number of protein-DNA binding events without interference. Analysis of the binding affinity can compile an atlas to distinguish the potential of various point mutations recognized by MutS protein. We use the atlas to analyze the presence and type of single point mutations in BRCA1 from samples of human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. The strategy of synthesis-by-design of plasmonic nanoparticles for sensors enables direct identification of subtle biomolecular binding distortions and genetic alterations. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "For a wide range of diseases, SNPs in the genome are the underlying mechanism of dysfunction. Therefore, targeted detection of these variations is of high importance for early diagnosis and (familial) screenings. While allele-specific PCR has been around for many years, its adoption for SNP genotyping or somatic mutation detection has been hampered by its low discriminating power and high costs. To tackle this, we developed a cost-effective qPCR based method, able to detect SNPs in a robust and specific manner. This study describes how to combine the basic principles of allele-specific PCR (the combination of a wild type and variant primer) with the straightforward readout of DNA-binding dye based qPCR technology. To enhance the robustness and discriminating power, an artificial mismatch in the allele-specific primer was introduced. The resulting method, called double-mismatch allele-specific qPCR (DMAS-qPCR), was successfully validated using 12 SNPs and 15 clinically relevant somatic mutations on 48 cancer cell lines. It is easy to use, does not require labeled probes and is characterized by high analytical sensitivity and specificity. DMAS-qPCR comes with a complimentary online assay design tool, available for the whole scientific community, enabling researchers to design custom assays and implement those as a diagnostic test. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Superresolution microscopy offers the advantage of imaging biological structures within cells at the nano-scale. Here we apply two superresolution microscopy techniques, specifically 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), a type of single molecule localisation microscopy, to localise IRSp53 protein and its I-BAR domain in relation to F-actin within filopodia. IRSp53 generates dynamic (extending and retracting) filopodia 300 nm wide with a distinct gap between IRSp53 and F-actin. By contrast, protrusions induced by the I-BAR domain alone are non-dynamic measuring between 100–200 nm in width and exhibit a comparatively closer localisation of the I-BAR domain with the F-actin. The data suggest that IRSp53 membrane localisation is spatially segregated to the lateral edges of filopodia, in contrast to the I-BAR domain is uniformly distributed throughout the membranes of protrusions. Modeling of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) data suggests that a greater proportion of I-BAR domain is associated with membranes when compared to full length IRSp53. The significance of this new data relates to the role filopodia play in cell migration and its importance to cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Neurovascular coupling, cerebrovascular remodeling and hemodynamic changes are critical to brain function, and dysregulated in neuropathologies such as brain tumors. Interrogating these phenomena in freely behaving animals requires a portable microscope with multiple optical contrast mechanisms. Therefore, we developed a miniaturized microscope with: a fluorescence (FL) channel for imaging neural activity (e.g., GCaMP) or fluorescent cancer cells (e.g., 9L-GFP); an intrinsic optical signal (IOS) channel for imaging hemoglobin absorption (i.e., cerebral blood volume); and a laser speckle contrast (LSC) channel for imaging perfusion (i.e., cerebral blood flow). Following extensive validation, we demonstrate the microscope’s capabilities via experiments in unanesthetized murine brains that include: (i) multi-contrast imaging of neurovascular changes following auditory stimulation; (ii) wide-area tonotopic mapping; (iii) EEG-synchronized imaging during anesthesia recovery; and (iv) microvascular connectivity mapping over the life-cycle of a brain tumor. This affordable, flexible, plug-and-play microscope heralds a new era in functional imaging of freely behaving animals. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Occupational exposure to silica has been observed to cause pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer through complex mechanisms. Telomeres, the nucleoprotein structures with repetitive (TTAGGG) sequences at the end of chromosomes, are a molecular “clock of life”, and alterations are associated with chronic disease. The shelterin complex (POT1, TRF1, TRF2, Tin2, Rap1, and POT1 and TPP1) plays an important role in maintaining telomere length and integrity, and any alteration in telomeres may activate DNA damage response (DDR) machinery resulting in telomere attrition. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of silica exposure on the regulation of the shelterin complex in an animal model. Male Fisher 344 rats were exposed by inhalation to Min-U-Sil 5 silica for 3, 6, or 12 wk at a concentration of 15 mg/m3 for 6 hr/d for 5 consecutive d/wk. Expression of shelterin complex genes was assessed in the lungs at 16 hr after the end of each exposure. Also, the relationship between increased DNA damage protein (γH2AX) and expression of silica-induced fibrotic marker, αSMA, was evaluated. Our findings reveal new information about the dysregulation of shelterin complex after silica inhalation in rats, and how this pathway may lead to the initiation of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Obesity is a medical condition that impacts on all levels of society and causes numerous comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We assessed the suitability of targeting enolase, a glycolysis pathway enzyme with multiple, secondary functions in cells, to treat obesity. Treating adipocytes with ENOblock, a novel modulator of these secondary ‘moonlighting’ functions of enolase, suppressed the adipogenic program and induced mitochondrial uncoupling. Obese animals treated with ENOblock showed a reduction in body weight and increased core body temperature. Metabolic and inflammatory parameters were improved in the liver, adipose tissue and hippocampus. The mechanism of ENOblock was identified as transcriptional repression of master regulators of lipid homeostasis (Srebp-1a and Srebp-1c), gluconeogenesis (Pck-1) and inflammation (Tnf-α and Il-6). ENOblock treatment also reduced body weight gain, lowered cumulative food intake and increased fecal lipid content in mice fed a high fat diet. Our results support the further drug development of ENOblock as a therapeutic for obesity and suggest enolase as a new target for this disorder. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Type II alveolar cells are highly robust in nature, yet susceptible to aerosolized nanoparticles (NPs). Dysfunction in these specialized cells, can often lead to emphysema, edema, and pulmonary inflammation. Long-time exposure can also lead to dangerous epigenetic modifications and cancer. Among the manufactured nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles are widely encountered owing to their wide range of applications. Scores of published literatures affirm ZnO NPs are more toxic to human alveolar cells than TiO2. However, signalling cascades deducing differences in human alveolar responses to their exposure is not well documented. With A549 cells, we have demonstrated that epithelial to mesenchymal transition and an increased duration of phosphorylation of eIF2α are crucial mechanisms routing better tolerance to TiO2 NP treatment over exposure to ZnO. The increased migratory capacity may help cells escape away from the zone of stress. Further, expression of chaperone such as Hsp70 is also enhanced during the same dose-time investigations. This is the first report of its kind. These novel findings could be successfully developed in the future to design relief strategies to alleviate metal oxide nanoparticle mediated stress. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Since the early detection of cancer increases the chance of successful treatment, the present study focused to confirm the suitability of an indigenously fabricated multilayer PCB technology based 3D positive ion detector to detect breast and lung malignancy at an early stage. The 3D positive ion detector is a type of gas filled radiation detector works under the principle of ion induced ionization using an exempted micro curie activity source. Earlier studies report that malignant cells can be detected by analyzing the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) exhaled by those cells that serve as eminent biomarkers for malignant detection. Based on this, the present study analyzed the signals produced in the detector by VOCs exhaled from 140 biopsy tissue samples that include tissue of normal and all stages of breast and lung malignancy. To strengthen the present data, the normal and advanced breast and lung malignant tissues were also analyzed using the Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). From this study, it is confirmed that the present 3D positive ion detector can be used to detect both breast and lung malignancy and also to distinguish them based on the variation in four basic physical parameters of the output pulse such as frequency, amplitude, rise time and fall time and four derived parameters of the pulse such as FWHM, area of the pulse, ionization cluster size, and ion drift time. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unsatisfactory and, despite major advances in genomic studies, the biological mechanisms underlying chemoresistance are still poorly understood. We conducted for the first time a large-scale differential multi-omics investigation on DLBCL patient’s samples in order to identify new biomarkers that could early identify patients at risk of R/R disease and to identify new targets that could determine chemorefractoriness. We compared a well-characterized cohort of R/R versus chemosensitive DLBCL patients by combining label-free quantitative proteomics and targeted RNA sequencing performed on the same tissues samples. The cross-section of both data levels allowed extracting a sub-list of 22 transcripts/proteins pairs whose expression levels significantly differed between the two groups of patients. In particular, we identified significant targets related to tumor metabolism (Hexokinase 3), microenvironment (IDO1, CXCL13), cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion (S100 proteins) or BCR signaling pathway (CD79B). Overall, this study revealed several extremely promising biomarker candidates related to DLBCL chemorefractoriness and highlighted some new potential therapeutic drug targets. The complete datasets have been made publically available and should constitute a valuable resource for the future research. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Radionuclide molecular imaging of human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) expression using affibody molecules could be used for patient stratification for HER3-targeted cancer therapeutics. We hypothesized that the properties of HER3-targeting affibody molecules might be improved through modification of the radiometal-chelator complex. Macrocyclic chelators NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N′,N′′-triacetic acid), NODAGA (1-(1,3-carboxypropyl)-4,7-carboxymethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane), DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid), and DOTAGA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododececane,1-(glutaric acid)−4,7,10-triacetic acid) were conjugated to the C-terminus of anti-HER3 affibody molecule Z08698 and conjugates were labeled with indium-111. All conjugates bound specifically and with picomolar affinity to HER3 in vitro. In mice bearing HER3-expressing xenografts, no significant difference in tumor uptake between the conjugates was observed. Presence of the negatively charged 111In-DOTAGA-complex resulted in the lowest hepatic uptake and the highest tumor-to-liver ratio. In conclusion, the choice of chelator influences the biodistribution of indium-111 labeled anti-HER3 affibody molecules. Hepatic uptake of anti-HER3 affibody molecules could be reduced by the increase of negative charge of the radiometal-chelator complex on the C-terminus without significantly influencing the tumor uptake. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "One of the most severe complications after successful cancer therapy is the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). Constitutional genetic variation is likely to impact on t-MN risk. We aimed to evaluate if polymorphisms in the p53 pathway can be useful for predicting t-MN susceptibility. First, an association study revealed that the Pro variant of the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the G allele of the MDM2 SNP309 were associated with t-MN risk. The Arg variant of TP53 is more efficient at inducing apoptosis, whereas the Pro variant is a more potent inductor of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. As regards MDM2 SNP309, the G allele is associated with attenuation of the p53 apoptotic response. Second, to evaluate the biological effect of the TP53 polymorphism, we established Jurkat isogenic cell lines expressing p53Arg or p53Pro. Jurkat p53Arg cells presented higher DNA damage and higher apoptotic potential than p53Pro cells, after treatment with chemotherapy agents. Only p53Pro cells presented t(15;17) translocation and del(5q). We suggest that failure to repair DNA lesions in p53Arg cells would lead them to apoptosis, whereas some p53Pro cells, prone to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, could undergo misrepair, generating chromosomal abnormalities typical of t-MN. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Image features need to be robust against differences in positioning, acquisition and segmentation to ensure reproducibility. Radiomic models that only include robust features can be used to analyse new images, whereas models with non-robust features may fail to predict the outcome of interest accurately. Test-retest imaging is recommended to assess robustness, but may not be available for the phenotype of interest. We therefore investigated 18 combinations of image perturbations to determine feature robustness, based on noise addition (N), translation (T), rotation (R), volume growth/shrinkage (V) and supervoxel-based contour randomisation (C). Test-retest and perturbation robustness were compared for combined total of 4032 morphological, statistical and texture features that were computed from the gross tumour volume in two cohorts with computed tomography imaging: I) 31 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; II): 19 head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Robustness was determined using the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the intraclass correlation coefficient (1, 1). Features with CI ≥ 0:90 were considered robust. The NTCV, TCV, RNCV and RCV perturbation chain produced similar results and identified the fewest false positive robust features (NSCLC: 0.2–0.9%; HNSCC: 1.7–1.9%). Thus, these perturbation chains may be used as an alternative to test-retest imaging to assess feature robustness. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The upregulation of PPARγ/RXRα transcriptional activity has emerged as a key event in luminal bladder tumors. It renders tumor cell growth PPARγ-dependent and modulates the tumor microenvironment to favor escape from immuno-surveillance. The activation of the pathway has been linked to PPARG gains/amplifications resulting in PPARγ overexpression and to recurrent activating point mutations of RXRα. Here, we report recurrent mutations of PPARγ that also activate the PPARγ/RXRα pathway, conferring PPARγ-dependency and supporting a crucial role of PPARγ in luminal bladder cancer. These mutations are found throughout the protein—including N-terminal, DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains—and most of them enhance protein activity. Structure-function studies of PPARγ variants with mutations in the ligand-binding domain allow identifying structural elements that underpin their gain-of-function. Our study reveals genomic alterations of PPARG that lead to pro-tumorigenic PPARγ/RXRα pathway activation in luminal bladder tumors and may open the way towards alternative options for treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Blood transfusions temporarily improve the physical state of the patient but exert widespread effects on immune and non-immune systems. Perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions (ABT) are associated with various risks, including coagulopathy, incompatibility, transmission of infectious agents, and allergic reactions. Nevertheless, little is known about the global metabolic alterations that reflect the possible reactions of blood transfusions. In this study, we investigated metabolite changes generated by ABT in a rat model using metabolomics technology. To further profile the “metabolome” after blood transfusions, we used both liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight high-definition mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. ABT promoted a stimulatory microenvironment associated with a relative increase in glucose transporter 1/4 (GLUT1/GLUT4) expression. Supporting this result, glucose metabolism-related enzyme IRS1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were abnormally expressed, and levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and its related enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) were significantly altered in allogeneic groups compared to those in autologous groups. Finally, amino acid metabolism was also altered following ABT. Taken together, our results show a difference between autologous and allogeneic blood transfusions and demonstrate correlations with cancer-associated metabolic changes. Our data provide endogenous information for a better understanding of blood transfusion reactions. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly metastatic cancer with very poor prognosis. AMP activated kinase (AMPK) constitutes a candidate to inhibit HCC progression. First, AMPK is downregulated in HCC. Second, glucose starvation induces apoptosis in HCC cells via AMPK. Correspondingly, metformin activates AMPK and inhibits HCC cell proliferation. Nevertheless, the effect of AMPK activation on HCC cell invasiveness remains elusive. Here, migration/invasion was studied in HCC cells exposed to metformin and glucose starvation. Cell viability, proliferation and differentiation, as well as AMPK and PKA activation were analyzed. In addition, invasiveness in mutants of the AMPKα activation loop was assessed. Metformin decreased cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and interference with AMPKα expression avoided metformin actions. Those antitumor effects were potentiated by glucose deprivation. Metformin activated AMPK at the same time that inhibited PKA, and both effects were enhanced by glucose starvation. Given that AMPKα(S173) phosphorylation by PKA decreases AMPK activation, we hypothesized that the reduction of PKA inhibitory effect by metformin could explain the increased antitumor effects observed. Supporting this, in AMPK activating conditions, cell migration/invasion was further impaired in AMPKα(S173C) mutant cells. Metformin emerges as a strong inhibitor of migration/invasion in HCC cells, and glucose restriction potentiates this effect. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "HPV genomic variability and chromosomal integration are important in the HPV-induced carcinogenic process. To uncover these genomic events in an HPV infection, we have developed an innovative and cost-effective sequencing approach named TaME-seq (tagmentation-assisted multiplex PCR enrichment sequencing). TaME-seq combines tagmentation and multiplex PCR enrichment for simultaneous analysis of HPV variation and chromosomal integration, and it can also be adapted to other viruses. For method validation, cell lines (n = 4), plasmids (n = 3), and HPV16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 positive clinical samples (n = 21) were analysed. Our results showed deep HPV genome-wide sequencing coverage. Chromosomal integration breakpoints and large deletions were identified in HPV positive cell lines and in one clinical sample. HPV genomic variability was observed in all samples allowing identification of low frequency variants. In contrast to other approaches, TaME-seq proved to be highly efficient in HPV target enrichment, leading to reduced sequencing costs. Comprehensive studies on HPV intra-host variability generated during a persistent infection will improve our understanding of viral carcinogenesis. Efficient identification of both HPV variability and integration sites will be important for the study of HPV evolution and adaptability and may be an important tool for use in cervical cancer diagnostics. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Biosynthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a key signalling molecule in human (patho)physiology, is mostly accomplished by the human enzymes cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). Several lines of evidence have shown a close correlation between increased H2S production and human diseases, such as several cancer types and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Identifying compounds selectively and potently inhibiting the human H2S-synthesizing enzymes may therefore prove beneficial for pharmacological applications. Here, the human enzymes CBS, CSE and MST were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and thirty-one pyridine derivatives were synthesized and screened for their ability to bind and inhibit these enzymes. Using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), circular dichroism spectropolarimetry (CD), and activity assays based on fluorimetric and colorimetric H2S detection, two compounds (C30 and C31) sharing structural similarities were found to weakly inhibit both CBS and CSE: 1 mM C30 inhibited these enzymes by approx. 50% and 40%, respectively, while 0.5 mM C31 accounted for CBS and CSE inhibition by approx. 40% and 60%, respectively. This work, while presenting a robust methodological platform for screening putative inhibitors of the human H2S-synthesizing enzymes, highlights the importance of employing complementary methodologies in compound screenings. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Phagocytosis is a process in which target cells or particles are engulfed and taken up by other cells, typically professional phagocytes; this process is crucial in many physiological processes and disease states. The detection of targets for phagocytosis is directed by a complex repertoire of cell surface receptors. Pattern recognition receptors directly detect targets for binding and uptake, while opsonic and complement receptors detect objects coated by soluble factors. However, the importance of single and combinatorial surface marker expression across different phenotypes of professional phagocytes is not known. Here we developed a novel mass cytometry-based phagocytosis assay that enables the simultaneous detection of phagocytic events in combination with up to 40 other protein markers. We applied this assay to distinct monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) populations and found that prototypic M2-like MDMs phagocytose more E. coli than M1-like MDMs. Surface markers such as CD14, CD206, and CD163 rendered macrophages phagocytosis competent, but only CD209 directly correlated with the amount of particle uptake. Similarly, M2-like MDMs also phagocytosed more cancer cells than M1-like MDMs but, unlike M1-like MDMs, were insensitive to anti-CD47 opsonization. Our approach facilitates the simultaneous study of single-cell phenotypes, phagocytic activity, signaling and transcriptional events in complex cell mixtures. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Vertebrate fetuins are multi-domain plasma-proteins of the cystatin-superfamily. Human fetuin-A is also known as AHSG, α2-Heremans-Schmid-glycoprotein. Gene-knockout in mice identified fetuin-A as essential for calcified-matrix-metabolism and bone-mineralization. Fetuin-B deficient mice, on the other hand, are female infertile due to zona pellucida ‘hardening’ caused by the metalloproteinase ovastacin in unfertilized oocytes. In wildtype mice fetuin-B inhibits the activity of ovastacin thus maintaining oocytes fertilizable. Here we asked, if fetuins affect further proteases as might be expected from their evolutionary relation to single-domain-cystatins, known as proteinase-inhibitors. We show that fetuin-A is not an inhibitor of any tested protease. In stark contrast, the closely related fetuin-B selectively inhibits astacin-metalloproteinases such as meprins and ovastacin, but not astacins of the tolloid-subfamily, nor any other proteinase. The analysis of fetuin-B expressed in various mammalian cell types, insect cells, and truncated fish-fetuin expressed in bacteria, showed that the cystatin-like domains alone are necessary and sufficient for inhibition. This report highlights fetuin-B as a specific antagonist of ovastacin and meprin-metalloproteinases. Control of ovastacin was shown to be indispensable for female fertility. Meprin inhibition, on the other hand, renders fetuin-B a potential key-player in proteolytic networks controlling angiogenesis, immune-defense, extracellular-matrix-assembly and general cell-signaling, with implications for inflammation, fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that regulates fibrinolysis, cell adhesion and cell motility via its interactions with plasminogen activators and vitronectin. PAI-1 has been shown to play a role in a number of diverse pathologies including cardiovascular diseases, obesity and cancer and is therefore an attractive therapeutic target. However the multiple patho-physiological roles of PAI-1, and understanding the relative contributions of these in any one disease setting, make the development of therapeutically relevant molecules challenging. Here we describe the identification and characterisation of fully human antibody MEDI-579, which binds with high affinity and specificity to the active form of human PAI-1. MEDI-579 specifically inhibits serine protease interactions with PAI-1 while conserving vitronectin binding. Crystallographic analysis reveals that this specificity is achieved through direct binding of MEDI-579 Fab to the reactive centre loop (RCL) of PAI-1 and at the same exosite used by both tissue and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA). We propose that MEDI-579 acts by directly competing with proteases for RCL binding and as such is able to modulate the interaction of PAI-1 with tPA and uPA in a way not previously described for a human PAI-1 inhibitor. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Exhibiting a red-shifted absorption/scattering feature compared to conventional plasmonic metals, titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) look as very promising candidates for biomedical applications, but these applications are still underexplored despite the presence of extensive data for conventional plasmonic counterparts. Here, we report the fabrication of ultrapure, size-tunable TiN NPs by methods of femtosecond laser ablation in liquids and their biological testing. We show that TiN NPs demonstrate strong and broad plasmonic peak around 640–700 nm with a significant tail over 800 nm even for small NPs sizes (<7 nm). In vitro tests of laser-synthesized TiN NPs on cellular models evidence their low cytotoxicity and excellent cell uptake. We finally demonstrate a strong photothermal therapy effect on U87–MG cancer cell cultures using TiN NPs as sensitizers of local hyperthermia under near-infrared laser excitation. Based on absorption band in the region of relative tissue transparency and acceptable biocompatibility, laser-synthesized TiN NPs promise the advancement of biomedical modalities employing plasmonic effects, including absorption/scattering contrast imaging, photothermal therapy, photoacoustic imaging and SERS. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Fragile histidine triad (FHIT) serves a critical function as a tumor suppressor that inhibits p53 degradation by mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). The functional domains of FHIT involved in tumor inhibition was interpreted. In-silico screening data were employed to construct truncated forms of FHIT to assess their cytotoxic effects on the HT1080 cell line. Full FHIT expression was confirmed by western blotting and expression of two FHIT truncates were confirmed by RT-PCR. Transfection of these truncated forms into HT1080 cells showed that the N-terminal truncated form (amino acids 17-102) better inhibited proliferation than the full-length FHIT. The combined effects of these truncated forms augmented doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Functional analysis demonstrated that these fragments and their combination with doxorubicin can arrest cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle as specified by flow cytometry. The FHIT functional domains can be used as lead compounds for development of drug designs and gene transfer for cancer therapy. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Generating a protective and long-lasting immune response is the primary goal in the expanding field of immunotherapeutic research. In current study we designed an immunogenic bacteriophage- based vaccine to induce a cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity against a mice tumor model over-expressing HER2/neu. Bacteriophage λ displaying a HER2/neu derived peptide GP2 was constructed and used as an anti-cancer vaccine in a BALB/c mouse xenograft tumor model. The results of our study indicated that phage nanoparticles displaying GP2 as a fused peptide to the gpD phage capsid protein induced a robust CTL response. Furthermore, the chimeric phage nanoparticles protected mice against HER2/neu-positive tumor challenge in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. In conclusion, we propose that λ phage nanoparticles decorated with GP2 peptide merit further investigation for the development of peptide-based vaccines against HER2/neu overexpressing tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The first step in the development of human colorectal cancer is aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt signaling hyperactivation is predominantly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that encodes the pathway negative regulator. In order to identify genes affected by the Apc loss, we performed expression profiling of intestinal epithelium isolated from mice harboring a conditional Apc allele. The gene encoding transcriptional factor msh homeobox 1 (Msx1) displayed robust upregulation upon Apc inactivation. Histological analysis of the Apc-deficient epithelium revealed that in the small intestine, the Msx1 protein was localized exclusively in ectopic crypts, i.e., in pockets of proliferating cells abnormally positioned on the villi. Ablation of the Msx1 gene leads to the disappearance of ectopic crypts and loss of differentiated cells. Moreover, tumors arising from Msx1-deficient cells display altered morphology reminiscent of villous adenomas. In human tumor specimens, MSX1 displayed significantly increased expression in colonic neoplasia with a descending tendency during the lesion progression towards colorectal carcinoma. In summary, the results indicate that Msx1 represents a novel marker of intestinal tumorigenesis. In addition, we described the previously unknown relationship between the Msx1-dependent formation of ectopic crypts and cell differentiation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy is used in >50% of patients with cancer, both for curative and palliative purposes. Radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation to target and kill tumour tissue, but normal tissue can also be damaged, leading to toxicity. Modern and precise radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, may prevent toxicity, but some patients still experience adverse effects. The physiopathology of toxicity is dependent on many parameters, such as the location of irradiation or the functional status of organs at risk. Knowledge of the mechanisms leads to a more rational approach for controlling radiotherapy toxicity, which may result in improved symptom control and quality of life for patients. This improved quality of life is particularly important in paediatric patients, who may live for many years with the long-term effects of radiotherapy. Notably, signs and symptoms occurring after radiotherapy may not be due to the treatment but to an exacerbation of existing conditions or to the development of new diseases. Although differential diagnosis may be difficult, it has important consequences for patients. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests a potential role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels in inflammatory and cancer-related pain. However, the role of TRPV1 in the maintenance of neuropathic pain remains elusive. The current study investigated the effects of transient Trpv1 gene silencing using a small interference RNA (siRNA) on neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats. Seven days after CCI, the TRPV1 siRNA was intrathecally administered (5 µg/15 µl, once daily for 2 days). TRPV1 and Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in the spinal cord were detected using western blotting. The thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli were determined before and after intrathecal TRPV1 siRNA administration. TRPV1 and CAMKII expression and ERK2 phosphorylation in the spinal cord were upregulated after CCI. Intrathecal administration of the TRPV1 siRNA not only attenuated behavioural hyperalgesia but also reduced the expression of TRPV1 and CAMKII, as well as ERK2 phosphorylation. Based on these results, silencing of the TRPV1 gene in the spinal cord attenuates the maintenance of neuropathic pain by inhibiting CAMKII/ERK2 activation and suggests that TRPV1 represents a potential target in pain therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Diffuse astrocytoma (including glioblastoma) is morbid with a worse prognosis than other types of glioma. Therefore, we sought to build a progression-associated score to improve malignancy and prognostic predictions for astrocytoma. The astrocytoma progression (AP) score was constructed through bioinformatics analyses of the training cohort (TCGA RNA-seq) and included 18 genes representing distinct aspects of regulation during astrocytoma progression. This classifier could successfully discriminate patients with distinct prognoses in the training and validation (REMBRANDT, GSE16011 and TCGA-GBM Microarray) cohorts (P < 0.05 in all cohorts) and in different clinicopathological subgroups. Distinct patterns of somatic mutations and copy number variation were also observed. The bioinformatics analyses suggested that genes associated with a higher AP score were significantly involved in cancer progression-related biological processes, such as the cell cycle and immune/inflammatory responses, whereas genes associated with a lower AP score were associated with relatively normal nervous system biological processes. The analyses indicated that the AP score was a robust predictor of patient survival, and its ability to predict astrocytoma malignancy was well elucidated. Therefore, this bioinformatics-based scoring system suggested that astrocytoma progression could distinguish patients with different underlying biological processes and clinical outcomes, facilitate more precise tumour grading and possibly shed light on future classification strategies and therapeutics for astrocytoma patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Whether patients with glioblastoma that contacts the ventricular-subventricular zone stem cell niche (VSVZ + GBM) have a distinct survival profile from VSVZ − GBM patients independent of other known predictors or molecular profiles is unclear. Using multivariate Cox analysis to adjust survival for widely-accepted predictors, hazard ratios (HRs) for overall (OS) and progression free (PFS) survival between VSVZ + GBM and VSVZ − GBM patients were calculated in 170 single-institution patients and 254 patients included in both The Cancer Genome (TCGA) and Imaging (TCIA) atlases. An adjusted, multivariable analysis revealed that VSVZ contact was independently associated with decreased survival in both datasets. TCGA molecular data analyses revealed that VSVZ contact by GBM was independent of mutational, DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein expression signatures in the bulk tumor. Therefore, while survival of GBM patients is independently stratified by VSVZ contact, with VSVZ + GBM patients displaying a poor prognosis, the VSVZ + GBMs do not possess a distinct molecular signature at the bulk sample level. Focused examination of the interplay between the VSVZ microenvironment and subsets of GBM cells proximal to this region is warranted. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) derived parameters can identify oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and lymphatic metastasis. Thirty-nine oesophageal SCC patients underwent DCE-MRI. Quantitative parameters including endothelial transfer constant (K trans ), reflux rate (K ep ), fractional extravascular extracellular space volume and fractional plasma volume, and semi-quantitative parameters including time to peak (TTP), max concentration, Max Slope and area under concentration-time curve of both oesophageal SCC and normal oesophagus were measured. Mann-Whitney U test revealed that K trans and K ep of oesophageal SCC were higher while TTP was shorter when compared to normal oesophagus (all P-values &lt; 0.05); and areas under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves displayed that K ep was superior to TTP or K trans for identifying oesophageal SCC (0.903 vs. 0.832 or 0.713). Mann-Whitney U test also demonstrated that K ep was higher and TTP was shorter in patients with lymphatic metastasis when compared to non-metastatic cancer patients (both P-values &lt; 0.05), and area under ROC curve also showed that TTP was superior to K ep for predicting lymphatic metastasis (0.696 vs. 0.659). In conclusion, the combination of quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters derived from DCE-MRI can aid in the identification of oesophageal SCC and lymphatic metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "GSK3α has been identified as a new target in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, most GSK3 inhibitors lack specificity for GSK3α over GSK3β and other kinases. We have previously shown in lung cancer cells that GSK3α and to a lesser extent GSK3β are inhibited by the advanced clinical candidate tivantinib (ARQ197), which was designed as a MET inhibitor. Thus, we hypothesized that tivantinib would be an effective therapy for the treatment of AML. Here, we show that tivantinib has potent anticancer activity across several AML cell lines and primary patient cells. Tivantinib strongly induced apoptosis, differentiation and G2/M cell cycle arrest and caused less undesirable stabilization of β-catenin compared to the pan-GSK3 inhibitor LiCl. Subsequent drug combination studies identified the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 to synergize with tivantinib while cytarabine combination with tivantinib was antagonistic. Interestingly, the addition of ABT-199 to tivantinib completely abrogated tivantinib induced β-catenin stabilization. Tivantinib alone, or in combination with ABT-199, downregulated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-XL levels, which likely contribute to the observed synergy. Importantly, tivantinib as single agent or in combination with ABT-199 significantly inhibited the colony forming capacity of primary patient AML bone marrow mononuclear cells. In summary, tivantinib is a novel GSK3α/β inhibitor that potently kills AML cells and tivantinib single agent or combination therapy with ABT-199 may represent attractive new therapeutic opportunities for AML. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Appropriate interventions might improve the prevention of essential hypertension. This requires a comprehensive view of modifiable lifestyle factors (MLFs) distribution and effect. To determine how six MLFs (general adiposity, abdominal adiposity, alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, physical inactivity) for risk of hypertension are distributed and how their combinations affect the risk, a prospective study cohort of 11,923 healthy participants from the population-based European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)–Potsdam Study was used. Of these, 1,635 developed hypertension during a mean follow-up of 10.3 years. Mutually exclusive combinations, clustering and interactions of MLFs were then investigated stratifying by sex, Hazard Ratios (HRs) and Population Attributable Risks (PARs%) were calculated. General adiposity alone was sufficient to increase the risk of hypertension (HR = 1.86, PAR% 3.36), and in this cohort it played a major role in enhancing the risk of hypertension, together with smoking and physical inactivity. MLFs had a different impact and a different modulation of risk in women and men, and they showed a remarkable tendency to occur in specific patterns with higher prevalence than expected. This indication can help to promote a holistic approach through multifactorial preventive strategies addressing more than a factor at a time. For prevention of hypertension addressing adiposity together with smoking, promoting at the same time physical activity should be the first choice. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bcl9 and Pygo are Wnt enhanceosome components that effect β-catenin-dependent transcription. Whether they mediate β-catenin-dependent neoplasia is unclear. Here we assess their roles in intestinal tumourigenesis initiated by Apc loss-of-function (Apc Min ), or by Apc 1322T encoding a partially-functional Apc truncation commonly found in colorectal carcinomas. Intestinal deletion of Bcl9 extends disease-free survival in both models, and essentially cures Apc 1322T mice of their neoplasia. Loss-of-Bcl9 synergises with loss-of-Pygo to shift gene expression within Apc-mutant adenomas from stem cell-like to differentiation along Notch-regulated secretory lineages. Bcl9 loss also promotes tumour retention in Apc Min mice, apparently via relocating nuclear β-catenin to the cell surface, but this undesirable effect is not seen in Apc 1322T mice whose Apc truncation retains partial function in regulating β-catenin. Our results demonstrate a key role of the Wnt enhanceosome in β-catenin-dependent intestinal tumourigenesis and reveal the potential of BCL9 as a therapeutic target during early stages of colorectal cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment limits the success of current immunotherapies. The host retains memory T cells specific for previous infections throughout the entire body that are capable of executing potent and immediate immunostimulatory functions. Here we show that virus-specific memory T cells extend their surveillance to mouse and human tumors. Reactivating these antiviral T cells can arrest growth of checkpoint blockade-resistant and poorly immunogenic tumors in mice after injecting adjuvant-free non-replicating viral peptides into tumors. Peptide mimics a viral reinfection event to memory CD8+ T cells, triggering antigen presentation and cytotoxic pathways within the tumor, activating dendritic cells and natural killer cells, and recruiting the adaptive immune system. Viral peptide treatment of ex vivo human tumors recapitulates immune activation gene expression profiles observed in mice. Lastly, peptide therapy renders resistant mouse tumors susceptible to PD-L1 blockade. Thus, re-stimulating known antiviral immunity may provide a unique therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Galectin-3 is a carbohydrate binding protein which has important roles in cancer and immunity. Potent galectin-3 inhibitors have been synthesized, for experimental purposes and potential clinical use. As galectin-3 is implicated in both intra- and extracellular activities, permeability of galectin-3 inhibitors is an important parameter determining biological effects. We compared the cellular uptake of galectin-3 inhibitors and their potency in the intracellular or extracellular space. The inhibitors differed in their polar surface area (PSA), but had similar affinities for galectin-3. Using a well-established permeability assay, we confirmed that the uptake was significantly higher for the inhibitor with the lowest PSA, as expected. To analyze intracellular activity of the inhibitors, we developed a novel assay based on galectin-3 accumulation around damaged intracellular vesicles. The results show striking differences between the inhibitors intracellular potency, correlating with their PSAs. To test extracellular activity of the inhibitors, we analyzed their potency to block binding of galectin-3 to cell surfaces. All inhibitors were equally able to block galectin-3 binding to cells and this was proportional to their affinity for galectin-3. These inhibitors may serve as useful tools in exploring biological roles of galectin-3 and may further our understanding of intracellular versus extracellular roles of galectin-3. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Sex bias in innate defense against Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is dependent on both estrogen production by the host and S. aureus secretion of the virulence factor, α-hemolysin (Hla). The impact of estrogen signaling on the immune system is most often studied in terms of the nuclear estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. However, the potential contribution of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) to innate defense against infectious disease, particularly with respect to skin infection, has not been addressed. Using a murine model of SSTI, we found that GPER activation with the highly selective agonist G-1 limits S. aureus SSTI and Hla-mediated pathogenesis, effects that were absent in GPER knockout mice. Specifically, G-1 reduced Hla-mediated skin lesion formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, while increasing bacterial clearance. In vitro, G-1 reduced surface expression of the Hla receptor, ADAM10, in a human keratinocyte cell line and increased resistance to Hla-mediated permeability barrier disruption. This novel role for GPER activation in skin innate defense against infectious disease suggests that G-1 may have clinical utility in patients with epithelial permeability barrier dysfunction or who are otherwise at increased risk of S. aureus infection, including those with atopic dermatitis or cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is closely correlated with diverse cardiovascular diseases, augmenting the risk of heart failure and sudden death. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been studied in cardiac hypertrophy for their regulatory function. LncRNA MEG3 has been reported in human cancers. Whereas, it is unknown whether MEG3 regulates the growth of cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the specific role of MEG3 in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we found that MEG3 contributed to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. MEG3 expression was remarkably strengthened in the mice heart which undergone the transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that MEG3 was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes which were treated with Ang-II. Silenced MEG3 inhibited the increasing size of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and reversed other hypertrophic responses. Mechanically, MEG3 could affect cardiac hypertrophy by regulating gene expression. Mechanically, we found that MEG3 could be upregulated by the transcription factor STAT3 and could regulate miR-361-5p and HDAC9 by acting as a ceRNA. Finally, rescue assays were made to do further confirmation. All our findings revealed that STAT3-inducetd upregulation of lncRNA MEG3 controls cardiac hypertrophy by regulating miR-362-5p/HDAC9 axis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are responsible for the immunologic tolerance of liver which is a common site for visceral metastases, suggesting its potential role as an target for cancer immunotherapy. However, targeted modulation of LSECs is still not achieved thus far. Here, we report LSECs are specifically targeted and modulated by melittin nanoparticles (α-melittin-NPs). Intravital imaging shows that LSECs fluoresce within 20 s after intravenous injection of α-melittin-NPs. α-melittin-NPs trigger the activation of LSECs and lead to dramatic changes of cytokine/chemokine milieu in the liver, which switches the hepatic immunologic environment to the activated state. As a result, α-melittin-NPs resist the formation of metastatic lesions with high efficiency. More strikingly, the survival rate reaches 80% in the spontaneous liver metastatic tumor model. Our research provides support for the use of α-melittin-NPs to break LSEC-mediated immunologic tolerance, which opens an avenue to control liver metastasis through the immunomodulation of LSECs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite significant progress, our understanding of how specific oncogenes transform cells is still limited and likely underestimates the complexity of downstream signalling events. To address this gap, we use mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics to characterize the global impact of an oncogene on the expressed kinome, and then functionally annotate the regulated kinases. As an example, we identify 63 protein kinases exhibiting altered expression and/or phosphorylation in Src-transformed mammary epithelial cells. An integrated siRNA screen identifies nine kinases, including SGK1, as being essential for Src-induced transformation. Accordingly, we find that Src positively regulates SGK1 expression in triple negative breast cancer cells, which exhibit a prominent signalling network governed by Src family kinases. Furthermore, combined inhibition of Src and SGK1 reduces colony formation and xenograft growth more effectively than either treatment alone. Therefore, this approach not only provides mechanistic insights into oncogenic transformation but also aids the design of improved therapeutic strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating data indicates that some cancer treatments can restore anticancer immunosurveillance through the induction of tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD). Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) have been shown to efficiently ablate melanoma tumors. In this study we investigated the mechanisms and immunogenicity of nsPEF-induced cell death in B16F10 melanoma tumors. Our data show that in vitro nsPEF (20–200, 200-ns pulses, 7 kV/cm, 2 Hz) caused a rapid dose-dependent cell death which was not accompanied by caspase activation or PARP cleavage. The lack of nsPEF-induced apoptosis was confirmed in vivo in B16F10 tumors. NsPEF also failed to trigger ICD-linked responses such as necroptosis and autophagy. Our results point at necrosis as the primary mechanism of cell death induced by nsPEF in B16F10 cells. We finally compared the antitumor immunity in animals treated with nsPEF (750, 200-ns, 25 kV/cm, 2 Hz) with animals were tumors were surgically removed. Compared to the naïve group where all animals developed tumors, nsPEF and surgery protected 33% (6/18) and 28.6% (4/14) of the animals, respectively. Our data suggest that, under our experimental conditions, the local ablation by nsPEF restored but did not boost the natural antitumor immunity which stays dormant in the tumor-bearing host. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "There is an association between smoking and cancer, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. However, currently, there are no affordable and informative tests for assessing the effects of smoking on the rate of biological aging. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that smoking status can be predicted using blood biochemistry and cell count results andthe recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By employing age-prediction models developed using supervised deep learning techniques, we found that smokers exhibited higher aging rates than nonsmokers, regardless of their cholesterol ratios and fasting glucose levels. We further used those models to quantify the acceleration of biological aging due to tobacco use. Female smokers were predicted to be twice as old as their chronological age compared to nonsmokers, whereas male smokers were predicted to be one and a half times as old as their chronological age compared to nonsmokers. Our findings suggest that deep learning analysis of routine blood tests could complement or even replace the current error-prone method of self-reporting of smoking status and could be expanded to assess the effect of other lifestyle and environmental factors on aging. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Osteosarcomas are characterized by highly disrupted genomes. Although osteosarcomas lack common fusions, we find evidence of many tumour specific gene-gene fusion transcripts, likely due to chromosomal rearrangements and expression of transcription-induced chimeras. Most of the fusions result in out-of-frame transcripts, potentially capable of producing long novel protein sequences and a plethora of neoantigens. To identify fusions, we explored RNA-sequencing data to obtain detailed knowledge of transcribed fusions, by creating a novel program to compare fusions identified by deFuse to de novo transcripts generated by Trinity. This allowed us to confirm the deFuse results and identify unusual splicing patterns associated with fusion events. Using various existing tools combined with this custom program, we developed a pipeline for the identification of fusion transcripts applicable as targets for immunotherapy. In addition to identifying candidate neoantigens associated with fusions, we were able to use the pipeline to establish a method for measuring the frequency of fusion events, which correlated to patient outcome, as well as highlight some similarities between canine and human osteosarcomas. The results of this study of osteosarcomas underscores the numerous benefits associated with conducting a thorough analysis of fusion events within cancer samples. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Sex-stratified medicine is a fundamentally important, yet understudied, facet of modern medical care. A data-driven model for how to systematically analyze population-wide, longitudinal differences in hospital admissions between men and women is needed. Here, we demonstrate a systematic analysis of all diseases and disease co-occurrences in the complete Danish population using the ICD-10 and Global Burden of Disease terminologies. Incidence rates of single diagnoses are different for men and women in most cases. The age at first diagnosis is typically lower for men, compared to women. Men and women share many disease co-occurrences. However, many sex-associated incongruities not linked directly to anatomical or genomic differences are also found. Analysis of multi-step trajectories uncover differences in longitudinal patterns, for example concerning injuries and substance abuse, cancer, and osteoporosis. The results point towards the need for an increased focus on sex-stratified medicine to elucidate the origins of the socio-economic and ethological differences. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The proprotein convertase PACE4 has been validated as a potential target to develop new therapeutic interventions in prostate cancer (PCa). So far, the most effective compound blocking the activity of this enzyme has been designed based on the structure of a small peptide Ac-LLLLRVKR-NH 2 known as the Multi-Leu (ML) peptide. Optimization of this scaffold led to the synthesis of compound C23 (Ac-[DLeu]LLLRVK-amidinobenzylamide) with a potent in vivo inhibitory effect on the tumor growth. However, further developments of PACE4 inhibitors may require additional improvements to counter their rapid renal clearance and to increase their tumor targeting efficiency. Herein, we explored the transformation of the ML-peptide into an albumin-binding prodrug containing a tumor specific release mechanism based on the prostate-specific antigen. Our data confirms that intravenous treatment using the ML-peptide alone has little effect on tumor growth, whereas by using the ML-prodrug in LNCaP xenograft-bearing mice it was significantly reduced. Additionally, excellent in vivo stability and tumor-targeting efficiency was demonstrated using a radiolabelled version of this compound. Taken together, these results provide a solid foundation for further development of targeted PACE4 inhibition in PCa. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) catalyzing the formation of asymmetric dimethylarginines has been implicated in cancer development, metastasis, and prognosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of low PRMT1 levels on a non-MYCN amplified neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. Stable PRMT1-knockdown (PRMT1-KD) cells showed reduced growth rates and cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M. They also exhibited senescent phenotypes and increased p53 expression. p21 and PAI-1, which are two p53 downstream targets critical for senescence, were significantly induced in SK-N-SH cells subjected to either PRMT1-KD or inhibitor treatment. The induction was suppressed by a p53 inhibitor and marginal in a p53-null SK-N-AS cell line, suggesting dependence on p53. In general, the DNA damage and ROS levels of the PRMT1-KD SK-N-SH cells were slightly increased. Their migration activity also increased with the induction of PAI-1. Thus, PRMT1 downregulation released the repression of cellular senescence and migration activity in SK-N-SH cells. These results might partially explain the poor prognostic outcome of low PRMT1 in a non-MYCN-amplified cohort and indicate the multifaceted complexity of PRMT1 as a biological regulator of neuroblastoma. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In Drosophila, a complex consisting of Calypso and ASX catalyzes H2A deubiquitination and has been reported to act as part of the Polycomb machinery in transcriptional silencing. The mammalian homologs of these proteins (BAP1 and ASXL1/2/3, respectively), are frequently mutated in various cancer types, yet their precise functions remain unclear. Using an integrative approach based on isogenic cell lines generated with CRISPR/Cas9, we uncover an unanticipated role for BAP1 in gene activation. This function requires the assembly of an enzymatically active BAP1-associated core complex (BAP1.com) containing one of the redundant ASXL proteins. We investigate the mechanism underlying BAP1.com-mediated transcriptional regulation and show that it does not participate in Polycomb-mediated silencing. Instead, our results establish that the function of BAP1.com is to safeguard transcriptionally active genes against silencing by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Faithful chromosome segregation requires proper chromosome congression at prometaphase and dynamic maintenance of the aligned chromosomes at metaphase. Chromosome missegregation can result in aneuploidy, birth defects and cancer. The kinetochore-bound KMN network and the kinesin motor CENP-E are critical for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome stability. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) attaches linear ubiquitin chains to substrates, with well-established roles in immune response. Here, we identify LUBAC as a key player of chromosome alignment during mitosis. LUBAC catalyzes linear ubiquitination of the kinetochore motor CENP-E, which is specifically required for the localization of CENP-E at attached kinetochores, but not unattached ones. KNL1 acts as a receptor of linear ubiquitin chains to anchor CENP-E at attached kinetochores in prometaphase and metaphase. Thus, linear ubiquitination promotes chromosome congression and dynamic chromosome alignment by coupling the dynamic kinetochore microtubule receptor CENP-E to the static one, the KMN network. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Clinical data acquired over the last decade on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment with small molecular weight Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have shown significant influence of EGFR point mutations and in-frame deletions on clinical efficacy. Identification of small molecules capable of inhibiting the clinically relevant EGFR mutant forms is desirable, and novel chemical scaffolds might provide knowledge regarding selectivity among EGFR forms and shed light on new strategies to overcome current clinical limitations. Design, synthesis, docking studies and in vitro evaluation of N-(3-(3-phenylureido)quinoxalin-6-yl) acrylamide derivatives (7a-m) against EGFR mutant forms are described. Compounds 7h and 7l were biochemically active in the nanomolar range against EGFRwt and EGFRL858R. Molecular docking and reaction enthalpy calculations have shown the influence of the combination of reversible and covalent binding modes with EGFR on the inhibitory activity. The inhibitory profile of 7h against a panel of patient-derived tumor cell lines was established, demonstrating selective growth inhibition of EGFR related cells at 10 μM among a panel of 30 cell lines derived from colon, melanoma, breast, bladder, kidney, prostate, pancreas and ovary tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "CD133 is a transmembranous protein that mainly localises to the plasma membrane in haematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as cancer stem cells. Although CD133 also localises to the cytoplasm, the mechanism of action and function of cytoplasmic CD133 currently remain unknown. We herein demonstrated that when Src family kinase activity is weak, CD133 interacts with HDAC6 and is transported to the pericentrosomal region after internalization and endosome formation via the dynein-based traffic system. Pericentrosomal CD133 is then recycled to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. At the pericentrosomal region, endosomal CD133 captures GABARAP, an initiator of autophagy, and inhibits GABARAP-mediated ULK1 activation and the subsequent initiation of autophagy. Furthermore, pericentrosomal CD133 suppresses cell differentiation, such as primary cilium formation and neurite outgrowth, by inhibiting autophagy. Thus, the present results provide evidence to suggest that pericentrosomal CD133 has the unique property of maintaining the undifferentiated status of cells by inhibiting autophagy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Under hypoxia, most of glucose is converted to secretory lactate, which leads to the overuse of glutamine-carbon. However, under such a condition how glutamine nitrogen is disposed to avoid over-accumulating ammonia remains to be determined. Here we identify a metabolic flux of glutamine to secretory dihydroorotate, which is indispensable to glutamine-carbon metabolism under hypoxia. We found that glutamine nitrogen is necessary to nucleotide biosynthesis, but enriched in dihyroorotate and orotate rather than processing to its downstream uridine monophosphate under hypoxia. Dihyroorotate, not orotate, is then secreted out of cells. Furthermore, we found that the specific metabolic pathway occurs in vivo and is required for tumor growth. The identified metabolic pathway renders glutamine mainly to acetyl coenzyme A for lipogenesis, with the rest carbon and nitrogen being safely removed. Therefore, our results reveal how glutamine carbon and nitrogen are coordinatively metabolized under hypoxia, and provide a comprehensive understanding on glutamine metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Serine proteases have been implicated as key drivers and facilitators of lung cancer malignancy, and while these proteins represent straightforward targets for therapeutic inhibitors, identification of optimal points for intervention has been complicated by the complex networks in which these enzymes function. Here we implicate a signaling pathway consisting of PRSS3/mesotrypsin and kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) in lung adenocarcinoma malignancy. We show that elevated PRSS3/mesotrypsin expression is prognostic for poor outcome for patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and that genetic or pharmacologic targeting of PRSS3/mesotrypsin reduces lung adenocarcinoma cell invasiveness and proliferation. We further show that genetic targeting of KLK5, a known target of PRSS3/mesotrypsin, phenocopies the effect of PRSS3/mesotrypsin knockdown, and also that elevated expression of KLK5 is similarly prognostic for outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, we use transcriptional profiling experiments to show that PRSS3/mesotrypsin and KLK5 control a common malignancy-promoting pathway. These experiments implicate a potential PRSS3/mesotrypsin-KLK5 signaling module in lung adenocarcinoma and reveal the potential therapeutic benefit of selectively targeting these pathways. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising method for detecting cancer margins during tumor resection. This study focused on differentiating tumorous from nontumorous tissues in human brain tissues using cross-polarization OCT (CP OCT). The study was performed on fresh ex vivo human brain tissues from 30 patients with high- and low-grade gliomas. Different tissue types that neurosurgeons should clearly distinguish during surgery, such as the cortex, white matter, necrosis and tumorous tissue, were separately analyzed. Based on volumetric CP OCT data, tumorous and normal brain tissue were differentiated using two optical coefficients — attenuation and forward cross-scattering. Compared with white matter, tumorous tissue without necrotic areas had significantly lower optical attenuation and forward cross-scattering values. The presence of particular morphological patterns, such as necrosis and injured myelinated fibers, can lead to dramatic changes in coefficient values and create some difficulties in differentiating between tissues. Color-coded CP OCT maps based on optical coefficients provided a visual assessment of the tissue. This study demonstrated the high translational potential of CP OCT in differentiating tumorous tissue from white matter. The clinical use of CP OCT during surgery in patients with gliomas could increase the extent of tumor resection and improve overall and progression-free survival. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic disorder involving benign mass formation due to fibrosis and intense lymphoplasmacytosis; the chronic inflammation associated with the disease might also contribute to oncogenesis. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), normally expressed in germinal centre activated B-cells, is an enzyme that edits DNA/RNA and induces somatic hypermutation and Ig class switching. AID expression is strictly controlled under physiological conditions; however, chronic inflammation and some infectious agents induce its up-regulation. AID is overexpressed in various cancers and may be important in chronic inflammation-associated oncogenesis. We examined AID expression in IgG4-related sialadenitis (n = 14), sialolithiasis (non-specific inflammation, n = 13), and normal submandibular glands (n = 13) using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly more AID-expressing cells in IgG4-related sialadenitis than in sialolithiasis or normal submandibular gland samples (P = 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively); qPCR yielded similar results. Thus, AID was significantly more up-regulated and had higher expression in extra-germinal centres in IgG4-RD than in non-specific inflammation or normal conditions. This report suggests that IgG4-RD has several specific causes of AID up-regulation in addition to inflammation. Furthermore, chronic inflammation-associated AID-mediated oncogenesis is possible in IgG4-RD. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ajwa dates (Phoenix dactylifera L.) are used by traditional therapeutic practitioners for several health benefits but most remain to be scientifically validated. In this study, we evaluated the apoptosis-inducing effect of ethanolic extract of Ajwa date pulp (ADP) on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells. High performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed the presence of polysaccharide β-D-glucan in ADP extract. Treated HCC cells revealed morphological characteristics of apoptosis under phase contrast microscopy. MTT assay demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) dose- and time-dependent inhibition of HCC cell growth. HCC cells were found to be in late apoptotic stage on treatment with higher doses of ADP extract as depicted by acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Annexin V-FITC/PI double stain. Importantly, ADP extract increased the reactive oxygen species level and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in treated HCC cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that ADP extract induced elevation of S and G2/M phases of cell cycle. Moreover, ADP extract induced apoptosis in HCC cells independent of tumor suppressor genes viz. CHEK2, ATM and TP53. Interestingly, ADP extract did not display any significant effect on normal cell line Vero. This study provides validation that ADP extract can be considered as a safe and natural potential drug candidate against human liver cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This study assessed if race and gender predict known sexual risk factors associated with HPV. Data (n = 301) were from a cross-sectional study conducted at a drag racing event on September 12–13, 2015 in Madison, Illinois. Both multivariable logistic and linear regression models estimated the association between race, gender, and sexual risk factors. About 63% of participants were males, and 65% identified as Blacks. Compared to females, males were more likely to have a higher number of oral sexual partners (OR = 2.10; 95% CI: 1.23, 3.57). Males were also more likely to have earlier oral sexual (b = −2.10; 95% CI: −3.60, −0.60) and vaginal sexual (b = −1.10; 95% CI: −1.69, −0.31) debuts compared to females. Blacks were more likely to have higher number of vaginal sexual partners (OR = 3.38; 95% CI: 1.81, 6.31) and earlier vaginal sex (b = −1.09; 95% CI: −1.78, −0.41) but less likely to have earlier oral sexual debuts compared with Whites (b = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.21, −4.13). Because HPV is associated with several cancers, our findings provide impetus for the development of targeted educational interventions aimed at improving the knowledge of these sexual risk factors, especially among men and across race groups. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that allows for transferrin-bound iron uptake in mammalian cells. It is overexpressed in various cancers to satisfy the high iron demand of fast proliferating cells. Here we show that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) TFR1 expression is regulated by miR-148a. Within the TFR1 3′UTR we identified and experimentally validated two evolutionarily conserved miRNA response elements (MREs) for miR-148/152 family members, including miR-148a. Interestingly, analyses of RNA sequencing data from patients with liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) revealed a significant inverse correlation of TFR1 mRNA levels and miR-148a. In addition, TFR1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the tumor compared to matched normal healthy tissue, while miR-148a levels are decreased. Functional analysis demonstrated post-transcriptional regulation of TFR1 by miR-148a in HCC cells as well as decreased HCC cell proliferation upon either miR-148a overexpression or TFR1 knockdown. We hypothesize that decreased expression of miR-148a in HCC may elevate transferrin-bound iron uptake, increasing cellular iron levels and cell proliferation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "p53 is frequently mutated in human cancers. Its levels are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. The complex between MDM2 and p53 is largely formed by the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain of p53 (residues 15–29). We investigated the kinetic and thermodynamic basis of the MDM2/p53 interaction by using wild-type and mutant variants of the TA domain. We focus on the effects of phosphorylation at positions Thr18 and Ser20 including their substitution with phosphomimetics. Conformational propensities of the isolated peptides were investigated using in silico methods and experimentally by circular dichroism and 1H-NMR in aqueous solution. Both experimental and computational analyses indicate that the p53 peptides are mainly disordered in aqueous solution, with evidence of nascent helix around the Ser20-Leu25 region. Both phosphorylation and the phosphomimetics at Thr18 result in a decrease in the binding affinity by ten- to twenty-fold when compared to the wild-type. Phosphorylation and phosphomimetics at Ser20 result in a smaller decrease in the affinity. Mutation of Lys24 and Leu25 also disrupts the interaction. Our results may be useful for further development of peptide-based drugs targeting the MDM2/p53 interaction. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum dots (QDs) are fundamentally interesting because of the stronger quantum size effect with decreased lateral dimensions relative to their larger 2D nanosheet counterparts. However, the preparation of a wide range of TMD QDs is still a continual challenge. Here we demonstrate a bottom-up strategy utilizing TM oxides or chlorides and chalcogen precursors to synthesize a small library of TMD QDs (MoS 2 , WS 2 , RuS 2 , MoTe 2 , MoSe 2 , WSe 2 and RuSe 2 ). The reaction reaches equilibrium almost instantaneously (~10–20 s) with mild aqueous and room temperature conditions. Tunable defect engineering can be achieved within the same reactions by deviating the precursors’ reaction stoichiometries from their fixed molecular stoichiometries. Using MoS 2 QDs for proof-of-concept biomedical applications, we show that increasing sulfur defects enhanced oxidative stress generation, through the photodynamic effect, in cancer cells. This facile strategy will motivate future design of TMDs nanomaterials utilizing defect engineering for biomedical applications. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Angiogenic sprouting can contribute adaptively, or mal-adaptively, to a myriad of conditions including ischemic heart disease and cancer. While the cellular and molecular systems that regulate tip versus stalk endothelial cell (EC) specification during angiogenesis are known, those systems that regulate their distinct actions remain poorly understood. Pre-clinical and clinical findings support sustained adrenergic signaling in promoting angiogenesis, but links between adrenergic signaling and angiogenesis are lacking; importantly, adrenergic agents alter the activation status of the cAMP signaling system. Here, we show that the cAMP effector, PKA, acts in a cell autonomous fashion to constitutively reduce the in vitro and ex vivo angiogenic sprouting capacity of ECs. At a cellular level, we observed that silencing or inhibiting PKA in human ECs increased their invasive capacity, their generation of podosome rosettes and, consequently, their ability to degrade a collagen matrix. While inhibition of either Src-family kinases or of cdc42 reduced these events in control ECs, only cdc42 inhibition, or silencing, significantly impacted them in PKA(Cα)-silenced ECs. Consistent with these findings, cell-based measurements of cdc42 activity revealed that PKA activation inhibits EC cdc42 activity, at least in part, by promoting its interaction with the inhibitory regulator, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-α (RhoGDIα). © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), also known as squalene monooxygenase, catalyzes the stereospecific conversion of squalene to 2,3(S)-oxidosqualene, a key step in cholesterol biosynthesis. SQLE inhibition is targeted for the treatment of hypercholesteremia, cancer, and fungal infections. However, lack of structure-function understanding has hindered further progression of its inhibitors. We have determined the first three-dimensional high-resolution crystal structures of human SQLE catalytic domain with small molecule inhibitors (2.3 Å and 2.5 Å). Comparison with its unliganded state (3.0 Å) reveals conformational rearrangements upon inhibitor binding, thus allowing deeper interpretation of known structure-activity relationships. We use the human SQLE structure to further understand the specificity of terbinafine, an approved agent targeting fungal SQLE, and to provide the structural insights into terbinafine-resistant mutants encountered in the clinic. Collectively, these findings elucidate the structural basis for the specificity of the epoxidation reaction catalyzed by SQLE and enable further rational development of next-generation inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Capecitabine (CAP) is an FDA-approved and frequently used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of various cancers. However, there are some side effects and chemoresistance limiting its use. Nanotechnological approaches can enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs. In this study, CAP-loaded nanoniosomes were prepared. Nanoniosomes were prepared by the method of thin film hydration wherein CAP was loaded into the nanoniosomes. Nanoniosomes were then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and (particle) vesicle size analysis. The cytotoxicity effect of the nanoniosomes were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. CAP was loaded into the nanoniosomes and loading capacity and entrapment efficiency were determined. The vesicle size of the nanoniosomes was obtained in the nanometer scale, and CAP release profiles from the nanoniosomes were also obtained. Finally, the cytotoxicity effect of CAP and CAP-loaded nanoniosomes were evaluated toward MCF7 and PANC1 cell lines. The nanoniosomes with an amphipathic structure can penetrate into the cells with an enhanced release rate. These caused the toxicity of drug in the nanoniosomes to be higher than the free drug.",

    "Abstract": "Hematopoietic chimerism after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may establish a state of donor antigen-specific tolerance. However, current allotransplantation protocols involve genotoxic conditioning which has harmful side-effects and predisposes to infection and cancer. Here we describe a non-genotoxic conditioning protocol for fully MHC-mismatched bone marrow allotransplantation in mice involving transient immunosuppression and selective depletion of recipient hematopoietic stem cells with a CD117-antibody-drug-conjugate (ADC). This protocol resulted in multilineage, high level (up to 50%), durable, donor-derived hematopoietic chimerism after transplantation of 20 million total bone marrow cells, compared with ≤ 2.1% hematopoietic chimerism from 50 million total bone marrow cells without conditioning. Moreover, long-term survival of bone marrow donor-type but not third party skin allografts is achieved in CD117-ADC-conditioned chimeric mice without chronic immunosuppression. The only observed adverse event is transient elevation of liver enzymes in the first week after conditioning. These results provide proof-of-principle for CD117-ADC as a non−genotoxic, highly-targeted conditioning agent in allotransplantation and tolerance protocols. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "First-order radiomic features, such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), are associated with disease progression in early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We hypothesized that a model incorporating first- and second-order radiomic features would more accurately predict outcome than MTV or TLG alone. We assessed whether radiomic features extracted from baseline PET scans predicted relapsed or refractory disease status in a cohort of 251 patients with stage I-II HL who were managed at a tertiary cancer center. Models were developed and tested using a machine-learning algorithm. Features extracted from mediastinal sites were highly predictive of primary refractory disease. A model incorporating 5 of the most predictive features had an area under the curve (AUC) of 95.2% and total error rate of 1.8%. By comparison, the AUC was 78% for both MTV and TLG and was 65% for maximum standardize uptake value (SUV max ). Furthermore, among the patients with refractory mediastinal disease, our model distinguished those who were successfully salvaged from those who ultimately died of HL. We conclude that our PET radiomic model may improve upfront stratification of early-stage HL patients with mediastinal disease and thus contribute to risk-adapted, individualized management. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Inactivating mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1), a key SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling gene, underlie small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT). To reveal its druggable vulnerabilities, we perform kinase-focused RNAi screens and uncover that SMARCA4-deficient SCCOHT cells are highly sensitive to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6). SMARCA4 loss causes profound downregulation of cyclin D1, which limits CDK4/6 kinase activity in SCCOHT cells and leads to in vitro and in vivo susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibitors. SCCOHT patient tumors are deficient in cyclin D1 yet retain the retinoblastoma-proficient/p16 INK4a -deficient profile associated with positive responses to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Thus, our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors, approved for a breast cancer subtype addicted to CDK4/6 activation, could be repurposed to treat SCCOHT. Moreover, our study suggests a novel paradigm whereby critically low oncogene levels, caused by loss of a driver tumor suppressor, may also be exploited therapeutically. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive tumor of the central nervous system that has poor prognosis despite extensive therapy. Therefore, it is essential to identify a gene expression-based signature for predicting GBM prognosis. The RNA sequencing data of GBM patients from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were employed in our study. The univariate and multivariate regression models were utilized to assess the relative contribution of each gene to survival prediction in both cohorts, and the common genes in two cohorts were identified as a final prognostic model. A prognostic risk score was calculated based on the prognostic gene signature. This prognostic signature stratified the patients into the low- and high-risk groups. Multivariate regression and stratification analyses were implemented to determine whether the gene signature was an independent prognostic factor. We identified a 6-gene signature through univariate and multivariate regression models. This prognostic signature stratified the patients into the low- and high-risk groups, implying improved and poor outcomes respectively. Multivariate regression and stratification analyses demonstrated that the predictive value of the 6-gene signature was independent of other clinical factors. This study highlights the significant implications of having a gene signature as a prognostic predictor in GBM, and its potential application in personalized therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The global prevalence of diabetes is high and rapidly increasing. Some previous studies have found that vegetarians might have a lower risk of diabetes than non-vegetarians. Objective: We examined the association between vegetarianism and risk of hospitalisation or death with diabetes in a large, prospective cohort study of British adults. Methods: The analysed cohort included participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford study who were diabetes free at recruitment (1993–2001), with available dietary intake data at baseline, and linked hospital admissions and death data for diabetes over follow-up (n = 45,314). Participants were categorised as regular meat eaters (≥50 g per day: n = 15,181); low meat eaters (<50 g of meat per day: n = 7615); fish eaters (ate no meat but consumed fish: n = 7092); and vegetarians (ate no meat or fish, including vegans: n = 15,426). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations between diet group and risk of diabetes. Results: Over a mean of 17.6 years of follow-up, 1224 incident cases of diabetes were recorded. Compared with regular meat eaters, the low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians were less likely to develop diabetes (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54–0.75; HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.38–0.59; and HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.54–0.74, respectively). These associations were substantially attenuated after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) (low meat eaters: HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66–0.92; fish eaters: HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.51–0.80; and vegetarians: HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.76–1.05). Conclusions: Low meat and non-meat eaters had a lower risk of diabetes, in part because of a lower BMI. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The gut microbiota has been linked to various neurological disorders via the gut–brain axis. Diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet established for treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy in children. Its efficacy in reducing seizures has been confirmed, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The diet has also shown positive effects in a wide range of other diseases, including Alzheimer’s, depression, autism, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. We collected fecal samples from 12 children with therapy-resistant epilepsy before starting KD and after 3 months on the diet. Parents did not start KD and served as diet controls. Applying shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, both taxonomic and functional profiles were established. Here we report that alpha diversity is not changed significantly during the diet, but differences in both taxonomic and functional composition are detected. Relative abundance of bifidobacteria as well as E. rectale and Dialister is significantly diminished during the intervention. An increase in relative abundance of E. coli is observed on KD. Functional analysis revealed changes in 29 SEED subsystems including the reduction of seven pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decomposition of these shifts indicates that bifidobacteria and Escherichia are important contributors to the observed functional shifts. As relative abundance of health-promoting, fiber-consuming bacteria becomes less abundant during KD, we raise concern about the effects of the diet on the gut microbiota and overall health. Further studies need to investigate whether these changes are necessary for the therapeutic effect of KD. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Hemophilia A (HA) is an inherited and rare X-linked bleeding disorder which is caused by mutations of the factor VIII gene (FVIII). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding sequence transcripts containing more than 200 nucleotides and have potential in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cancers and inherited bleeding disorders like thalassemia. The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between the expression of lncRNAs and the incidence of hemophilia A in Iranian population. METHODS: In this study, after bioinformatics analysis and lncRNA identification, the expression of two lncRNAs including NONHSAT139215 and NONHSAT139219 was investigated among the blood samples of severe hemophilia A and healthy (non-hemophilia) subjects using the relative qRT-PCR technique. RESULTS: The melting curve analysis confirmed the specificity of primers. Also, the standard curve showed that the efficiency of reactions for β2-microglobulin (B2M), NONHSAT139215 and NONHSAT139219 was 1.91, 1.96 and 2.01, respectively. On the other hand, the statistical analysis using REST software indicated that the expression of NONHSAT139219 and NONHSAT139215 in severe HA patients was significantly down-regulated as compared to control group (p < .05). DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrated that a decrease in the expression of two lncRNAs located in FVIII gene may play an important role for the development of severe hemophilia A for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Briefly, the abnormal expression levels of lncRNAs in hemophilia A cases may be correlated with disease intensity. However, further studies of these lncRNAs are required to provide a useful insight into hemophilia biology.",

    "Abstract": "Latin Americans and Chilean Amerindians have the highest prevalence of gallstone disease (GSD) and gallbladder cancer (GBC) in the world. A handful of loci have been associated with GSD in populations of predominantly European ancestry, however, they only explain a small portion of the genetic component of the disease. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for GSD in 1,095 admixed Chilean Latinos with Mapuche Native American ancestry. Disease status was assessed by cholecystectomy or abdominal ultrasonography. Top-10 candidate variants surpassing the suggestive cutoff of P &lt; 1 × 10 −5 in the discovery cohort were genotyped in an independent replication sample composed of 1,643 individuals. Variants with positive replication were further examined in two European GSD populations and a Chilean GBC cohort. We consistently replicated the association of ABCG8 gene with GSD (rs11887534, P = 3.24 × 10 −8 , OR = 1.74) and identified TRAF3 (rs12882491, P = 1.11 × 10 −7 , OR = 1.40) as a novel candidate gene for the disease in admixed Chilean Latinos. ABCG8 and TRAF3 variants also conferred risk to GBC. Gene expression analyses indicated that TRAF3 was significantly decreased in gallbladder (P = 0.015) and duodenal mucosa (P = 0.001) of GSD individuals compared to healthy controls, where according to GTEx data in the small intestine, the presence of the risk allele contributes to the observed effect. We conclude that ABCG8 and TRAF3 genes are associated with GSD and GBC in admixed Latinos and that decreased TRAF3 levels could enhance gallbladder inflammation as is observed in GSD and GSD-associated GBC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ustilaginoidins are a kind of mycotoxins with 9,9′-linked bis-naphtho-γ-pyrones structures produced by the rice false smut pathogen Villosiclava virens. These metabolites displayed a wide range of bioactivities, such as teratogenic, cytotoxic, phytotoxic, and antibacterial activities. So far 26 ustilaginoidins have been isolated from V. virens, among which 18 compounds contained stereogenic center(s), however, most of them were unknown for the absolute configurations, except that of ustilaginoidin D. In this study, the absolute structures of these ustilaginoidins were constructed for the first time by analysis of the biosynthetic monomers obtained from a gene knockout mutant (ΔUV_2091) of V. virens. The gene UV_2091 was predicted to encode an enzyme that dimerized the monomeric naphtho-γ-pyrones in V. virens. Knockout of this gene led to the accumulation of three monomers, namely hemiustilaginoidin F (1), epihemiustilaginoidin D (2), and hemiustilaginoidin D (3), but the production of ustilaginoidins was completely blocked. The structures of the monomers were deduced by spectroscopic analysis, in combination with TDDFT ECD calculations for determining the absolute configurations. These compounds were tested for their phytotoxic, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. Compounds 1 and 3 showed inhibition against the radicle and plumule elongation of rice and lettuce seeds at the tested concentrations. Compound 1 was active against the tested five human cancer cells, with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of 13.2~37.3 μM. Compounds 1~3 inhibited the growth of the tested pathogenic bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 8~32 µg/mL, while compound 3 exhibited antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae (IC 50 , 5.21 µg/mL). A comparison of these data with those of the ustilaginoidins provided insights into the structure-bioactivity relationships. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Few studies implicate immunoregulatory gene expression in tumor cells in arbitrating brain tumor progression. Here we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) is highly expressed in glioma stem cells and primary glioblastoma (GBM) cells. FGL2 knockout in tumor cells did not affect tumor-cell proliferation in vitro or tumor progression in immunodeficient mice but completely impaired GBM progression in immune-competent mice. This impairment was reversed in mice with a defect in dendritic cells (DCs) or CD103 + DC differentiation in the brain and in tumor-draining lymph nodes. The presence of FGL2 in tumor cells inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-induced CD103 + DC differentiation by suppressing NF-κB, STAT1/5, and p38 activation. These findings are relevant to GBM patients because a low level of FGL2 expression with concurrent high GM-CSF expression is associated with higher CD8B expression and longer survival. These data provide a rationale for therapeutic inhibition of FGL2 in brain tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Oliveria decumbens is an aromatic plant traditionally used for treatment of infections and gastrointestinal diseases. In the present study, the volatile oil of the plant was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. In addition, antibacterial and anti-Helicobacter pylori activities of this essential oil were determined using disc diffusion and agar dilution methods, respectively. Insecticidal activity was assessed through topical and fumigation application of the essential oil to cabbage looper larvae. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition by the essential oil was examined using Ellman’s method. Furthermore, its cytotoxic potential against three different cancer cell lines was assessed using the MTT assay. The phenolic monoterpenoids, thymol (38.79%), and carvacrol (36.30%) were identified as major constituents of the essential oil. We observed significant antibacterial activity of the essential oil against H. pylori (MIC=20.4 µg /mL) as well as other tested bacteria, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. O. decumbens essential oil showed significant toxicity to cabbage looper larvae with LD 50 value of 52.1 µg /larva following topical and fumigant administration. O. decumbens essential oil was considerably inhibitory to acetylcholinesterase activity (IC50 = 0.117 µg/mL). Cytotoxic assay of the volatile oil resulted in IC50 = 0.065, 0.104, and 0.141 μg/mL for MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively. According to our data, this species with high concentrations of thymol and carvacrol could be considered as a natural source for pharmaceutical products. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "The Hippo pathway plays an important role in organ development and adult tissue homeostasis, and its deregulation has been implicated in many cancers. The Hippo signaling relies on a core kinase cascade culminating in phosphorylation of the transcription coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Although Yki is the key effector of Hippo pathway, the regulation of its protein stability is still unclear. Here, we show that Hippo pathway attenuates the binding of a ubiquitin-specific protease Usp7 to Yki, which regulates Hippo signaling through deubiquitinating Yki. Furthermore, the mammalian homolog of Usp7, HAUSP plays a conserved role in regulating Hippo pathway by modulating Yap ubiquitination and degradation. Finally, we find that the expression of HAUSP is positively correlated with that of Yap, both showing upregulated levels in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. In summary, our findings demonstrate that Yki/Yap is stabilized by Usp7/HAUSP, and provide HAUSP as a potential therapeutic target for HCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nuclear nanomedicine, with its targeting ability and heavily loading capacity, along with its enhanced retention to avoid rapid clearance as faced with molecular radiopharmaceuticals, provides unique opportunities to treat tumors and metastasis. Despite these promises, this field has seen limited activities, primarily because of a lack of suitable nanocarriers, which are safe, excretable and have favorable pharmacokinetics to efficiently deliver and retain radionuclides in a tumor. Here, we introduce biodegradable laser-synthesized Si nanoparticles having round shape, controllable low-dispersion size, and being free of any toxic impurities, as highly suitable carriers of therapeutic 188 Re radionuclide. The conjugation of the polyethylene glycol-coated Si nanoparticles with radioactive 188 Re takes merely 1 hour, compared to its half-life of 17 hours. When intravenously administered in a Wistar rat model, the conjugates demonstrate free circulation in the blood stream to reach all organs and target tumors, which is radically in contrast with that of the 188 Re salt that mostly accumulates in the thyroid gland. We also show that the nanoparticles ensure excellent retention of 188 Re in tumor, not possible with the salt, which enables one to maximize the therapeutic effect, as well as exhibit a complete time-delayed conjugate bioelimination. Finally, our tests on rat survival demonstrate excellent therapeutic effect (72% survival compared to 0% of the control group). Combined with a series of imaging and therapeutic functionalities based on unique intrinsic properties of Si nanoparticles, the proposed biodegradable complex promises a major advancement in nuclear nanomedicine. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Myofibroblasts are the key effector cells responsible for excessive extracellular matrix deposition in multiple fibrotic conditions, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis has been implicated in fibrosis, with pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibition currently under clinical evaluation in IPF. Here we demonstrate that rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 signaling via 4E-BP1 is a critical pathway for TGF-β 1 stimulated collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblasts, whereas canonical PI3K/Akt signaling is not required. The importance of mTORC1 signaling was confirmed by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in normal and IPF fibroblasts, as well as in lung cancer-associated fibroblasts, dermal fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells. The inhibitory effect of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibition extended to other matrisome proteins implicated in the development of fibrosis and human disease relevance was demonstrated in live precision-cut IPF lung slices. Our data demonstrate that the mTORC1/4E-BP1 axis represents a critical signaling node during fibrogenesis with potential implications for the development of novel anti-fibrotic strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Because of its association with severe gastric pathologies, including gastric cancer, Helicobacter pylori has been subject of research for more than 30 years. Its capacity to adapt and survive in the human stomach can be attributed to its genetic flexibility. Its natural competence and its capacity to turn genes on and off allows H. pylori to adapt rapidly to the changing conditions of its host. Because of its genetic variability, it is difficult to establish the uniqueness of each strain obtained from a human host. The methods considered to-date to deliver the best result for differentiation of strains are Rapid Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis. While RAPD analysis is cost-effective, it requires a stable genome for its reliability. MLST and WGS are optimal for strain identification, however, they require analysis of data at the bioinformatics level. Using the StainFree method, which modifies tryptophan residues on proteins using 2, 2, 2, - trichloroethanol (TCE), we observed a strain specific pattern of tryptophan in 1D acrylamide gels. In order to establish the effectiveness of tryptophan fingerprinting for strain identification, we compared the graphic analysis of tryptophan-labelled bands in the gel images with MLST results. Based on this, we find that tryptophan banding patterns can be used as an alternative method for the differentiation of H. pylori strains. Furthermore, investigating the origin for these differences, we found that H. pylori strains alters the number and/or position of tryptophan present in several proteins at the genetic code level, with most exchanges taking place in membrane- and cation-binding proteins, which could be part of a novel response of H. pylori to host adaptation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the physiological functions of Myo10 (myosin X) using Myo10 reporter knockout (Myo10 tm2 ) mice. Full-length (motorized) Myo10 protein was deleted, but the brain-specific headless (Hdl) isoform (Hdl-Myo10) was still expressed in homozygous mutants. In vitro, we confirmed that Hdl-Myo10 does not induce filopodia, but it strongly localized to the plasma membrane independent of the MyTH4-FERM domain. Filopodia-inducing Myo10 is implicated in axon guidance and mice lacking the Myo10 cargo protein DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) have severe commissural defects, whereas MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of isolated brains revealed intact commissures in Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice. However, reminiscent of Waardenburg syndrome, a neural crest disorder, Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice exhibited pigmentation defects (white belly spots) and simple syndactyly with high penetrance (&gt;95%), and 24% of mutant embryos developed exencephalus, a neural tube closure defect. Furthermore, Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice consistently displayed bilateral persistence of the hyaloid vasculature, revealed by MRI and retinal whole-mount preparations. In principle, impaired tissue clearance could contribute to persistence of hyaloid vasculature and syndactyly. However, Myo10-deficient macrophages exhibited no defects in the phagocytosis of apoptotic or IgG-opsonized cells. RNA sequence analysis showed that Myo10 was the most strongly expressed unconventional myosin in retinal vascular endothelial cells and expression levels increased 4-fold between P6 and P15, when vertical sprouting angiogenesis gives rise to deeper layers. Nevertheless, imaging of isolated adult mutant retinas did not reveal vascularization defects. In summary, Myo10 is important for both prenatal (neural tube closure and digit formation) and postnatal development (hyaloid regression, but not retinal vascularization). © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Systems biology perspectives are crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of complex diseases, and therefore hold great promise for the discovery of novel treatment strategies. Drug combinations have been shown to improve durability and reduce resistance to available first-line therapies in a variety of cancers; however, traditional drug discovery approaches are prohibitively cost and labor-intensive to evaluate large-scale matrices of potential drug combinations. Computational methods are needed to efficiently model complex interactions of drug target pathways and identify mechanisms underlying drug combination synergy. In this study, we employ a computational approach, SynGeNet (Synergy from Gene expression and Network mining), which integrates transcriptomics-based connectivity mapping and network centrality analysis to analyze disease networks and predict drug combinations. As an exemplar of a disease in which combination therapies demonstrate efficacy in genomic-specific contexts, we investigate malignant melanoma. We employed SynGeNet to generate drug combination predictions for each of the four major genomic subtypes of melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, NF1, and triple wild type) using publicly available gene expression and mutation data. We validated synergistic drug combinations predicted by our method across all genomic subtypes using results from a high-throughput drug screening study across. Finally, we prospectively validated the drug combination for BRAF-mutant melanoma that was top ranked by our approach, vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) + tretinoin (retinoic acid receptor agonist), using both in vitro and in vivo models of BRAF-mutant melanoma and RNA-sequencing analysis of drug-treated melanoma cells to validate the predicted mechanisms. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of disease domains, and, importantly, can model disease-relevant protein subnetworks in precision medicine contexts. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Raf kinases are downstream effectors of small GTPase Ras. Mutations in Ras and Raf are associated with a variety of cancers and genetic disorders. Of the three Raf isoforms, cRaf is most frequently involved in tumor initiation by Ras. Cytosolic Raf is auto-inhibited and becomes active upon recruitment to the plasma membrane. Since the catalytic domain of Raf is its kinase domain, we ask the following: does the kinase domain of Raf has potential to interact with membrane and if yes, what role does the membrane interaction play? We present a model of cRaf kinase domain in complex with a heterogeneous membrane bilayer using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. We show that the kinase domain of cRaf has three distinct membrane-interacting regions: a polybasic motif (R.RKTR) from the regulatory αC-helix, an aromatic/hydrophobic cluster from the N-terminal acidic region (NtA) and positively charged/aromatic cluster from the activation segment (AS). We show that residues from these regions form an extended membrane-interacting surface that resembles the membrane-interacting residues from known membrane-binding domains. Activating phosphorylatable regions (NtA and AS), make direct contact with the membrane whereas R.RKTR forms specific multivalent salt bridges with PA. PA lipids dwell for longer times around the R.RKTR motif. Our results suggest that membrane interaction of monomeric cRaf kinase domain likely orchestrates the Raf activation process and modulates its function. We show that R.RKTR is a hotspot that interacts with membrane when cRaf is monomeric and becomes part of the interface upon Raf dimerization. We propose that in terms of utilizing a specific hotspot to form membrane interaction and dimer formation, both Raf and its upstream binding partner KRas, are similar. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This work investigated the preparation of specific targeted drug delivery systems in cancer chemotherapy by folate conjugated human serum albumin nanoparticles encapsulated resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles (FA-HSA-RESNPs). FA was coupled to HSA, and RES was encapsulated in FA-conjugated HSA by high pressure fluid nano-homogeneous emulsification. The average particle size and polydispersity index of NPs prepared under optimal conditions were 102.1 ± 4.9 nm and 0.001. The drug capsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency were 98.36 and 14.66%, respectively. The analysis of the results of the physical characterization showed that the RES was present in the FA-HSA-RESNPs in an amorphous state. In vitro drug-release study showed that the NPs can release the drug persistently and slowly. The inhibition rate of FA-HSA-RESNPs and RES was detected using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide method to be 110.8 and 157.2 μM, respectively. The targeting ability of the FA-HSA-RESNPs for the HepG2 cell was measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate-modified albumin techniques. The uptake rate of FA-HSA-RESNPs was higher than that of the original RES. By using near-infrared imaging, in vivo activity was labeled with Cy5 fluorescent FA-HSA-RESNP confirmed FA-HSA-RESNP tumor-targeting ability. The intravenous administration bioavailability of FA-HSA-RESNPs was about 5.95-fold higher than that of the original RES.",

    "Abstract": "Prostate diseases include prostate cancer, which is the second most common male neoplasia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which affects approximately 50% of men. The incidence of prostate disease is increasing, and some of this increase may be attributable to ancestral exposure to environmental toxicants and epigenetic transgenerational inheritance mechanisms. The goal of the current study was to determine the effects that exposure of gestating female rats to vinclozolin has on the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate disease, and to characterize by what molecular epigenetic mechanisms this has occurred. Gestating female rats (F0 generation) were exposed to vinclozolin during E8-E14 of gestation. F1 generation offspring were bred to produce the F2 generation, which were bred to produce the transgenerational F3 generation. The transgenerational F3 generation vinclozolin lineage males at 12 months of age had an increased incidence of prostate histopathology and abnormalities compared to the control lineage. Ventral prostate epithelial and stromal cells were isolated from F3 generation 20-day old rats, prior to the onset of pathology, and used to obtain DNA and RNA for analysis. Results indicate that there were transgenerational changes in gene expression, noncoding RNA expression, and DNA methylation in both cell types. Our results suggest that ancestral exposure to vinclozolin at a critical period of gestation induces the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate stromal and epithelial cell changes in both the epigenome and transcriptome that ultimately lead to prostate disease susceptibility and may serve as a source of the increased incidence of prostate pathology observed in recent years. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glycine-N-methyl transferase (GNMT) a tumor suppressor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) plays a crucial role in liver homeostasis. Its expression is downregulated in almost all the tumor tissues of HCC while the mechanism of this downregulation is not yet fully understood. Recently, we identified 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (PGG) as a GNMT promoter enhancer compound in HCC. In this study, we aimed to delineate the mechanism by which PGG enhances GNMT expression and to investigate its effect on GNMT suppression in HCC. Microarray and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that MYC was a major target of PGG. PGG suppressed MYC mRNA and protein expression in Huh7 and Hep G2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, MYC expression was also reduced in xenograft tumors in PGG treated mice. Moreover, shRNA-mediated knocked-down or pharmacological inhibition of MYC resulted in a significant induction of GNMT promoter activity and endogenous GNMT mRNA expression in Huh7 cells. In contrast, overexpression of MYC significantly inhibited GNMT promoter activity and endogenous GNMT protein expression. In addition, antibodies against MYC effectively precipitated the human GNMT promoter in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Lastly, GNMT expression was negatively correlated with MYC expression in human HCC samples. Interestingly, PGG not only inhibited MYC gene expression but also promoted MYC protein degradation through proteasome-independent pathways. This work reveals a novel anticancer mechanism of PGG via downregulation of MYC expression and establishes a therapeutic rationale for treatment of MYC overexpressing cancers using PGG. Our data also provide a novel mechanistic understanding of GNMT regulation through MYC in the pathogenesis of HCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interstitial low dose rate brachyther-apy is established organ spar-ing treatment of T1-&#8202;T2 penile carcinoma. Experience with high-dose rate brachyther-apy is limited in this indication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with early penile carcinoma were treated by high-dose rate brachyther-apy at dose 18 × 3 Gy per fraction twice daily between 2002-&#8202;2018 at the Department of Oncology and Radiother-apy, University Hospital in Hradec Kralove. Breast interstitial brachyther-apy template was used for fixation and precise geometry reconstruction of stainless hollow needles. RESULTS: Median follow up was 85 months (range 7-&#8202;200 months). Acute reaction usually consisted of grade 2 mucositis that dissolved dur-ing 8 weeks after the treatment. Local recurrence occurred in 6 patients, 5 of them were successfully treated with partial amputation. One patient had a nodal recurrence successfully salvaged by lymphadenectomy. One patient developed necrosis of the glans requir-ing partial amputation. Currently, there are 24 patients alive without signs of dis-ease. One patient died of cardiac comorbidity, one died of duplicate lung cancer. Nineteen patients have a preserved penis (73%), 18 of them sexually active before treatment report satisfactory intercourse. CONCLUSION: Hyperfractionated interstitial high-dose rate brachyther-apy with 18 × 3 Gy per fraction twice daily is a promis-ing method in selected patients with penile carcinoma and deserves further evaluation in a larger prospective study.

    "Abstract": "The further optimization of ER-α degradation efficacy of a series of ER modulators by refining side-chain substitution led to efficacious selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). A fluoromethyl azetidine group was found to be preferred and resulted in the identification of bis-phenol chromene 17ha. In a tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer xenograft model, 17ha (ER-α degradation efficacy = 97%) demonstrated tumor regression, together with robust reduction of intratumoral ER-α levels. However, despite superior oral exposure, 5a (ER-α degradation efficacy = 91%) had inferior activity. This result suggests that optimizing ER-α degradation efficacy leads to compounds with robust effects in a model of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. Compound 17ha (GDC-0927) was evaluated in clinical trials in women with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cats spontaneously develop invasive mammary carcinomas with high clinical aggressiveness, and are considered relevant animal models for human breast cancer. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic pro-survival protein, whose expression is associated with a favorable outcome in human breast cancer. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of Bcl-2 expression in feline invasive mammary carcinomas (FMCs), its relationship with other clinicopathologic variables, and its prognostic value. This retrospective study included 180 FMCs, diagnosed in female cats treated by surgery only, with a 2-year follow-up post-mastectomy. Bcl-2, ER, PR, Ki-67, HER2, and CK5/6 expression were determined by automated immunohistochemistry. A receiver-operating-characteristic curve was used to set the threshold for Bcl-2 positivity. Results: The cohort comprises 32% (57/180) luminal FMCs defined by ER and/or PR positivity, and 68% (123/180) triple-negative FMCs (negative for ER, PR, and HER2). Bcl-2 expression was considered as positive when at least 65% of tumor cells were immunohistochemically stained. Thirty-one out of 180 FMCs (17%) were Bcl-2-positive. There was no significant association between Bcl-2 expression, and the tumor size, nodal stage, histological grade, or ER, PR, Ki-67, HER2, and CK5/6 expression. By multivariate survival analysis (Cox proportional-hazards regression), Bcl-2 positivity in FMCs was associated with longer disease-free interval (p = 0.005, HR = 0.38), overall survival (p = 0.028, HR = 0.61), and cancer-specific survival (p = 0.019, HR = 0.54) independently of other powerful prognostic factors such as pathologic tumor size, pathologic nodal stage, and distant metastasis. The positive prognostic value of Bcl-2 was confirmed in both luminal FMCs, of which 9/57 (16%) were Bcl-2-positive, and in basal-like triple-negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-, CK5/6+) FMCs, of which 14/76 (18%) were Bcl-2-positive. Conclusions: Compared to human breast cancer, Bcl-2 positivity in feline invasive mammary carcinomas is also associated with better outcome, but is less common, and not associated with ER, PR, and HER2 expression. Cats with spontaneous Bcl-2-positive FMCs could be useful in preclinical trials evaluating anti-Bcl-2 strategies for chemoresistant luminal or triple-negative breast cancers. © 2019 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Kidney-type glutaminase (GLS), the first enzyme in the glutaminolysis pathway, catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. GLS was found to be upregulated in many glutamine-dependent cancer cells. Therefore, selective inhibition of GLS has gained substantial interest as a therapeutic approach targeting cancer metabolism. Bis-2-[5-(phenylacetamido)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]ethyl sulfide (BPTES), despite its poor physicochemical properties, has served as a key molecular template in subsequent efforts to identify more potent and drug-like allosteric GLS inhibitors. This review article provides an overview of the progress made to date in the development of GLS inhibitors and highlights the remarkable transformation of the unfavorable lead into \"druglike\" compounds guided by systematic SAR studies. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "A novel class of bivalent ligands targeting putative protease-activated receptor (PAR) heteromers has been prepared based upon reported antagonists for the subtypes PAR1 and PAR2. Modified versions of the PAR1 antagonist RWJ-58259 containing alkyne adapters were connected via cycloaddition reactions to azide-capped polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacers attached to imidazopyridazine-based PAR2 antagonists. Initial studies of the PAR1-PAR2 antagonists indicated that they inhibited G alpha q-mediated calcium mobilization in endothelial and cancer cells driven by both PAR1 and PAR2 agonists. Compounds of this novel class hold promise for the prevention of restenosis, cancer cell metastasis, and other proliferative disorders. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",
