    "Abstract": "The aims of this study are to investigate the selective cytotoxic activity of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 )-extracted freeze-dried leaf juice (FDLJ) of Carica papaya on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC25) cells, and to delineate the best small scale extraction parameters allowing maximal extract activity. Using scCO 2 as a solvent, six operating parameters were studied and the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) process investigated using a factorial design 2 6-2 . The processing values promoting cytotoxic activity towards SCC-25 are: high pressure (250 bar), low temperature (35 °C), extended processing time (180 minutes), as well as a large amount of starting material (5 g). The factorial experimental design successfully identified the key parameters controlling the SFE of molecules cytotoxic to SCC cells from C. papaya juice. This study also validated the extraction method and showed that the SFE yield was reproducible. The chromatographic and mass spectrometric profiles of the scCO 2 extract acquired with high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) were used to tentatively identify the bioactive compounds using comparative analysis. The principal compounds were likely to be mainly vitamins and phytosterols, some of which are documented to be cytotoxic to cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) contributes to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and inter-strand crosslinks. The HR activity in cancer cells can be used to predict their sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents that cause these damages. To evaluate HR activity, we developed a system called Assay for Site-specific HR Activity (ASHRA), in which cells are transiently transfected with an expression vector for CRISPR/Cas9 and a HR donor sequence containing a marker gene. DSBs are created by Cas9 and then repaired by HR using donor vector sequences homologous to the target gene. The level of genomic integration of the marker gene is quantified by Western blotting, flowcytometry, or quantitative PCR (qPCR). ASHRA detected HR deficiency caused by BRCA1, BARD1, or RAD51 knockdown or introduction of BRCA1 variants. The influence of BRCA1 variants on HR, as determined by qPCR, was consistent with the chemosensitivities of the transfected cells. The qPCR format of ASHRA could measure HR activity in both transcribed and un-transcribed regions. Knockdown of BRCA1 nor BARD1 did not affect HR activity in a transcriptionally inactive site. ASHRA can evaluate HR activity and will be useful for predicting sensitivity to chemotherapy, screening drugs that affect HR, and investigating the mechanisms of HR. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) catalyzing the formation of asymmetric dimethylarginines has been implicated in cancer development, metastasis, and prognosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of low PRMT1 levels on a non-MYCN amplified neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. Stable PRMT1-knockdown (PRMT1-KD) cells showed reduced growth rates and cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M. They also exhibited senescent phenotypes and increased p53 expression. p21 and PAI-1, which are two p53 downstream targets critical for senescence, were significantly induced in SK-N-SH cells subjected to either PRMT1-KD or inhibitor treatment. The induction was suppressed by a p53 inhibitor and marginal in a p53-null SK-N-AS cell line, suggesting dependence on p53. In general, the DNA damage and ROS levels of the PRMT1-KD SK-N-SH cells were slightly increased. Their migration activity also increased with the induction of PAI-1. Thus, PRMT1 downregulation released the repression of cellular senescence and migration activity in SK-N-SH cells. These results might partially explain the poor prognostic outcome of low PRMT1 in a non-MYCN-amplified cohort and indicate the multifaceted complexity of PRMT1 as a biological regulator of neuroblastoma. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The first step in the development of human colorectal cancer is aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt signaling hyperactivation is predominantly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that encodes the pathway negative regulator. In order to identify genes affected by the Apc loss, we performed expression profiling of intestinal epithelium isolated from mice harboring a conditional Apc allele. The gene encoding transcriptional factor msh homeobox 1 (Msx1) displayed robust upregulation upon Apc inactivation. Histological analysis of the Apc-deficient epithelium revealed that in the small intestine, the Msx1 protein was localized exclusively in ectopic crypts, i.e., in pockets of proliferating cells abnormally positioned on the villi. Ablation of the Msx1 gene leads to the disappearance of ectopic crypts and loss of differentiated cells. Moreover, tumors arising from Msx1-deficient cells display altered morphology reminiscent of villous adenomas. In human tumor specimens, MSX1 displayed significantly increased expression in colonic neoplasia with a descending tendency during the lesion progression towards colorectal carcinoma. In summary, the results indicate that Msx1 represents a novel marker of intestinal tumorigenesis. In addition, we described the previously unknown relationship between the Msx1-dependent formation of ectopic crypts and cell differentiation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that regulates fibrinolysis, cell adhesion and cell motility via its interactions with plasminogen activators and vitronectin. PAI-1 has been shown to play a role in a number of diverse pathologies including cardiovascular diseases, obesity and cancer and is therefore an attractive therapeutic target. However the multiple patho-physiological roles of PAI-1, and understanding the relative contributions of these in any one disease setting, make the development of therapeutically relevant molecules challenging. Here we describe the identification and characterisation of fully human antibody MEDI-579, which binds with high affinity and specificity to the active form of human PAI-1. MEDI-579 specifically inhibits serine protease interactions with PAI-1 while conserving vitronectin binding. Crystallographic analysis reveals that this specificity is achieved through direct binding of MEDI-579 Fab to the reactive centre loop (RCL) of PAI-1 and at the same exosite used by both tissue and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA). We propose that MEDI-579 acts by directly competing with proteases for RCL binding and as such is able to modulate the interaction of PAI-1 with tPA and uPA in a way not previously described for a human PAI-1 inhibitor. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Sex bias in innate defense against Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is dependent on both estrogen production by the host and S. aureus secretion of the virulence factor, α-hemolysin (Hla). The impact of estrogen signaling on the immune system is most often studied in terms of the nuclear estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. However, the potential contribution of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) to innate defense against infectious disease, particularly with respect to skin infection, has not been addressed. Using a murine model of SSTI, we found that GPER activation with the highly selective agonist G-1 limits S. aureus SSTI and Hla-mediated pathogenesis, effects that were absent in GPER knockout mice. Specifically, G-1 reduced Hla-mediated skin lesion formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, while increasing bacterial clearance. In vitro, G-1 reduced surface expression of the Hla receptor, ADAM10, in a human keratinocyte cell line and increased resistance to Hla-mediated permeability barrier disruption. This novel role for GPER activation in skin innate defense against infectious disease suggests that G-1 may have clinical utility in patients with epithelial permeability barrier dysfunction or who are otherwise at increased risk of S. aureus infection, including those with atopic dermatitis or cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unsatisfactory and, despite major advances in genomic studies, the biological mechanisms underlying chemoresistance are still poorly understood. We conducted for the first time a large-scale differential multi-omics investigation on DLBCL patient’s samples in order to identify new biomarkers that could early identify patients at risk of R/R disease and to identify new targets that could determine chemorefractoriness. We compared a well-characterized cohort of R/R versus chemosensitive DLBCL patients by combining label-free quantitative proteomics and targeted RNA sequencing performed on the same tissues samples. The cross-section of both data levels allowed extracting a sub-list of 22 transcripts/proteins pairs whose expression levels significantly differed between the two groups of patients. In particular, we identified significant targets related to tumor metabolism (Hexokinase 3), microenvironment (IDO1, CXCL13), cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion (S100 proteins) or BCR signaling pathway (CD79B). Overall, this study revealed several extremely promising biomarker candidates related to DLBCL chemorefractoriness and highlighted some new potential therapeutic drug targets. The complete datasets have been made publically available and should constitute a valuable resource for the future research. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "HPV genomic variability and chromosomal integration are important in the HPV-induced carcinogenic process. To uncover these genomic events in an HPV infection, we have developed an innovative and cost-effective sequencing approach named TaME-seq (tagmentation-assisted multiplex PCR enrichment sequencing). TaME-seq combines tagmentation and multiplex PCR enrichment for simultaneous analysis of HPV variation and chromosomal integration, and it can also be adapted to other viruses. For method validation, cell lines (n = 4), plasmids (n = 3), and HPV16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 positive clinical samples (n = 21) were analysed. Our results showed deep HPV genome-wide sequencing coverage. Chromosomal integration breakpoints and large deletions were identified in HPV positive cell lines and in one clinical sample. HPV genomic variability was observed in all samples allowing identification of low frequency variants. In contrast to other approaches, TaME-seq proved to be highly efficient in HPV target enrichment, leading to reduced sequencing costs. Comprehensive studies on HPV intra-host variability generated during a persistent infection will improve our understanding of viral carcinogenesis. Efficient identification of both HPV variability and integration sites will be important for the study of HPV evolution and adaptability and may be an important tool for use in cervical cancer diagnostics. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "p53 is frequently mutated in human cancers. Its levels are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. The complex between MDM2 and p53 is largely formed by the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain of p53 (residues 15–29). We investigated the kinetic and thermodynamic basis of the MDM2/p53 interaction by using wild-type and mutant variants of the TA domain. We focus on the effects of phosphorylation at positions Thr18 and Ser20 including their substitution with phosphomimetics. Conformational propensities of the isolated peptides were investigated using in silico methods and experimentally by circular dichroism and 1H-NMR in aqueous solution. Both experimental and computational analyses indicate that the p53 peptides are mainly disordered in aqueous solution, with evidence of nascent helix around the Ser20-Leu25 region. Both phosphorylation and the phosphomimetics at Thr18 result in a decrease in the binding affinity by ten- to twenty-fold when compared to the wild-type. Phosphorylation and phosphomimetics at Ser20 result in a smaller decrease in the affinity. Mutation of Lys24 and Leu25 also disrupts the interaction. Our results may be useful for further development of peptide-based drugs targeting the MDM2/p53 interaction. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is closely correlated with diverse cardiovascular diseases, augmenting the risk of heart failure and sudden death. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been studied in cardiac hypertrophy for their regulatory function. LncRNA MEG3 has been reported in human cancers. Whereas, it is unknown whether MEG3 regulates the growth of cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the specific role of MEG3 in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we found that MEG3 contributed to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. MEG3 expression was remarkably strengthened in the mice heart which undergone the transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that MEG3 was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes which were treated with Ang-II. Silenced MEG3 inhibited the increasing size of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and reversed other hypertrophic responses. Mechanically, MEG3 could affect cardiac hypertrophy by regulating gene expression. Mechanically, we found that MEG3 could be upregulated by the transcription factor STAT3 and could regulate miR-361-5p and HDAC9 by acting as a ceRNA. Finally, rescue assays were made to do further confirmation. All our findings revealed that STAT3-inducetd upregulation of lncRNA MEG3 controls cardiac hypertrophy by regulating miR-362-5p/HDAC9 axis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Biosynthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a key signalling molecule in human (patho)physiology, is mostly accomplished by the human enzymes cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). Several lines of evidence have shown a close correlation between increased H2S production and human diseases, such as several cancer types and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Identifying compounds selectively and potently inhibiting the human H2S-synthesizing enzymes may therefore prove beneficial for pharmacological applications. Here, the human enzymes CBS, CSE and MST were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and thirty-one pyridine derivatives were synthesized and screened for their ability to bind and inhibit these enzymes. Using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), circular dichroism spectropolarimetry (CD), and activity assays based on fluorimetric and colorimetric H2S detection, two compounds (C30 and C31) sharing structural similarities were found to weakly inhibit both CBS and CSE: 1 mM C30 inhibited these enzymes by approx. 50% and 40%, respectively, while 0.5 mM C31 accounted for CBS and CSE inhibition by approx. 40% and 60%, respectively. This work, while presenting a robust methodological platform for screening putative inhibitors of the human H2S-synthesizing enzymes, highlights the importance of employing complementary methodologies in compound screenings. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Image features need to be robust against differences in positioning, acquisition and segmentation to ensure reproducibility. Radiomic models that only include robust features can be used to analyse new images, whereas models with non-robust features may fail to predict the outcome of interest accurately. Test-retest imaging is recommended to assess robustness, but may not be available for the phenotype of interest. We therefore investigated 18 combinations of image perturbations to determine feature robustness, based on noise addition (N), translation (T), rotation (R), volume growth/shrinkage (V) and supervoxel-based contour randomisation (C). Test-retest and perturbation robustness were compared for combined total of 4032 morphological, statistical and texture features that were computed from the gross tumour volume in two cohorts with computed tomography imaging: I) 31 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; II): 19 head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Robustness was determined using the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the intraclass correlation coefficient (1, 1). Features with CI ≥ 0:90 were considered robust. The NTCV, TCV, RNCV and RCV perturbation chain produced similar results and identified the fewest false positive robust features (NSCLC: 0.2–0.9%; HNSCC: 1.7–1.9%). Thus, these perturbation chains may be used as an alternative to test-retest imaging to assess feature robustness. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and hypersensitivity to aldehydes and crosslinking agents. For FA patients, gene editing holds promise for therapeutic applications aimed at functionally restoring mutated genes in hematopoietic stem cells. However, intrinsic FA DNA repair defects may obstruct gene editing feasibility. Here, we report on the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of a disruptive mutation in Fancf. Our experiments revealed that gene editing could effectively restore Fancf function via error-prone end joining resulting in a 27% increased survival in the presence of mitomycin C. In addition, templated gene correction could be achieved after double strand or single strand break formation. Although templated gene editing efficiencies were low (≤6%), FA corrected embryonic stem cells acquired a strong proliferative advantage over non-corrected cells, even without imposing genotoxic stress. Notably, Cas9 nickase activity resulted in mono-allelic gene editing and avoidance of undesired mutagenesis. In conclusion: DNA repair defects associated with FANCF deficiency do not prohibit CRISPR/Cas9 gene correction. Our data provide a solid basis for the application of pre-clinical models to further explore the potential of gene editing against FA, with the eventual aim to obtain therapeutic strategies against bone marrow failure. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating data indicates that some cancer treatments can restore anticancer immunosurveillance through the induction of tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD). Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) have been shown to efficiently ablate melanoma tumors. In this study we investigated the mechanisms and immunogenicity of nsPEF-induced cell death in B16F10 melanoma tumors. Our data show that in vitro nsPEF (20–200, 200-ns pulses, 7 kV/cm, 2 Hz) caused a rapid dose-dependent cell death which was not accompanied by caspase activation or PARP cleavage. The lack of nsPEF-induced apoptosis was confirmed in vivo in B16F10 tumors. NsPEF also failed to trigger ICD-linked responses such as necroptosis and autophagy. Our results point at necrosis as the primary mechanism of cell death induced by nsPEF in B16F10 cells. We finally compared the antitumor immunity in animals treated with nsPEF (750, 200-ns, 25 kV/cm, 2 Hz) with animals were tumors were surgically removed. Compared to the naïve group where all animals developed tumors, nsPEF and surgery protected 33% (6/18) and 28.6% (4/14) of the animals, respectively. Our data suggest that, under our experimental conditions, the local ablation by nsPEF restored but did not boost the natural antitumor immunity which stays dormant in the tumor-bearing host. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This study assessed if race and gender predict known sexual risk factors associated with HPV. Data (n = 301) were from a cross-sectional study conducted at a drag racing event on September 12–13, 2015 in Madison, Illinois. Both multivariable logistic and linear regression models estimated the association between race, gender, and sexual risk factors. About 63% of participants were males, and 65% identified as Blacks. Compared to females, males were more likely to have a higher number of oral sexual partners (OR = 2.10; 95% CI: 1.23, 3.57). Males were also more likely to have earlier oral sexual (b = −2.10; 95% CI: −3.60, −0.60) and vaginal sexual (b = −1.10; 95% CI: −1.69, −0.31) debuts compared to females. Blacks were more likely to have higher number of vaginal sexual partners (OR = 3.38; 95% CI: 1.81, 6.31) and earlier vaginal sex (b = −1.09; 95% CI: −1.78, −0.41) but less likely to have earlier oral sexual debuts compared with Whites (b = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.21, −4.13). Because HPV is associated with several cancers, our findings provide impetus for the development of targeted educational interventions aimed at improving the knowledge of these sexual risk factors, especially among men and across race groups. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is a powerful tool to explore cellular heterogeneity. However, most of these methods focus on the 3′-end of polyadenylated transcripts and provide only a partial view of the transcriptome. We introduce C1 CAGE, a method for the detection of transcript 5′-ends with an original sample multiplexing strategy in the C1TM microfluidic system. We first quantifiy the performance of C1 CAGE and find it as accurate and sensitive as other methods in the C1 system. We then use it to profile promoter and enhancer activities in the cellular response to TGF-β of lung cancer cells and discover subpopulations of cells differing in their response.

    "Abstract": "One of the most severe complications after successful cancer therapy is the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). Constitutional genetic variation is likely to impact on t-MN risk. We aimed to evaluate if polymorphisms in the p53 pathway can be useful for predicting t-MN susceptibility. First, an association study revealed that the Pro variant of the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the G allele of the MDM2 SNP309 were associated with t-MN risk. The Arg variant of TP53 is more efficient at inducing apoptosis, whereas the Pro variant is a more potent inductor of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. As regards MDM2 SNP309, the G allele is associated with attenuation of the p53 apoptotic response. Second, to evaluate the biological effect of the TP53 polymorphism, we established Jurkat isogenic cell lines expressing p53Arg or p53Pro. Jurkat p53Arg cells presented higher DNA damage and higher apoptotic potential than p53Pro cells, after treatment with chemotherapy agents. Only p53Pro cells presented t(15;17) translocation and del(5q). We suggest that failure to repair DNA lesions in p53Arg cells would lead them to apoptosis, whereas some p53Pro cells, prone to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, could undergo misrepair, generating chromosomal abnormalities typical of t-MN. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Diffuse astrocytoma (including glioblastoma) is morbid with a worse prognosis than other types of glioma. Therefore, we sought to build a progression-associated score to improve malignancy and prognostic predictions for astrocytoma. The astrocytoma progression (AP) score was constructed through bioinformatics analyses of the training cohort (TCGA RNA-seq) and included 18 genes representing distinct aspects of regulation during astrocytoma progression. This classifier could successfully discriminate patients with distinct prognoses in the training and validation (REMBRANDT, GSE16011 and TCGA-GBM Microarray) cohorts (P < 0.05 in all cohorts) and in different clinicopathological subgroups. Distinct patterns of somatic mutations and copy number variation were also observed. The bioinformatics analyses suggested that genes associated with a higher AP score were significantly involved in cancer progression-related biological processes, such as the cell cycle and immune/inflammatory responses, whereas genes associated with a lower AP score were associated with relatively normal nervous system biological processes. The analyses indicated that the AP score was a robust predictor of patient survival, and its ability to predict astrocytoma malignancy was well elucidated. Therefore, this bioinformatics-based scoring system suggested that astrocytoma progression could distinguish patients with different underlying biological processes and clinical outcomes, facilitate more precise tumour grading and possibly shed light on future classification strategies and therapeutics for astrocytoma patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recent years have seen heat shock protein 90 kDa (Hsp90) attract significant interest as a viable drug target, particularly for cancer. To date, designed inhibitors that target the ATPase domain demonstrate potent anti-proliferative effects, but have failed clinical trials due to high levels of associated toxicity. To circumvent this, the focus has shifted away from the ATPase domain. One option involves modulation of the protein through allosteric activation/inhibition. Here, we propose a novel approach: we use previously obtained information via residue perturbation scanning coupled with dynamic residue network analysis to identify allosteric drug targeting sites for inhibitor docking. We probe the open conformation of human Hsp90α for druggable sites that overlap with these allosteric control elements, and identify three putative natural compound allosteric modulators: Cephalostatin 17, 20(29)-Lupene-3β-isoferulate and 3′-Bromorubrolide F. We assess the allosteric potential of these ligands by examining their effect on the conformational dynamics of the protein. We find evidence for the selective allosteric activation and inhibition of Hsp90’s conformational transition toward the closed state in response to ligand binding and shed valuable insight to further the understanding of allosteric drug design and Hsp90’s complex allosteric mechanism of action. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bicalutamide (Bic) is frequently used in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for treating prostate cancer. ADT-induced hypogonadism was reported to have the potential to lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). ADT was also shown to induce bladder fibrosis via induction of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β level. We hypothesized that Bic can likely induce renal fibrosis. To understand this, a cell model was used to explore expressions of relevant profibrotic proteins. Results indicated that Bic initiated multiple apoptotic and fibrotic pathways, including androgen deprivation, downregulation of the androgen receptor → phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase → Akt pathway, upregulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway- tumor necrosis factor α → nuclear factor κB → caspase-3, increased expressions of fibrosis-related proteins including platelet-derived growth factor β, fibronectin and collagen IV, and enhanced cell migration. The endoplasmic reticular stress pathway and smooth muscle actin were unaffected by Bic. Co-treatment with testosterone was shown to have an anti-apoptotic effect against Bic, suggesting a better outcome of Bic therapy if administered with an appropriate testosterone intervention. However, since Bic was found to inhibit the membrane transport and consumption rates of testosterone, a slightly larger dose of testosterone is recommended. In conclusion, these pathways can be considered to be pharmaceutically relevant targets for drug development in treating the adverse effects of Bic. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recurrence in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) is inevitable resulting in short survival times, even in patients with O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation. Other pathways must be activated to escape from temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, however acquired resistance mechanisms to TMZ are not well understood. Herein, frozen tumors from 36 MGMT methylated patients grouped according to overall survival were extracted and proteins were profiled using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) with time-of flight (TOF) proteomics to identify low molecular weight proteins that associated with poor survival outcomes. Overexpression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was identified in human GBM specimens that were MGMT methylated but showed poor survival. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort of human GBM. MIF overexpression has been reported in several cancer types, including GBM. We repurposed ibudilast, a specific MIF inhibitor, and treated patient derived cell lines. Ibudilast showed modest anti-proliferative activity however, when combined with TMZ, significant synergism was observed, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In vivo, combined ibudilast and TMZ treatment of a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model resulted in significantly longer overall survival. Our findings have significant clinical implications for people with GBM. Since clinical trials involving ibudilast have shown no adverse side effects and the drug readily penetrates the blood brain barrier, treatment of GBM with this combination is clinically achievable. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive tumor of the central nervous system that has poor prognosis despite extensive therapy. Therefore, it is essential to identify a gene expression-based signature for predicting GBM prognosis. The RNA sequencing data of GBM patients from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were employed in our study. The univariate and multivariate regression models were utilized to assess the relative contribution of each gene to survival prediction in both cohorts, and the common genes in two cohorts were identified as a final prognostic model. A prognostic risk score was calculated based on the prognostic gene signature. This prognostic signature stratified the patients into the low- and high-risk groups. Multivariate regression and stratification analyses were implemented to determine whether the gene signature was an independent prognostic factor. We identified a 6-gene signature through univariate and multivariate regression models. This prognostic signature stratified the patients into the low- and high-risk groups, implying improved and poor outcomes respectively. Multivariate regression and stratification analyses demonstrated that the predictive value of the 6-gene signature was independent of other clinical factors. This study highlights the significant implications of having a gene signature as a prognostic predictor in GBM, and its potential application in personalized therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "To find new potentially therapeutic drugs against clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), within drugs currently prescribed for other diseases (drug repositioning), we previously searched for drugs which are expected to bring the gene expression of 500 + ccRCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas closer to that of healthy kidney tissue samples. An inherent limitation of this bulk RNA-seq data is that tumour samples consist of a varying mixture of cancerous and non-cancerous cells, which influences differential gene expression analyses. Here, we investigate whether the drug repositioning candidates are expected to target the genes dysregulated in ccRCC cells by studying the association with tumour purity. When all ccRCC samples are analysed together, the drug repositioning potential of identified drugs start decreasing above 80% estimated tumour purity. Because ccRCC is a highly vascular tumour, attributed to frequent loss of VHL function and subsequent activation of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF), we stratified the samples by observed activation of the HIF-pathway. After stratification, the association between estimated tumour purity and drug repositioning potential disappears for HIF-activated samples. This result suggests that the identified drug repositioning candidates specifically target the genes expressed by HIF-activated ccRCC tumour cells, instead of genes expressed by other cell types part of the tumour micro-environment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To prepare sorafenib-loaded folate-decorated bovine serum nanoparticles (FA-SRF-BSANPs) and investigate their effect on the tumor targeting. METHODS: The nanoparticles were characterized and evaluated by in vivo and in vitro experiments. RESULTS: SRF-loaded BSA nanoparticles (SRF-BSANPs) was first prepared and modified with folic acid by chemical coupling to obtain FA-SRF-BSANPs. The average particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and drug loading of the optimized FA-SRF-BSANPs were 158.00 nm, -16.27 mV, 77.25%, and 7.73%, respectively. The stability test showed that FA-SRF-BSANPs remained stable for more than 1 month at room temperature. The TEM analysis showed that the surface of FA-SRF-BSANPs was nearly spherical. XRD analysis showed that the drug existed in. the nanoparticles in an amorphous state. FA-SRF-BSANPs can promote the intracellular uptake of hepatoma cells (SMMC-7721) with the strongest inhibitory effect compared with SRF-BSANPs and sorafenib solution. Furthermore, the tumor targeting of FA-SRF-BSANPs (Ctumor/Cblood, 0.666 ± 0.053) was significantly higher than those of SRF-BSANPs (Ctumor/Cblood, 0.560 ± 0.083) and sorafenib-solution (Ctumor/Cblood, 0.410 ± 0.038) in nude mice with liver cancer. CONCLUSION: FA-modified albumin nanoparticles are good carriers for delivering SRF to the tumor tissue, which can improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the side effects of the drug.",

    "Abstract": "Appropriate interventions might improve the prevention of essential hypertension. This requires a comprehensive view of modifiable lifestyle factors (MLFs) distribution and effect. To determine how six MLFs (general adiposity, abdominal adiposity, alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, physical inactivity) for risk of hypertension are distributed and how their combinations affect the risk, a prospective study cohort of 11,923 healthy participants from the population-based European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)–Potsdam Study was used. Of these, 1,635 developed hypertension during a mean follow-up of 10.3 years. Mutually exclusive combinations, clustering and interactions of MLFs were then investigated stratifying by sex, Hazard Ratios (HRs) and Population Attributable Risks (PARs%) were calculated. General adiposity alone was sufficient to increase the risk of hypertension (HR = 1.86, PAR% 3.36), and in this cohort it played a major role in enhancing the risk of hypertension, together with smoking and physical inactivity. MLFs had a different impact and a different modulation of risk in women and men, and they showed a remarkable tendency to occur in specific patterns with higher prevalence than expected. This indication can help to promote a holistic approach through multifactorial preventive strategies addressing more than a factor at a time. For prevention of hypertension addressing adiposity together with smoking, promoting at the same time physical activity should be the first choice. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASIL) or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) are precancerous lesions. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in cervical carcinogenesis, but have never been assessed in anal precancerous lesions. Our aim was to evaluate the expression of miR-16, miR-20a, miR-150 and miR-155 in several grades of ASIL obtained from high-risk patients, submitted to anal cancer screening from July 2016 to January 2017. Lesions were classified according to the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) in low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and the AIN classification in AIN1, AIN2 and AIN3. A hundred and five biopsies were obtained from 60 patients. Ten samples were negative (9.5%), 63 were LSIL (60%) and 32 were HSIL (30.5%) according to the LAST. Twenty seven (26%) were negative for dysplasia, 46 were classified as AIN1 (44%), 14 as AIN2 (13%) and 18 as AIN3 (17%) according to the AIN classification. There was no statistically significant difference in the fold expression of miR-16, miR-20a, miR-150 and miR-155, according to either classification. Although non- significant, there was an increasing trend in the miR-155 fold expression from negative samples to HSIL, with the highest fold expression increase in both LSIL and HSIL compared to the other miRNAs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Occupational exposure to silica has been observed to cause pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer through complex mechanisms. Telomeres, the nucleoprotein structures with repetitive (TTAGGG) sequences at the end of chromosomes, are a molecular “clock of life”, and alterations are associated with chronic disease. The shelterin complex (POT1, TRF1, TRF2, Tin2, Rap1, and POT1 and TPP1) plays an important role in maintaining telomere length and integrity, and any alteration in telomeres may activate DNA damage response (DDR) machinery resulting in telomere attrition. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of silica exposure on the regulation of the shelterin complex in an animal model. Male Fisher 344 rats were exposed by inhalation to Min-U-Sil 5 silica for 3, 6, or 12 wk at a concentration of 15 mg/m3 for 6 hr/d for 5 consecutive d/wk. Expression of shelterin complex genes was assessed in the lungs at 16 hr after the end of each exposure. Also, the relationship between increased DNA damage protein (γH2AX) and expression of silica-induced fibrotic marker, αSMA, was evaluated. Our findings reveal new information about the dysregulation of shelterin complex after silica inhalation in rats, and how this pathway may lead to the initiation of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic disorder involving benign mass formation due to fibrosis and intense lymphoplasmacytosis; the chronic inflammation associated with the disease might also contribute to oncogenesis. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), normally expressed in germinal centre activated B-cells, is an enzyme that edits DNA/RNA and induces somatic hypermutation and Ig class switching. AID expression is strictly controlled under physiological conditions; however, chronic inflammation and some infectious agents induce its up-regulation. AID is overexpressed in various cancers and may be important in chronic inflammation-associated oncogenesis. We examined AID expression in IgG4-related sialadenitis (n = 14), sialolithiasis (non-specific inflammation, n = 13), and normal submandibular glands (n = 13) using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly more AID-expressing cells in IgG4-related sialadenitis than in sialolithiasis or normal submandibular gland samples (P = 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively); qPCR yielded similar results. Thus, AID was significantly more up-regulated and had higher expression in extra-germinal centres in IgG4-RD than in non-specific inflammation or normal conditions. This report suggests that IgG4-RD has several specific causes of AID up-regulation in addition to inflammation. Furthermore, chronic inflammation-associated AID-mediated oncogenesis is possible in IgG4-RD. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Radionuclide molecular imaging of human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) expression using affibody molecules could be used for patient stratification for HER3-targeted cancer therapeutics. We hypothesized that the properties of HER3-targeting affibody molecules might be improved through modification of the radiometal-chelator complex. Macrocyclic chelators NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N′,N′′-triacetic acid), NODAGA (1-(1,3-carboxypropyl)-4,7-carboxymethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane), DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid), and DOTAGA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododececane,1-(glutaric acid)−4,7,10-triacetic acid) were conjugated to the C-terminus of anti-HER3 affibody molecule Z08698 and conjugates were labeled with indium-111. All conjugates bound specifically and with picomolar affinity to HER3 in vitro. In mice bearing HER3-expressing xenografts, no significant difference in tumor uptake between the conjugates was observed. Presence of the negatively charged 111In-DOTAGA-complex resulted in the lowest hepatic uptake and the highest tumor-to-liver ratio. In conclusion, the choice of chelator influences the biodistribution of indium-111 labeled anti-HER3 affibody molecules. Hepatic uptake of anti-HER3 affibody molecules could be reduced by the increase of negative charge of the radiometal-chelator complex on the C-terminus without significantly influencing the tumor uptake. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Use of solid phase microextraction (SPME) for cell culture metabolomic analysis allows for the attainment of more sophisticated data from in vitro cell cultures. Moreover, considering that SPME allows the implementation of multiple extractions from the same sample due to its non/low-depletive nature, time course studies using the same set of samples are thus facilitated via this method. Such an approach results in a reduction in the number of samples needed for analysis thus eliminates inter-batch variability related to biological variation occurring during cell culturing. The current work aims to demonstrate the capability of SPME for measurements of combretastatin A4 (CA4) effectiveness on non-small cell cancer cell line. A cultivation protocol was established in the 96-well plate, and a fiber format of SPME was selected for metabolite extraction. The extracellular metabolic pattern of cells was changed after administration of the tested drug. This suggests pharmacological activity of the administered compound towards the studied cell line model. Results support that the use of direct immersion SPME for analysis of cell cultures does not affect cells growth or contaminate sample. Consequently, SPME allows the attainment of accurate information regarding drug uptake, metabolism, and metabolomic changes in the studied cells induced by exposure to the drug simultaneously in a single experiment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ajwa dates (Phoenix dactylifera L.) are used by traditional therapeutic practitioners for several health benefits but most remain to be scientifically validated. In this study, we evaluated the apoptosis-inducing effect of ethanolic extract of Ajwa date pulp (ADP) on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells. High performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed the presence of polysaccharide β-D-glucan in ADP extract. Treated HCC cells revealed morphological characteristics of apoptosis under phase contrast microscopy. MTT assay demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) dose- and time-dependent inhibition of HCC cell growth. HCC cells were found to be in late apoptotic stage on treatment with higher doses of ADP extract as depicted by acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Annexin V-FITC/PI double stain. Importantly, ADP extract increased the reactive oxygen species level and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in treated HCC cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that ADP extract induced elevation of S and G2/M phases of cell cycle. Moreover, ADP extract induced apoptosis in HCC cells independent of tumor suppressor genes viz. CHEK2, ATM and TP53. Interestingly, ADP extract did not display any significant effect on normal cell line Vero. This study provides validation that ADP extract can be considered as a safe and natural potential drug candidate against human liver cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Under hypoxia, most of glucose is converted to secretory lactate, which leads to the overuse of glutamine-carbon. However, under such a condition how glutamine nitrogen is disposed to avoid over-accumulating ammonia remains to be determined. Here we identify a metabolic flux of glutamine to secretory dihydroorotate, which is indispensable to glutamine-carbon metabolism under hypoxia. We found that glutamine nitrogen is necessary to nucleotide biosynthesis, but enriched in dihyroorotate and orotate rather than processing to its downstream uridine monophosphate under hypoxia. Dihyroorotate, not orotate, is then secreted out of cells. Furthermore, we found that the specific metabolic pathway occurs in vivo and is required for tumor growth. The identified metabolic pathway renders glutamine mainly to acetyl coenzyme A for lipogenesis, with the rest carbon and nitrogen being safely removed. Therefore, our results reveal how glutamine carbon and nitrogen are coordinatively metabolized under hypoxia, and provide a comprehensive understanding on glutamine metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) derived parameters can identify oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and lymphatic metastasis. Thirty-nine oesophageal SCC patients underwent DCE-MRI. Quantitative parameters including endothelial transfer constant (K trans ), reflux rate (K ep ), fractional extravascular extracellular space volume and fractional plasma volume, and semi-quantitative parameters including time to peak (TTP), max concentration, Max Slope and area under concentration-time curve of both oesophageal SCC and normal oesophagus were measured. Mann-Whitney U test revealed that K trans and K ep of oesophageal SCC were higher while TTP was shorter when compared to normal oesophagus (all P-values &lt; 0.05); and areas under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves displayed that K ep was superior to TTP or K trans for identifying oesophageal SCC (0.903 vs. 0.832 or 0.713). Mann-Whitney U test also demonstrated that K ep was higher and TTP was shorter in patients with lymphatic metastasis when compared to non-metastatic cancer patients (both P-values &lt; 0.05), and area under ROC curve also showed that TTP was superior to K ep for predicting lymphatic metastasis (0.696 vs. 0.659). In conclusion, the combination of quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters derived from DCE-MRI can aid in the identification of oesophageal SCC and lymphatic metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer sequencing studies have implicated regulators of pre-mRNA splicing as important disease determinants in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. We hypothesized that “non-mutated” splicing regulators may also play a role in AML biology and therefore conducted an in vivo shRNA screen in a mouse model of CEBPA mutant AML. This has led to the identification of the splicing regulator RBM25 as a novel tumor suppressor. In multiple human leukemic cell lines, knockdown of RBM25 promotes proliferation and decreases apoptosis. Mechanistically, we show that RBM25 controls the splicing of key genes, including those encoding the apoptotic regulator BCL-X and the MYC inhibitor BIN1. This mechanism is also operative in human AML patients where low RBM25 levels are associated with high MYC activity and poor outcome. Thus, we demonstrate that RBM25 acts as a regulator of MYC activity and sensitizes cells to increased MYC levels. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor-associated immune response plays a critical role in cancer pathogenesis. This study evaluated clinical implications of T cell cytokines and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in HCC patients treated with TACE. Whole blood was obtained for analysis of T cell cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-22, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) and Tregs from 142 HCC patients. Patients with CTP class A had a significantly lower proportion of detectable IL-4 or IL-6, but a higher proportion of detectable IL-22 than patients with CTP class B/C. IL-6 level was well correlated with tumor stage and undetectable IL-17A was associated with extrahepatic metastasis. The overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients who had undetectable IL-6 or detectable IL-22 than patients who did not. IL-6 among cytokines remained independently predictive factor for survival. Increased IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio and no increase in IL-6 level following TACE were associated with prolonged survival, and baseline Tregs could affect Th1/Th2 balance. T cell cytokines are associated with a variety of clinical aspects of HCC, and IL-6 is the most significant predictor of survival. A shift toward increased Th1 response and no increase in IL-6 level exert favorable immunologic effects on HCC prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The Sialyl Lewis A antigen, or CA 19-9, is the prototype serum biomarker for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Despite extensive clinical study of CA 19-9 in gastrointestinal malignancies, surprisingly little is known concerning the specific cell types that express this marker during development, tissue regeneration and neoplasia. SOX9 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in these processes in foregut tissues. We report the biochemistry and tissue expression of the GCTM-5 antigen, a pancreatic cancer marker related to, but distinct from, CA19-9. This antigen, defined by two monoclonal antibodies recognising separate epitopes on a large glycoconjugate protein complex, is co-expressed with SOX9 by foregut ductal progenitors in the developing human liver and pancreas, and in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These progenitors are distinct from cell populations identified by DCLK1, LGR5, or canonical markers of liver and pancreatic progenitor cells. Co-expression of this antigen complex and SOX9 also characterises the ductal metaplasia of submucosal glands that occurs during the development of Barrett’s oesophagus. The GCTM-5 antigen complex can be detected in the sera of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The GCTM-5 epitope shows a much more restricted pattern of expression in the normal adult pancreas relative to CA19-9. Our findings will aid in the identification, characterisation, and monitoring of ductal progenitor cells during development and progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in man. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The genus Salvia is a valuable origin of structurally diverse terpenoids. In a project directed at structurally interesting bioactive metabolites from Iranian Salvia species, we studied Salvia reuterana. Two new labdane diterpene, 6β, 14α-dihydroxy-15-acetoxysclareol (1), and 14α, 15-dihydroxy sclareol (2), were isolated from the aerial part of the plant. Their structures were established mainly by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques, including 1 H- 1 H COSY, HSQC and HMBC methods and HR-ESI-TOFMS spectral data. Compound 1 and 2 were tested for their inhibitory activity toward HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines. Our results showed that S. reuterana is a rich source of labdane diterpenoids. These compounds are rather rare in Salvia species, although they are frequently found in other genera of the Lamiaceae. S. reuterana is a new source of these diterpenoids. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Much effort has been made to try to understand the relationship between chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer and the immune system. Whereas much of that focus has been on the direct effect of chemotherapy drugs on immune cells and the release of antigens and danger signals by malignant cells killed by chemotherapy, the effect of chemotherapy on cells surviving treatment has often been overlooked. In the present study, tumour cell lines: A549 (lung), HCT116 (colon) and MCF-7 (breast), were treated with various concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drugs cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine (GEM) and oxaliplatin (OXP) for 24 hours in vitro. In line with other reports, GEM and OXP upregulated expression of the death receptor CD95 (fas) on live cells even at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Further investigation revealed that the increase in CD95 in response to GEM sensitised the cells to fas ligand treatment, was associated with increased phosphorylation of stress activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase and that other death receptors and activatory immune receptors were co-ordinately upregulated with CD95 in certain cell lines. The upregulation of death receptors and NKG2D ligands together on cells after chemotherapy suggest that although the cells have survived preliminary treatment with chemotherapy they may now be more susceptible to immune cell-mediated challenge. This re-enforces the idea that chemotherapy-immunotherapy combinations may be useful clinically and has implications for the make-up and scheduling of such treatments. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This work investigated the preparation of specific targeted drug delivery systems in cancer chemotherapy by folate conjugated human serum albumin nanoparticles encapsulated resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles (FA-HSA-RESNPs). FA was coupled to HSA, and RES was encapsulated in FA-conjugated HSA by high pressure fluid nano-homogeneous emulsification. The average particle size and polydispersity index of NPs prepared under optimal conditions were 102.1 ± 4.9 nm and 0.001. The drug capsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency were 98.36 and 14.66%, respectively. The analysis of the results of the physical characterization showed that the RES was present in the FA-HSA-RESNPs in an amorphous state. In vitro drug-release study showed that the NPs can release the drug persistently and slowly. The inhibition rate of FA-HSA-RESNPs and RES was detected using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide method to be 110.8 and 157.2 μM, respectively. The targeting ability of the FA-HSA-RESNPs for the HepG2 cell was measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate-modified albumin techniques. The uptake rate of FA-HSA-RESNPs was higher than that of the original RES. By using near-infrared imaging, in vivo activity was labeled with Cy5 fluorescent FA-HSA-RESNP confirmed FA-HSA-RESNP tumor-targeting ability. The intravenous administration bioavailability of FA-HSA-RESNPs was about 5.95-fold higher than that of the original RES.",

    "Abstract": "Vertebrate fetuins are multi-domain plasma-proteins of the cystatin-superfamily. Human fetuin-A is also known as AHSG, α2-Heremans-Schmid-glycoprotein. Gene-knockout in mice identified fetuin-A as essential for calcified-matrix-metabolism and bone-mineralization. Fetuin-B deficient mice, on the other hand, are female infertile due to zona pellucida ‘hardening’ caused by the metalloproteinase ovastacin in unfertilized oocytes. In wildtype mice fetuin-B inhibits the activity of ovastacin thus maintaining oocytes fertilizable. Here we asked, if fetuins affect further proteases as might be expected from their evolutionary relation to single-domain-cystatins, known as proteinase-inhibitors. We show that fetuin-A is not an inhibitor of any tested protease. In stark contrast, the closely related fetuin-B selectively inhibits astacin-metalloproteinases such as meprins and ovastacin, but not astacins of the tolloid-subfamily, nor any other proteinase. The analysis of fetuin-B expressed in various mammalian cell types, insect cells, and truncated fish-fetuin expressed in bacteria, showed that the cystatin-like domains alone are necessary and sufficient for inhibition. This report highlights fetuin-B as a specific antagonist of ovastacin and meprin-metalloproteinases. Control of ovastacin was shown to be indispensable for female fertility. Meprin inhibition, on the other hand, renders fetuin-B a potential key-player in proteolytic networks controlling angiogenesis, immune-defense, extracellular-matrix-assembly and general cell-signaling, with implications for inflammation, fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "GSK3α has been identified as a new target in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, most GSK3 inhibitors lack specificity for GSK3α over GSK3β and other kinases. We have previously shown in lung cancer cells that GSK3α and to a lesser extent GSK3β are inhibited by the advanced clinical candidate tivantinib (ARQ197), which was designed as a MET inhibitor. Thus, we hypothesized that tivantinib would be an effective therapy for the treatment of AML. Here, we show that tivantinib has potent anticancer activity across several AML cell lines and primary patient cells. Tivantinib strongly induced apoptosis, differentiation and G2/M cell cycle arrest and caused less undesirable stabilization of β-catenin compared to the pan-GSK3 inhibitor LiCl. Subsequent drug combination studies identified the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 to synergize with tivantinib while cytarabine combination with tivantinib was antagonistic. Interestingly, the addition of ABT-199 to tivantinib completely abrogated tivantinib induced β-catenin stabilization. Tivantinib alone, or in combination with ABT-199, downregulated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-XL levels, which likely contribute to the observed synergy. Importantly, tivantinib as single agent or in combination with ABT-199 significantly inhibited the colony forming capacity of primary patient AML bone marrow mononuclear cells. In summary, tivantinib is a novel GSK3α/β inhibitor that potently kills AML cells and tivantinib single agent or combination therapy with ABT-199 may represent attractive new therapeutic opportunities for AML. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Since the early detection of cancer increases the chance of successful treatment, the present study focused to confirm the suitability of an indigenously fabricated multilayer PCB technology based 3D positive ion detector to detect breast and lung malignancy at an early stage. The 3D positive ion detector is a type of gas filled radiation detector works under the principle of ion induced ionization using an exempted micro curie activity source. Earlier studies report that malignant cells can be detected by analyzing the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) exhaled by those cells that serve as eminent biomarkers for malignant detection. Based on this, the present study analyzed the signals produced in the detector by VOCs exhaled from 140 biopsy tissue samples that include tissue of normal and all stages of breast and lung malignancy. To strengthen the present data, the normal and advanced breast and lung malignant tissues were also analyzed using the Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). From this study, it is confirmed that the present 3D positive ion detector can be used to detect both breast and lung malignancy and also to distinguish them based on the variation in four basic physical parameters of the output pulse such as frequency, amplitude, rise time and fall time and four derived parameters of the pulse such as FWHM, area of the pulse, ionization cluster size, and ion drift time. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In Drosophila, a complex consisting of Calypso and ASX catalyzes H2A deubiquitination and has been reported to act as part of the Polycomb machinery in transcriptional silencing. The mammalian homologs of these proteins (BAP1 and ASXL1/2/3, respectively), are frequently mutated in various cancer types, yet their precise functions remain unclear. Using an integrative approach based on isogenic cell lines generated with CRISPR/Cas9, we uncover an unanticipated role for BAP1 in gene activation. This function requires the assembly of an enzymatically active BAP1-associated core complex (BAP1.com) containing one of the redundant ASXL proteins. We investigate the mechanism underlying BAP1.com-mediated transcriptional regulation and show that it does not participate in Polycomb-mediated silencing. Instead, our results establish that the function of BAP1.com is to safeguard transcriptionally active genes against silencing by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Dysregulation in NAD + /NADH levels is associated with increased cell division and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Conversion of the ketone body acetoacetate (AcAc) to β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) by the mitochondrial enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH) depends upon NADH availability. The β-HB-to-AcAc ratio is therefore expected to reflect mitochondrial redox. Previous studies reported the potential of hyperpolarized 13 C-AcAc to monitor mitochondrial redox in cells, perfused organs and in vivo. However, the ability of hyperpolarized 13 C-AcAc to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and its potential to monitor brain metabolism remained unknown. Our goal was to assess the value of hyperpolarized [1,3- 13 C 2 ]AcAc in healthy and tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Following hyperpolarized [1,3- 13 C 2 ]AcAc injection, production of [1,3- 13 C 2 ]β-HB was detected in normal and tumor-bearing mice. Significantly higher levels of [1- 13 C]AcAc and lower [1- 13 C]β-HB-to-[1- 13 C]AcAc ratios were observed in tumor-bearing mice. These results were consistent with decreased BDH activity in tumors and associated with increased total cellular NAD + /NADH. Our study confirmed that AcAc crosses the BBB and can be used for monitoring metabolism in the brain. It highlights the potential of AcAc for future clinical translation and its potential utility for monitoring metabolic changes associated with glioma, and other neurological disorders. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nuclear nanomedicine, with its targeting ability and heavily loading capacity, along with its enhanced retention to avoid rapid clearance as faced with molecular radiopharmaceuticals, provides unique opportunities to treat tumors and metastasis. Despite these promises, this field has seen limited activities, primarily because of a lack of suitable nanocarriers, which are safe, excretable and have favorable pharmacokinetics to efficiently deliver and retain radionuclides in a tumor. Here, we introduce biodegradable laser-synthesized Si nanoparticles having round shape, controllable low-dispersion size, and being free of any toxic impurities, as highly suitable carriers of therapeutic 188 Re radionuclide. The conjugation of the polyethylene glycol-coated Si nanoparticles with radioactive 188 Re takes merely 1 hour, compared to its half-life of 17 hours. When intravenously administered in a Wistar rat model, the conjugates demonstrate free circulation in the blood stream to reach all organs and target tumors, which is radically in contrast with that of the 188 Re salt that mostly accumulates in the thyroid gland. We also show that the nanoparticles ensure excellent retention of 188 Re in tumor, not possible with the salt, which enables one to maximize the therapeutic effect, as well as exhibit a complete time-delayed conjugate bioelimination. Finally, our tests on rat survival demonstrate excellent therapeutic effect (72% survival compared to 0% of the control group). Combined with a series of imaging and therapeutic functionalities based on unique intrinsic properties of Si nanoparticles, the proposed biodegradable complex promises a major advancement in nuclear nanomedicine. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we investigated the loading and conjugation of Curcumin on oleic acid (OA) and citric acid (CA) functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles and its applications in improving contrast in MRI. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 , MNPs) were synthesized using the co-precipitation method and characterized by XRD, DLS, FT-IR, VSM, and SEM. FT-IR results confirmed functionalization with oleic acid and citric acid. Curcumin was loaded and conjugated with the Nano-Systems and the amount of Curcumin loaded was quantified using spectrophotometry at 419 nm wavelength. The impact of solvent on the loading of Curcumin was studied. The wt% of loaded Curcumin was found to be 0.189 wt% using dimethylformamide (DMF) whereas using a combination of water-ethanol (15% v/v), this increased to 56.149 wt%. T2 relaxation time was determined using a 1.5 Tesla MRI machine; results showed that the MNPs reduced T2. Cytotoxicity of Nano-Systems (NS) in MTT assay showed that concentrations higher than 80 μg/mL (C NS &gt; 80 μg/mL) could lead to cancer cell death and low concentrations, up to 40 μg/mL (C NS &lt; 40 μg/mL) could be evaluated for diagnostic purposes. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "The Hippo pathway plays an important role in organ development and adult tissue homeostasis, and its deregulation has been implicated in many cancers. The Hippo signaling relies on a core kinase cascade culminating in phosphorylation of the transcription coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Although Yki is the key effector of Hippo pathway, the regulation of its protein stability is still unclear. Here, we show that Hippo pathway attenuates the binding of a ubiquitin-specific protease Usp7 to Yki, which regulates Hippo signaling through deubiquitinating Yki. Furthermore, the mammalian homolog of Usp7, HAUSP plays a conserved role in regulating Hippo pathway by modulating Yap ubiquitination and degradation. Finally, we find that the expression of HAUSP is positively correlated with that of Yap, both showing upregulated levels in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. In summary, our findings demonstrate that Yki/Yap is stabilized by Usp7/HAUSP, and provide HAUSP as a potential therapeutic target for HCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The gut microbiota has been linked to various neurological disorders via the gut–brain axis. Diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet established for treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy in children. Its efficacy in reducing seizures has been confirmed, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The diet has also shown positive effects in a wide range of other diseases, including Alzheimer’s, depression, autism, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. We collected fecal samples from 12 children with therapy-resistant epilepsy before starting KD and after 3 months on the diet. Parents did not start KD and served as diet controls. Applying shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, both taxonomic and functional profiles were established. Here we report that alpha diversity is not changed significantly during the diet, but differences in both taxonomic and functional composition are detected. Relative abundance of bifidobacteria as well as E. rectale and Dialister is significantly diminished during the intervention. An increase in relative abundance of E. coli is observed on KD. Functional analysis revealed changes in 29 SEED subsystems including the reduction of seven pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decomposition of these shifts indicates that bifidobacteria and Escherichia are important contributors to the observed functional shifts. As relative abundance of health-promoting, fiber-consuming bacteria becomes less abundant during KD, we raise concern about the effects of the diet on the gut microbiota and overall health. Further studies need to investigate whether these changes are necessary for the therapeutic effect of KD. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Myofibroblasts are the key effector cells responsible for excessive extracellular matrix deposition in multiple fibrotic conditions, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis has been implicated in fibrosis, with pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibition currently under clinical evaluation in IPF. Here we demonstrate that rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 signaling via 4E-BP1 is a critical pathway for TGF-β 1 stimulated collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblasts, whereas canonical PI3K/Akt signaling is not required. The importance of mTORC1 signaling was confirmed by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in normal and IPF fibroblasts, as well as in lung cancer-associated fibroblasts, dermal fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells. The inhibitory effect of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibition extended to other matrisome proteins implicated in the development of fibrosis and human disease relevance was demonstrated in live precision-cut IPF lung slices. Our data demonstrate that the mTORC1/4E-BP1 axis represents a critical signaling node during fibrogenesis with potential implications for the development of novel anti-fibrotic strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The presence of leukocyte subpopulations in malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) can have a different impact on tumor cell proliferation and vascular leakiness, their analysis can help to understand the metastatic microenvironment. We analyzed the relationship between the leukocyte subpopulation counts per ml of pleural fluid and the tumor cell count, molecular phenotype of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), time from cancer diagnosis and previous oncologic therapy. We also evaluated the leukocyte composition of MPEs as a biomarker of prognosis. We determined CD4+ T, CD8+ T and CD20+ B cells, monocytes and neutrophils per ml in pleural effusions of 22 LAC and 10 heart failure (HF) patients by flow cytometry. Tumor cells were identified by morphology and CD326 expression. IFNγ, IL-10 and IL-17, and chemokines were determined by ELISAs and migratory response to pleural fluids by transwell assays. MPEs from LAC patients had more CD8+ T lymphocytes and a tendency to more CD4+ T and CD20+ B lymphocytes than HF-related fluids. However, no correlation was found between lymphocytes and tumor cells. In those MPEs which were detected >1 month from LAC diagnosis, there was a negative correlation between pleural tumor cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes. CXCL10 was responsible for the attraction of CD20+ B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes in malignant fluids. Concentrations of IL-17 were higher in MPEs than in HF-related effusions. Survival after MPE diagnosis correlated positively with CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes, but negatively with neutrophils and IL-17 levels. In conclusion, lymphocyte enrichment in MPEs from LAC patients is mostly due to local migration and increases patient survival. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The global prevalence of diabetes is high and rapidly increasing. Some previous studies have found that vegetarians might have a lower risk of diabetes than non-vegetarians. Objective: We examined the association between vegetarianism and risk of hospitalisation or death with diabetes in a large, prospective cohort study of British adults. Methods: The analysed cohort included participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford study who were diabetes free at recruitment (1993–2001), with available dietary intake data at baseline, and linked hospital admissions and death data for diabetes over follow-up (n = 45,314). Participants were categorised as regular meat eaters (≥50 g per day: n = 15,181); low meat eaters (<50 g of meat per day: n = 7615); fish eaters (ate no meat but consumed fish: n = 7092); and vegetarians (ate no meat or fish, including vegans: n = 15,426). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations between diet group and risk of diabetes. Results: Over a mean of 17.6 years of follow-up, 1224 incident cases of diabetes were recorded. Compared with regular meat eaters, the low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians were less likely to develop diabetes (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54–0.75; HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.38–0.59; and HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.54–0.74, respectively). These associations were substantially attenuated after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) (low meat eaters: HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66–0.92; fish eaters: HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.51–0.80; and vegetarians: HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.76–1.05). Conclusions: Low meat and non-meat eaters had a lower risk of diabetes, in part because of a lower BMI. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Systems biology perspectives are crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of complex diseases, and therefore hold great promise for the discovery of novel treatment strategies. Drug combinations have been shown to improve durability and reduce resistance to available first-line therapies in a variety of cancers; however, traditional drug discovery approaches are prohibitively cost and labor-intensive to evaluate large-scale matrices of potential drug combinations. Computational methods are needed to efficiently model complex interactions of drug target pathways and identify mechanisms underlying drug combination synergy. In this study, we employ a computational approach, SynGeNet (Synergy from Gene expression and Network mining), which integrates transcriptomics-based connectivity mapping and network centrality analysis to analyze disease networks and predict drug combinations. As an exemplar of a disease in which combination therapies demonstrate efficacy in genomic-specific contexts, we investigate malignant melanoma. We employed SynGeNet to generate drug combination predictions for each of the four major genomic subtypes of melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, NF1, and triple wild type) using publicly available gene expression and mutation data. We validated synergistic drug combinations predicted by our method across all genomic subtypes using results from a high-throughput drug screening study across. Finally, we prospectively validated the drug combination for BRAF-mutant melanoma that was top ranked by our approach, vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) + tretinoin (retinoic acid receptor agonist), using both in vitro and in vivo models of BRAF-mutant melanoma and RNA-sequencing analysis of drug-treated melanoma cells to validate the predicted mechanisms. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of disease domains, and, importantly, can model disease-relevant protein subnetworks in precision medicine contexts. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Prostate diseases include prostate cancer, which is the second most common male neoplasia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which affects approximately 50% of men. The incidence of prostate disease is increasing, and some of this increase may be attributable to ancestral exposure to environmental toxicants and epigenetic transgenerational inheritance mechanisms. The goal of the current study was to determine the effects that exposure of gestating female rats to vinclozolin has on the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate disease, and to characterize by what molecular epigenetic mechanisms this has occurred. Gestating female rats (F0 generation) were exposed to vinclozolin during E8-E14 of gestation. F1 generation offspring were bred to produce the F2 generation, which were bred to produce the transgenerational F3 generation. The transgenerational F3 generation vinclozolin lineage males at 12 months of age had an increased incidence of prostate histopathology and abnormalities compared to the control lineage. Ventral prostate epithelial and stromal cells were isolated from F3 generation 20-day old rats, prior to the onset of pathology, and used to obtain DNA and RNA for analysis. Results indicate that there were transgenerational changes in gene expression, noncoding RNA expression, and DNA methylation in both cell types. Our results suggest that ancestral exposure to vinclozolin at a critical period of gestation induces the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate stromal and epithelial cell changes in both the epigenome and transcriptome that ultimately lead to prostate disease susceptibility and may serve as a source of the increased incidence of prostate pathology observed in recent years. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Raf kinases are downstream effectors of small GTPase Ras. Mutations in Ras and Raf are associated with a variety of cancers and genetic disorders. Of the three Raf isoforms, cRaf is most frequently involved in tumor initiation by Ras. Cytosolic Raf is auto-inhibited and becomes active upon recruitment to the plasma membrane. Since the catalytic domain of Raf is its kinase domain, we ask the following: does the kinase domain of Raf has potential to interact with membrane and if yes, what role does the membrane interaction play? We present a model of cRaf kinase domain in complex with a heterogeneous membrane bilayer using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. We show that the kinase domain of cRaf has three distinct membrane-interacting regions: a polybasic motif (R.RKTR) from the regulatory αC-helix, an aromatic/hydrophobic cluster from the N-terminal acidic region (NtA) and positively charged/aromatic cluster from the activation segment (AS). We show that residues from these regions form an extended membrane-interacting surface that resembles the membrane-interacting residues from known membrane-binding domains. Activating phosphorylatable regions (NtA and AS), make direct contact with the membrane whereas R.RKTR forms specific multivalent salt bridges with PA. PA lipids dwell for longer times around the R.RKTR motif. Our results suggest that membrane interaction of monomeric cRaf kinase domain likely orchestrates the Raf activation process and modulates its function. We show that R.RKTR is a hotspot that interacts with membrane when cRaf is monomeric and becomes part of the interface upon Raf dimerization. We propose that in terms of utilizing a specific hotspot to form membrane interaction and dimer formation, both Raf and its upstream binding partner KRas, are similar. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Hemophilia A (HA) is an inherited and rare X-linked bleeding disorder which is caused by mutations of the factor VIII gene (FVIII). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding sequence transcripts containing more than 200 nucleotides and have potential in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cancers and inherited bleeding disorders like thalassemia. The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between the expression of lncRNAs and the incidence of hemophilia A in Iranian population. METHODS: In this study, after bioinformatics analysis and lncRNA identification, the expression of two lncRNAs including NONHSAT139215 and NONHSAT139219 was investigated among the blood samples of severe hemophilia A and healthy (non-hemophilia) subjects using the relative qRT-PCR technique. RESULTS: The melting curve analysis confirmed the specificity of primers. Also, the standard curve showed that the efficiency of reactions for β2-microglobulin (B2M), NONHSAT139215 and NONHSAT139219 was 1.91, 1.96 and 2.01, respectively. On the other hand, the statistical analysis using REST software indicated that the expression of NONHSAT139219 and NONHSAT139215 in severe HA patients was significantly down-regulated as compared to control group (p < .05). DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrated that a decrease in the expression of two lncRNAs located in FVIII gene may play an important role for the development of severe hemophilia A for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Briefly, the abnormal expression levels of lncRNAs in hemophilia A cases may be correlated with disease intensity. However, further studies of these lncRNAs are required to provide a useful insight into hemophilia biology.",

    "Abstract": "Glycine-N-methyl transferase (GNMT) a tumor suppressor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) plays a crucial role in liver homeostasis. Its expression is downregulated in almost all the tumor tissues of HCC while the mechanism of this downregulation is not yet fully understood. Recently, we identified 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (PGG) as a GNMT promoter enhancer compound in HCC. In this study, we aimed to delineate the mechanism by which PGG enhances GNMT expression and to investigate its effect on GNMT suppression in HCC. Microarray and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that MYC was a major target of PGG. PGG suppressed MYC mRNA and protein expression in Huh7 and Hep G2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, MYC expression was also reduced in xenograft tumors in PGG treated mice. Moreover, shRNA-mediated knocked-down or pharmacological inhibition of MYC resulted in a significant induction of GNMT promoter activity and endogenous GNMT mRNA expression in Huh7 cells. In contrast, overexpression of MYC significantly inhibited GNMT promoter activity and endogenous GNMT protein expression. In addition, antibodies against MYC effectively precipitated the human GNMT promoter in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Lastly, GNMT expression was negatively correlated with MYC expression in human HCC samples. Interestingly, PGG not only inhibited MYC gene expression but also promoted MYC protein degradation through proteasome-independent pathways. This work reveals a novel anticancer mechanism of PGG via downregulation of MYC expression and establishes a therapeutic rationale for treatment of MYC overexpressing cancers using PGG. Our data also provide a novel mechanistic understanding of GNMT regulation through MYC in the pathogenesis of HCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ustilaginoidins are a kind of mycotoxins with 9,9′-linked bis-naphtho-γ-pyrones structures produced by the rice false smut pathogen Villosiclava virens. These metabolites displayed a wide range of bioactivities, such as teratogenic, cytotoxic, phytotoxic, and antibacterial activities. So far 26 ustilaginoidins have been isolated from V. virens, among which 18 compounds contained stereogenic center(s), however, most of them were unknown for the absolute configurations, except that of ustilaginoidin D. In this study, the absolute structures of these ustilaginoidins were constructed for the first time by analysis of the biosynthetic monomers obtained from a gene knockout mutant (ΔUV_2091) of V. virens. The gene UV_2091 was predicted to encode an enzyme that dimerized the monomeric naphtho-γ-pyrones in V. virens. Knockout of this gene led to the accumulation of three monomers, namely hemiustilaginoidin F (1), epihemiustilaginoidin D (2), and hemiustilaginoidin D (3), but the production of ustilaginoidins was completely blocked. The structures of the monomers were deduced by spectroscopic analysis, in combination with TDDFT ECD calculations for determining the absolute configurations. These compounds were tested for their phytotoxic, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. Compounds 1 and 3 showed inhibition against the radicle and plumule elongation of rice and lettuce seeds at the tested concentrations. Compound 1 was active against the tested five human cancer cells, with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of 13.2~37.3 μM. Compounds 1~3 inhibited the growth of the tested pathogenic bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 8~32 µg/mL, while compound 3 exhibited antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae (IC 50 , 5.21 µg/mL). A comparison of these data with those of the ustilaginoidins provided insights into the structure-bioactivity relationships. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Because of its association with severe gastric pathologies, including gastric cancer, Helicobacter pylori has been subject of research for more than 30 years. Its capacity to adapt and survive in the human stomach can be attributed to its genetic flexibility. Its natural competence and its capacity to turn genes on and off allows H. pylori to adapt rapidly to the changing conditions of its host. Because of its genetic variability, it is difficult to establish the uniqueness of each strain obtained from a human host. The methods considered to-date to deliver the best result for differentiation of strains are Rapid Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis. While RAPD analysis is cost-effective, it requires a stable genome for its reliability. MLST and WGS are optimal for strain identification, however, they require analysis of data at the bioinformatics level. Using the StainFree method, which modifies tryptophan residues on proteins using 2, 2, 2, - trichloroethanol (TCE), we observed a strain specific pattern of tryptophan in 1D acrylamide gels. In order to establish the effectiveness of tryptophan fingerprinting for strain identification, we compared the graphic analysis of tryptophan-labelled bands in the gel images with MLST results. Based on this, we find that tryptophan banding patterns can be used as an alternative method for the differentiation of H. pylori strains. Furthermore, investigating the origin for these differences, we found that H. pylori strains alters the number and/or position of tryptophan present in several proteins at the genetic code level, with most exchanges taking place in membrane- and cation-binding proteins, which could be part of a novel response of H. pylori to host adaptation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Latin Americans and Chilean Amerindians have the highest prevalence of gallstone disease (GSD) and gallbladder cancer (GBC) in the world. A handful of loci have been associated with GSD in populations of predominantly European ancestry, however, they only explain a small portion of the genetic component of the disease. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for GSD in 1,095 admixed Chilean Latinos with Mapuche Native American ancestry. Disease status was assessed by cholecystectomy or abdominal ultrasonography. Top-10 candidate variants surpassing the suggestive cutoff of P &lt; 1 × 10 −5 in the discovery cohort were genotyped in an independent replication sample composed of 1,643 individuals. Variants with positive replication were further examined in two European GSD populations and a Chilean GBC cohort. We consistently replicated the association of ABCG8 gene with GSD (rs11887534, P = 3.24 × 10 −8 , OR = 1.74) and identified TRAF3 (rs12882491, P = 1.11 × 10 −7 , OR = 1.40) as a novel candidate gene for the disease in admixed Chilean Latinos. ABCG8 and TRAF3 variants also conferred risk to GBC. Gene expression analyses indicated that TRAF3 was significantly decreased in gallbladder (P = 0.015) and duodenal mucosa (P = 0.001) of GSD individuals compared to healthy controls, where according to GTEx data in the small intestine, the presence of the risk allele contributes to the observed effect. We conclude that ABCG8 and TRAF3 genes are associated with GSD and GBC in admixed Latinos and that decreased TRAF3 levels could enhance gallbladder inflammation as is observed in GSD and GSD-associated GBC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Few studies implicate immunoregulatory gene expression in tumor cells in arbitrating brain tumor progression. Here we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) is highly expressed in glioma stem cells and primary glioblastoma (GBM) cells. FGL2 knockout in tumor cells did not affect tumor-cell proliferation in vitro or tumor progression in immunodeficient mice but completely impaired GBM progression in immune-competent mice. This impairment was reversed in mice with a defect in dendritic cells (DCs) or CD103 + DC differentiation in the brain and in tumor-draining lymph nodes. The presence of FGL2 in tumor cells inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-induced CD103 + DC differentiation by suppressing NF-κB, STAT1/5, and p38 activation. These findings are relevant to GBM patients because a low level of FGL2 expression with concurrent high GM-CSF expression is associated with higher CD8B expression and longer survival.

    "Abstract": "We investigated the physiological functions of Myo10 (myosin X) using Myo10 reporter knockout (Myo10 tm2 ) mice. Full-length (motorized) Myo10 protein was deleted, but the brain-specific headless (Hdl) isoform (Hdl-Myo10) was still expressed in homozygous mutants. In vitro, we confirmed that Hdl-Myo10 does not induce filopodia, but it strongly localized to the plasma membrane independent of the MyTH4-FERM domain. Filopodia-inducing Myo10 is implicated in axon guidance and mice lacking the Myo10 cargo protein DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) have severe commissural defects, whereas MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of isolated brains revealed intact commissures in Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice. However, reminiscent of Waardenburg syndrome, a neural crest disorder, Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice exhibited pigmentation defects (white belly spots) and simple syndactyly with high penetrance (&gt;95%), and 24% of mutant embryos developed exencephalus, a neural tube closure defect. Furthermore, Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice consistently displayed bilateral persistence of the hyaloid vasculature, revealed by MRI and retinal whole-mount preparations. In principle, impaired tissue clearance could contribute to persistence of hyaloid vasculature and syndactyly. However, Myo10-deficient macrophages exhibited no defects in the phagocytosis of apoptotic or IgG-opsonized cells. RNA sequence analysis showed that Myo10 was the most strongly expressed unconventional myosin in retinal vascular endothelial cells and expression levels increased 4-fold between P6 and P15, when vertical sprouting angiogenesis gives rise to deeper layers. Nevertheless, imaging of isolated adult mutant retinas did not reveal vascularization defects. In summary, Myo10 is important for both prenatal (neural tube closure and digit formation) and postnatal development (hyaloid regression, but not retinal vascularization). © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite increasingly growth in waterpipe smoking in Tehran, so far no study has been conducted on the air quality of the waterpipe and cigarette cafés. Thirty-six cafés were selected and the concentration of three pollutants including formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and nicotine were measured in both indoor and outdoor air of cafés two times (week-day and weekend’s session). Air sampling was performed for 180 min for each pollutant. It was observed that the concentration of pollutants inside the cafés was higher during weekend session (with a higher number of “active waterpipe heads”) compared with findings during the week-day sessions. Furthermore, the concentration of pollutants in the indoor air of the cafés was significantly higher than that of the outdoors (p &lt; 0.05). According to path analysis, the number of “active waterpipe heads” had the maximum impact on generation of pollutants inside the cafés, followed by the type of tobacco as the second influential factor. The average of lifetime cancer risk (LTCR) resulted by formaldehyde exposure through inhalation in waterpipe (WS), cigarette (CS), waterpipe and cigarette (WCS) and none-smoking (NS) cafés in week-day and weekend sessions were estimated to be 111 × 10 −5 and 61.2 × 10 −5 , 33.7 × 10 −5 and 39.4 × 10 −5 , 271 × 10 −5 and 322 × 10 −5 , and 4.80 × 10 −5 and 5.90 × 10 −5 , respectively, which exceed the limit value by the U.S.EPA and WHO. The concentration of pollutants in the indoor air of smoking cafés in Tehran is significantly high, such that it can pose serious risks for the health of both personnel and customers. Therefore, decision makers are expected to enact applicable and strict policies so as to abate this public health risk. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The present research seeks to investigate the process of mixing targeted gene delivery and transcriptional targeting. We have conjugated Polyethylenimine polymers (PEI) and molecules of poly (ethylene glycol). The next step was covalent attachment of anti-HER2 variables domains of camelid heavy chains antibodies (VHHs) or nanobodies (Nbs) to the distal terminals of NHS-PEG3500 in PEI-PEG nanoparticles. The whole procedure yielded PEI-PEG-Nb immunoconjugates. Having determined the properties of polyplexes, steps were taken to investigate the most efficient ratio of PEI polymers to pDNA molecules (N/P) so that the greatest rate of transfection may be obtained. This immune targeted nano biopolymer could condense the gene constructs that coded a transcriptionally targeted truncated -Bid (tBid) killer gene which was controlled by the breast cancer-specific MUC1 promoter. The favourable physicochemical properties matching both the size and zeta potential were observed in engineered polyplexes. Elevated transfection efficiency in HER2 positive cell lines using Nb-modified polyplexes were shown by the results of flow cytometry as compared against non-modified particles. 1.6 and 4.8 fold higher transfection efficiencies were observed in in vitro gene expression researches which used PEI-PEG-Nb/pGL4.50 compared to the situation when native PEI polymers were utilized in both BT-474 and SK-BR-3, respectively. A 2.22 and 3.62 fold rise in the level of tBid gene expression in BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cell lines relative to unmodified PEI treated cells was the result of transfection with PEI-PEG-Nb/pMUC1-tBid, respectively. In those HER2-positive cells which were transfected by targeted polyplexes, higher levels of cell death were observed. This fact points not only to the effective targeted delivery, but it is also indicative of transcriptional targeting efficiency of tBid killer gene when its expression is controlled by MUC1 promoter.",

    "Abstract": "Oliveria decumbens is an aromatic plant traditionally used for treatment of infections and gastrointestinal diseases. In the present study, the volatile oil of the plant was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. In addition, antibacterial and anti-Helicobacter pylori activities of this essential oil were determined using disc diffusion and agar dilution methods, respectively. Insecticidal activity was assessed through topical and fumigation application of the essential oil to cabbage looper larvae. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition by the essential oil was examined using Ellman’s method. Furthermore, its cytotoxic potential against three different cancer cell lines was assessed using the MTT assay. The phenolic monoterpenoids, thymol (38.79%), and carvacrol (36.30%) were identified as major constituents of the essential oil. We observed significant antibacterial activity of the essential oil against H. pylori (MIC=20.4 µg /mL) as well as other tested bacteria, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. O. decumbens essential oil showed significant toxicity to cabbage looper larvae with LD 50 value of 52.1 µg /larva following topical and fumigant administration. O. decumbens essential oil was considerably inhibitory to acetylcholinesterase activity (IC50 = 0.117 µg/mL). Cytotoxic assay of the volatile oil resulted in IC50 = 0.065, 0.104, and 0.141 μg/mL for MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively. According to our data, this species with high concentrations of thymol and carvacrol could be considered as a natural source for pharmaceutical products. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "CONTEXT: γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter and it is well established that activation of GABAA receptors favours sleep. l-Theanine, a naturally occurring amino acid first discovered in green tea, is a well-known anti-anxiety supplement with proven relaxation benefits. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the potential synergistic sleep enhancement effect of GABA/l-theanine mixture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pentobarbital-induced sleep test was applied to find proper concentration for sleep-promoting effect in ICR mice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis was performed to investigate total sleeping time and sleep quality in normal SD rats and caffeine-induced awareness model. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to investigate whether the sleep-promoting mechanism of GABA/l-theanine mixture involved transcriptional processes. RESULTS: GABA/l-theanine mixture (100/20 mg/kg) showed a decrease in sleep latency (20.7 and 14.9%) and an increase in sleep duration (87.3 and 26.8%) compared to GABA or theanine alone. GABA/l-theanine mixture led to a significant increase in rapid eye movement (REM) (99.6%) and non-REM (NREM) (20.6%) compared to controls. The use of GABA/l-theanine mixture rather than GABA or l-theanine alone restored to normal levels sleep time and quality in the arousal animal model. The administration of GABA/l-theanine led to increased expression of GABA and the glutamate GluN1 receptor subunit. CONCLUSIONS: GABA/l-theanine mixture has a positive synergistic effect on sleep quality and duration as compared to the GABA or l-theanine alone. The increase in GABA receptor and GluN1 expression is attributed to the potential neuromodulatory properties of GABA/l-theanine combination, which seems to affect sleep behaviour.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interstitial low dose rate brachyther-apy is established organ spar-ing treatment of T1-&#8202;T2 penile carcinoma. Experience with high-dose rate brachyther-apy is limited in this indication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with early penile carcinoma were treated by high-dose rate brachyther-apy at dose 18 × 3 Gy per fraction twice daily between 2002-&#8202;2018 at the Department of Oncology and Radiother-apy, University Hospital in Hradec Kralove. Breast interstitial brachyther-apy template was used for fixation and precise geometry reconstruction of stainless hollow needles. RESULTS: Median follow up was 85 months (range 7-&#8202;200 months). Acute reaction usually consisted of grade 2 mucositis that dissolved dur-ing 8 weeks after the treatment. Local recurrence occurred in 6 patients, 5 of them were successfully treated with partial amputation. One patient had a nodal recurrence successfully salvaged by lymphadenectomy. One patient developed necrosis of the glans requir-ing partial amputation. Currently, there are 24 patients alive without signs of dis-ease. One patient died of cardiac comorbidity, one died of duplicate lung cancer. Nineteen patients have a preserved penis (73%), 18 of them sexually active before treatment report satisfactory intercourse. CONCLUSION: Hyperfractionated interstitial high-dose rate brachyther-apy with 18 × 3 Gy per fraction twice daily is a promis-ing method in selected patients with penile carcinoma and deserves further evaluation in a larger prospective study.

    "Abstract": "Melanoma is a challenging disease to treat. Punica granatum L. has a potential anticancer effect. This study determined the antiproliferative and antiangiogenic potential of the extract from pomegranate pericarp (PPE) in melanoma. Melanoma cells (1 × 10 6 ) were injected to C57BL6 mice subcutaneously. On 8 th day, mice were randomly divided into 9 groups. Group 1 was considered as control and received distilled water. Groups 2 to 5 received 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg of standardized PPE, orally. Group 6 received 400 mg/kg PPE and PPAR-γ antagonist (T0070907, 5 mg/kg/day). Group 7 received 400 mg/kg PPE and PPAR-α antagonist (GW6471, 10 mg/kg/day). Groups 8 and 9 received PPAR antagonists alone. On the 16 th day, mice were euthanized and the tumor samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining for Ki-67 and CD31. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plasma level was determined by ELISA. PPE at the doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg decreased tumor weight to 1.28, 1.03, 0.82, and 0.58 g, respectively, in comparison with 1.46 g in control group. Tumor volume reduced to 2.1, 1.7, 1.35 and 0.95 cm 3 at the mentioned doses, in comparison with 2.4 cm 3 in control group (P &lt; 0.05 for all groups). VEGF, Ki-67 and CD31 were decreased dose dependently in the treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05). PPARα and PPARγ antagonists significantly reduced the extract effects (P &lt; 0.05). It was concluded that PPE may have a potential implication in melanoma treatment through activation of PPARα and PPARγ receptors. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "The further optimization of ER-α degradation efficacy of a series of ER modulators by refining side-chain substitution led to efficacious selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). A fluoromethyl azetidine group was found to be preferred and resulted in the identification of bis-phenol chromene 17ha. In a tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer xenograft model, 17ha (ER-α degradation efficacy = 97%) demonstrated tumor regression, together with robust reduction of intratumoral ER-α levels. However, despite superior oral exposure, 5a (ER-α degradation efficacy = 91%) had inferior activity. This result suggests that optimizing ER-α degradation efficacy leads to compounds with robust effects in a model of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. Compound 17ha (GDC-0927) was evaluated in clinical trials in women with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cats spontaneously develop invasive mammary carcinomas with high clinical aggressiveness, and are considered relevant animal models for human breast cancer. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic pro-survival protein, whose expression is associated with a favorable outcome in human breast cancer. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of Bcl-2 expression in feline invasive mammary carcinomas (FMCs), its relationship with other clinicopathologic variables, and its prognostic value. This retrospective study included 180 FMCs, diagnosed in female cats treated by surgery only, with a 2-year follow-up post-mastectomy. Bcl-2, ER, PR, Ki-67, HER2, and CK5/6 expression were determined by automated immunohistochemistry. A receiver-operating-characteristic curve was used to set the threshold for Bcl-2 positivity. Results: The cohort comprises 32% (57/180) luminal FMCs defined by ER and/or PR positivity, and 68% (123/180) triple-negative FMCs (negative for ER, PR, and HER2). Bcl-2 expression was considered as positive when at least 65% of tumor cells were immunohistochemically stained. Thirty-one out of 180 FMCs (17%) were Bcl-2-positive. There was no significant association between Bcl-2 expression, and the tumor size, nodal stage, histological grade, or ER, PR, Ki-67, HER2, and CK5/6 expression. By multivariate survival analysis (Cox proportional-hazards regression), Bcl-2 positivity in FMCs was associated with longer disease-free interval (p = 0.005, HR = 0.38), overall survival (p = 0.028, HR = 0.61), and cancer-specific survival (p = 0.019, HR = 0.54) independently of other powerful prognostic factors such as pathologic tumor size, pathologic nodal stage, and distant metastasis. The positive prognostic value of Bcl-2 was confirmed in both luminal FMCs, of which 9/57 (16%) were Bcl-2-positive, and in basal-like triple-negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-, CK5/6+) FMCs, of which 14/76 (18%) were Bcl-2-positive. Conclusions: Compared to human breast cancer, Bcl-2 positivity in feline invasive mammary carcinomas is also associated with better outcome, but is less common, and not associated with ER, PR, and HER2 expression. Cats with spontaneous Bcl-2-positive FMCs could be useful in preclinical trials evaluating anti-Bcl-2 strategies for chemoresistant luminal or triple-negative breast cancers. © 2019 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Kidney-type glutaminase (GLS), the first enzyme in the glutaminolysis pathway, catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. GLS was found to be upregulated in many glutamine-dependent cancer cells. Therefore, selective inhibition of GLS has gained substantial interest as a therapeutic approach targeting cancer metabolism. Bis-2-[5-(phenylacetamido)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]ethyl sulfide (BPTES), despite its poor physicochemical properties, has served as a key molecular template in subsequent efforts to identify more potent and drug-like allosteric GLS inhibitors. This review article provides an overview of the progress made to date in the development of GLS inhibitors and highlights the remarkable transformation of the unfavorable lead into \"druglike\" compounds guided by systematic SAR studies. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "A novel class of bivalent ligands targeting putative protease-activated receptor (PAR) heteromers has been prepared based upon reported antagonists for the subtypes PAR1 and PAR2. Modified versions of the PAR1 antagonist RWJ-58259 containing alkyne adapters were connected via cycloaddition reactions to azide-capped polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacers attached to imidazopyridazine-based PAR2 antagonists. Initial studies of the PAR1-PAR2 antagonists indicated that they inhibited G alpha q-mediated calcium mobilization in endothelial and cancer cells driven by both PAR1 and PAR2 agonists. Compounds of this novel class hold promise for the prevention of restenosis, cancer cell metastasis, and other proliferative disorders. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Molecular chaperones HSP90 and HSP70 are essential regulators of the folding and activation of a disparate ensemble of client proteins. They function through ATP hydrolysis and the assembly of multiprotein complexes with cochaperones and clients. While their therapeutic relevance is recognized, important details underlying the links between ATP-dependent conformational dynamics and clients/cochaperones recruitment remain elusive. Allosteric modulators represent fundamental tools to obtain molecular insights into functional regulation. By selective perturbation of different aspects of HSP90/HSP70 activities, allosteric drugs can tune rather than completely inhibit signaling cascades, providing information on the relationships between structure-dynamics and function. Herein, we review advances in the design of HSP90 and HSP70 allosteric modulators. We consider inhibitors and activators in different biochemical and disease models. We discuss these compounds as probes to decipher the complexity of the chaperone machinery and that at the same time represent starting leads for the development of drugs against cancer and neurodegeneration. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Among all of the epigenetic events that are responsible for various diseases such as cancer, lupus, and several birth defects, DNA methylation is one of the crucial ones. It occurs because of the alkylation of various bases. These modifications of genes carried through altered creations of proteins ultimately lead to various diseases. For example, a vital cause behind canine lymphoma is found to be DNA methylation in the guanine base. In this work, we analyzed the methylated and nonmethylated guanine structure with the assistance of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Because of their vulnerability for causing DNA methylation, the N7 and O6 positions of the guanine structure were the positions of interest with the addition of various adducts such as methyl, hydroxyethyl, and deuterated methyl groups. To distinguish the methylated samples from the nonmethylated ones, principal component analysis was performed, and the same analysis was used to distinguish their methylated positions and added adducts. The experimental results were then explained by structure optimization and frequency calculation of the molecules based on DFT calculations. To understand the charge distribution and detect the possible locations of alkylation of DNA bases, electrostatic potential, highest occupied molecular orbital, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for each of the molecules were analyzed, and the reactivity was discussed in the light of electronic structure calculations. The results presented in this study demonstrate a potential label-free technique to examine epigenetic modification of DNA. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The biggest problem with the occurrence of breast cancer is late diagnosis, which is associated with high mortality rates. The aim of the study was to appraise the number of circulating endothelial precursors and the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and the soluble forms of its receptors, sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2, in breast cancer patients with respect to clinicopathological features. Material and methods: The study involved 85 women of Caucasian ethnicity aged 45–66 with primary breast cancer without distant metastases (M0). Inclusion criteria were as follows: histopathological examination confirming the diagnosis of primary breast cancer, without previous radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry evaluation of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, Ki67 expression was made in all cases. In the EDTA-plasma, the concentrations of VEGF-A and its soluble receptors, sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2, were measured applying immunoassay techniques. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were identified with the immune-phenotype CD45 − , CD34 + , CD133 + , CD31 + using flow cytometry. Results: Older women with breast cancer had significantly higher concentrations of VEGF-A as well as sVEGFR2 compared with their younger counterparts. A significantly higher concentration of the soluble form of VEGF receptor type 1 in patients with T1 breast cancer in relation to T2 cases was noted. Also, negative correlations between circulating EPCs and histological grading as well as a soluble form of VEGFR2 with histological grading of breast cancer according to the Elston-Ellis classification were observed. Conclusions: Anti-angiogenic potential is divergent in relation to the clinicopathological determinants. © 2019 Medical University of Bialystok",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Cerebral metastases develop in 10–30% of patients with breast cancer (BC) and in around 3.3 to 4% of patients with ovarian cancer (OC). The aim of the multicenter study is to investigate the correlation between the expression of estrogen alpha receptors (ERα), progesterone receptors (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1), astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG1), depending on the status of BRCA1 protein, in patients suffering from OC and BC with brain metastases. Patients and methods: The analysis included 51 patients: 29 with BC and 22 with OC, in whom brain metastases were disclosed. Results: In most patients (65.5% of BC patients and 68.2% of patients with OC tumors) BRCA1 protein loss was found. No correlation was disclosed between the levels of ERα, PR receptors, HER2, SDF1, CXCR4, AEG1, BRMS1 and BRCA1 status, patient age, stage of disease advancement, grade of histological maturity of the cells, presence of metastases to lymph nodes. A statistically significant correlation was disclosed between the negative expression of PR receptors and a high expression of CXCR4 in patients with BC. High values of the AEG1 protein (linked to metastases) were detected alongside a high expression of BRMS1 (a suppressor of metastases). Conclusions: Patients with BC and OC and brain metastases have a frequent loss of BRCA1 expression. The role of ERα, PR, HER2, SDF1, CXCR4, AEG1, BRMS1 in metastatic process needs further studies. © 2019 Medical University of Bialystok",

    "Abstract": "Background: The relevance of studies focusing on patient satisfaction becomes imperative for patients with cancer, who often face major changes in their lifestyles. Their perceived uncertainty in illness and their personal experiences with the services received are crucial factors for a qualitatively adequate assistance. Objectives: To assess the determinants of patient satisfaction, using a sample of 306 Bulgarian oncology outpatients. Methods: The hypotheses tested concern the extent to which patient satisfaction depends on the uncertainty in illness; the patients’ assessment of technical and interpersonal skills of nurses and medical staff; the information provision; and some organizational aspects. Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire composed of internationally validated scales assessing the determinants of patient satisfaction (measured through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer), uncertainty in illness (assessed through the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale), and patients’ health status (assessed through the EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire and the visual analogue scale). An ordered logit model was run, using the level of overall patient satisfaction as a dependent variable. Results: This is one of the first studies carried out in Bulgaria for oncology patient satisfaction of subjective factors related to the frailty of the oncology patient status such as age, self-assessed health-related quality of life, and uncertainty in illness. Nevertheless, other determinants, reflecting the quality of the care provided, also have an impact on patient satisfaction, namely, the assessment of the nonmedical personnel, the perception of medical technical skills, and the access to a medical center. Conclusions: Results stress the relevance of reducing uncertainty in illness in patients with cancer by implementing a satisfactory patient-physician relationship in the management of the disease. © 2018 ISPOR–The professional society for health economics and outcomes research",

    "Abstract": "We report a methodology to encapsulate gold nanorods (AuNRs) and gold bipyramids (AuBPs) into polyelectrolyte capsules for catalytic application. Microreactors (capsules with encapsulated NRs or BPs) were fabricated by sequential deposition of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) and dextran sulfate on modified sacrificial template, followed by core dissolution. AuNRs and AuBPs of size 25-30 nm were successfully encapsulated in the fabricated polyelectrolyte capsules and were stable and distributed uniformly in the interior. Fabricated microreactors were investigated as catalysts for the reduction of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol in the presence of sodium borohydride in aqueous phase. Reaction parameters such as order, conversion, and rate constants were estimated for microreactors and compared to free anisotropic nanoparticles in suspension. The reaction rate was higher for NRs in both free and capsule forms compared to BPs. Microreactors demonstrated excellent catalytic activity even after three times of use. Such capsules have high potential for use as microreactors in applications such as catalysis, drug delivery, imaging, and cancer chemo-photothermal therapy. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "A 72-year-old female status post renal transplant presenting with right hemiparesis, expressive aphasia, and weight loss was found to have a left frontal ring-enhancing lesion with associated vasogenic edema. Imaging was most concerning for high-grade glioma, gliomatosis cerebri with anaplastic transformation, vs solitary metastasis and less concerning for evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage, abscess, tuberculoma, or fungal granuloma. Maximal safe resection was not feasible. Awaiting stereotactic biopsy results, plans for palliative chemoradiotherapy for presumed glioblastoma were initiated. Frozen pathology review suggested high-grade glioma but ultimate diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis was made. Patient started sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, and leucovorin. This case identifies an uncommon presentation of cerebral toxoplasmosis whose definitive pathological diagnosis was indispensable to preservation of life. It serves as a critical example of the importance of maintaining a wide differential, as a patient with presumed aggressive terminal cancer was diagnosed with a treatable parasitic infection. We share perspectives from neurosurgery, medical-oncology, radiation-oncology, and infectious disease specialists regarding diagnosis and management. We highlight atypical presentations of cerebral toxoplasmosis, emphasize differential diagnoses, and promote obtaining tissue diagnosis in guiding medical decision making of ring enhancing lesions. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Recently, deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success by integrating deep learning models into reinforcement learning algorithms in various applications such as computer games and robots. Specially, it is promising for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment to combine deep reinforcement learning with medical big data generated and collected from medical Internet of Things. In this paper, we focus on the potential of the deep reinforcement learning for lung cancer detection as many people are suffering from the lung tumor and about 1.8 million patients died from lung cancer in 2018. Early detection and diagnosis of lung tumor can significantly improve the treatment effect and prolong survival. In this work, we present several representative deep reinforcement learning models that are potential to use for lung cancer detection. Furthermore, we summarize the common types of lung cancer and the main characteristics of each type. Finally, we point out the open challenges and possible future research directions of applying deep reinforcement learning to lung cancer detection, which is expected to promote the evolution of smart medicine with medical Internet of Things. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Regional anesthesia may mitigate the risk of persistent postoperative pain (PPP). This Cochrane review, published originally in 2012, was updated in 2017. Methods: We updated our search of Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL to December 2017. Only RCTs investigating local anesthetics (by any route) or regional anesthesia versus any combination of systemic (opioid or non-opioid) analgesia in adults or children, reporting any pain outcomes beyond three months were included. Data were extracted independently by at least two authors, who also appraised methodological quality with Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ assessment and pooled data in surgical subgroups. We pooled studies across different follow-up intervals. As summary statistic, we reported the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals and calculated the number needed to benefit (NNTB). We considered classical, Bayesian alternatives to our evidence synthesis. We explored heterogeneity and methodological bias. Results: 40 new and seven ongoing studies, identified in this update, brought the total included RCTs to 63. We were only able to synthesize data from 39 studies enrolling 3027 participants in a balanced design. Evidence synthesis favored regional anesthesia for thoracotomy (OR 0.52 [0.32 to 0.84], moderate-quality evidence), breast cancer surgery (OR 0.43 [0.28 to 0.68], low-quality evidence), and cesarean section (OR 0.46, [0.28 to 0.78], moderate-quality evidence). Evidence synthesis favored continuous infusion of local anesthetic after breast cancer surgery (OR 0.24 [0.08 to 0.69], moderate-quality evidence), but was inconclusive after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (OR 0.20, [0.04 to 1.09], low-quality evidence). Conclusions: Regional anesthesia reduces the risk of PPP. Small study size, performance, null, and attrition bias considerably weakened our conclusions. We cannot extrapolate to other interventions or to children. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A cryocooler-cooled high-temperature superconducting magnet was constructed, and it was tested on the beam line of the heavy ion medial accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). The magnet consists of a pair of four-stacked racetrack coils wound with RE-123 coated conductor that are plated with 41-μm copper for protection. The magnet has a room temperature beam duct, at which 2.4 T of magnetic field is generated, whereas the maximum magnetic field to which coated conductors are exposed is approximately 4 T. The magnetic field in the beam duct was measured and calculated to examine its stability, which might have been affected by shielding currents in the coated conductors. On the beam line of the HIMAC, at first, the beam guiding by the magnet was demonstrated. The measured beam-guiding characteristics were compared with the beam tracking calculations. Next, a carbon ion beam was injected intentionally into the RE-123 coils of the magnet to simulate the incidents of uncontrolled beam injection into accelerator magnets. Prior to this test, the possible heat deposition to the coil by the beam injection was calculated, and the feasibility of quench protection using a dump resistor was studied through quench experiments using short pieces of the RE-123 coated conductors. © 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "AID/APOBEC3 enzymes are cytidine deaminases that mutate antibody and retroviral genes and also mediate extensive tumor genome mutagenesis. The study of purified AID/APOBEC3 proteins is challenged by difficulties with their expression and purification arising from genotoxicity in expression hosts, extensive non-specific protein-protein/DNA/RNA interactions and haphazard oligomerization. To date, expression hosts for purification of AID/APOBEC3 enzymes include bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Here the establishment and optimization of a yeast expression/secretion system for AID/APOBEC3s are reported, followed by comparison with the same enzymes expressed in bacterial and mammalian hosts. AID and APOBEC3G were expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris, each either with an N-terminal GST tag, C-terminal V5-His tag or as untagged native form. It was verified that the yeast-expressed enzymes exhibit identical biochemical properties to those reported using bacterial and mammalian expression, indicating high fidelity of protein folding. It was demonstrated that the system can be adapted for secretion of the enzymes into the media which was used directly in various enzyme assays. The system is also amenable to elimination of bulky fusion tags, providing native untagged enzymes. Thus, P. pastoris is an advantageous expression factory for AID/APOBEC3 enzymes, considering the cost, time, efficiency and quality of the obtained enzymes. The first report is also provided here of a functionally active, untagged, secreted AID, which may become a useful research reagent. A comprehensive comparison is made of the effect of fusion tags and expression hosts on the biochemical actions of AID and APOBEC3G. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Periodical applications of immunotherapy and chemotherapy play significant roles in cancer treatment and studies have shown that the evolution of tumour cells is subject to random events. In order to capture the effects of such noise we developed a stochastic tumour-immune dynamical model with pulsed treatment to describe combinations of immunotherapy with chemotherapy. By using theorems of the impulsive stochastic dynamical equation, the tumour free solution and the global positive solution of the proposed system were investigated. We then show that the expectations of the solutions are bounded. Furthermore, threshold conditions for extinction, non-persistence in the mean, weak persistence and stochastic persistence of tumour cells are provided. The results reveal that comprehensive therapy or noise can dominate the evolution of tumours. Finally, biological implications are addressed and a conclusion is presented. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Chemical composition and bioactivity of eight edible Vitis vinifera L. leaf varieties originating from Fruška Gora, Serbia, including two autochthonous varieties, were evaluated. The LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of 28 natural products in leaf samples, among which most abundant were glycosylated flavonoids, ellagic and chlorogenic acids. The highest amounts of most of the tested compounds were detected in leaves of autochthonous variety Sila. Bioactivity was assessed by a set of in vitro antioxidant, neuroprotective and cytotoxic assays. Leaves of all examined varieties exhibited average bioactivity, with leaves of autochthonous variety Župljanka standing out as the most promising sample. To conclude, investigated grapevine leaves proved to be a rich source of nutraceuticals, primarily antioxidants, and their further employment as medicinal food in human diet and beneficial raw material for food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries should be supported. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: The X-ray screening is one of the most popular methodologies in detection of respiratory system diseases. Chest organs are screened on the film or digital file which go to the doctor for evaluation. However, the analysis of x-ray images requires much experience and time. Clinical decision support is very important for medical examinations. The use of Computational Intelligence can simulate the evaluation and decision processes of a medical expert. We propose a method to provide a decision support for the doctor in order to help to consult each case faster and more precisely. Methods: We use image descriptors based on the spatial distribution of Hue, Saturation and Brightness values in x-ray images, and a neural network co-working with heuristic algorithms (Moth-Flame, Ant Lion) to detect degenerated lung tissues in x-ray image. The neural network evaluates the image and if the possibility of a respiratory disease is detected, the heuristic method identifies the degenerated tissues in the x-ray image in detail based on the use of the proposed fitness function. Results: The average accuracy is 79.06% in pre-detection stage, similarly the sensitivity and the specificity averaged for three pre-classified diseases are 84.22% and 66.7%, respectively. The misclassification errors are 3.23% for false positives and 3.76% for false negatives. Conclusions: The proposed neuro-heuristic approach addresses small changes in the structure of lung tissues, which appear in pneumonia, sarcoidosis or cancer and some consequences that may appear after the treatment. The results show high potential of the newly proposed method. Additionally, the method is flexible and has low computational burden. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The Fenton reaction was discovered over 120 years ago, yet our understanding of the complete reaction mechanism of the seemingly simple iron and hydrogen peroxide reaction (Fe+H 2 O 2 ) remains unclear, thus limiting its full potential. In this work, the aim is to summarize the processes that pertain to the (photo) Fenton reaction. More specifically, this review does not consider previous work relating to the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP)-mediated disinfection/decontamination of stream flows, as much work has successfully achieved this. Instead, this manuscript presents an overview of the other fields of environmental and medical applications of (photo)Fenton: i) surface pre-treatment (nano-particles functionalization or modification), ii) terrestrial and algal biomass (pre)treatment to enhance high value products’ recovery, iii) cancer treatment (malignant tumor elimination) and iv) other medical uses (antibiotics development, wounds disinfection, root canal sterilization and teeth whitening). For each field of application, the focus lies on analyzing the conceptualization and framework of the (photo) Fenton process, the opportunities and limitations, as well as a series of related applications. To conclude, the work discusses the current limitations of the existing applications and future research avenues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer is the second leading cause of human death. Therefore, comprehensive research and the appropriate tools are needed in this field. Animal models and cell culture studies are the most important preclinical tools in cancer research. In 2D cell culture models, cells are forced to grow in a 2D environment, which differs from their natural physiology. Recently, 3D cell culture models were developed to fill the gap between 2D cell culture and animal models. Materials and methods: Human amniotic membranes were obtained, decellularized, characterized and used as a natural 3D scaffold to investigate cancer cell behavior in 2D compared to 3D conditions. Time-lapse imaging of cells was used, and cell proliferation, velocity and migration were evaluated. Cisplatin was applied in 2D and 3D conditions, followed by evaluation of viability, apoptosis and cancer stem cell proteins by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Results: The results showed that in the decellularized amnion membrane (DAM) scaffold most cells did not spread and remain rounded and then penetrated into the scaffold with no cytotoxicity. Significant differences in migration, velocity, morphology and proliferation of cancer cells were observed between the 3D DAM scaffold and 2D model. Furthermore, the cells in the 3D DAM scaffold showed much more resistance to apoptosis and higher CSC content. Conclusion: In conclusion, considering the effect of the 3D DAM scaffold in cell behavior, apoptosis resistance and CSC content as well as the short processing time for decellularizing the AM, it appears that the 3D DAM scaffold offers an appropriate tool for in vitro cancer research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80–85% of all lung cancer which is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Eighty percent of NSCLC patients exhibit high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. In recent years, Doxorubicin (Dox, a widely used chemotherapeutic drug) and/or Cetuximab (Cet, an EGFR-targeted inhibitor) combined with nanoparticles for cancer therapy have attracted significant attention due to their efficient targeting and the resulting increased cytotoxicity on tumor cells. Herein, we report the effects of Dox and Cet, co-conjugated to dextran-coated Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (Dox-NPs-Cet) on the NSCLC cell line A549, which expresses a high level of EGFR. Cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and intercellular uptake were investigated after treatment with this conjugate. The results indicate that Dox-NPs-Cet significantly suppress cell proliferation of A549 cells as compared with A549 cells treated with NPs only conjugated with Dox. In summary, our study demonstrates that Dox-NPs-Cet could serve as a promising candidate for targeted therapy of NSCLC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop paclitaxel (PTX) formulations with solid dispersion (SD) and micelles (M) in order to improve solubility and oral absorption in rats. In addition, the enhanced anti-cancer effects of PTX formulations were compared in various breast cancer cell lines. The SD formulations with various copolymers were prepared using a solvent evaporation method, and micelles with Soluplus® mixed with D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000-succinate (TPGS) were prepared using a film hydration method. The physical properties of SD and M formulations were evaluated. The dissolution (%) of SD4 and SD9 formulations, and the solubility of M2 were significantly higher than those of PTX. The SD formulations and micelles were also stable for 3 and 1 month, respectively. The anti-cancer effects of SD4, SD9, and M2 significantly increased in breast cancer cells, whereas the blank formulations were not toxic to normal cells. The SD4, SD9 and M formulations improved the permeability of Cou-6 compared to Cou-6 solution in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK line). The SD formulations and micelles had enhanced bioavailability (BA) compared to that of PTX, showing relative BA values of 667.3% (SD4), 359.6% (SD9), and 365.4% (M2). This study demonstrates the technologies to increase the anti-cancer effects and BA of PTX, via SD and micelle formulations, and, to our knowledge, is the first comparison of the two formulations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Among the different types of polymeric vehicles, (PLGA) is biodegradable and has emerged as promising tool for the delivery of cancer therapeutics. The salient features of PLGA micro carriers include prolonged circulation time, increased tumor localization and biodegradability and effectiveness of the therapeutics. We have synthesized PLGA microspheres where curcumin can be loaded and thereby increases its bioavailability. The cytotoxicity of curcumin (PLGA@CCM) microspheres was evaluated on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. They were found to induce apoptosis by perturbing the mitochondrial membrane potential. PLGA@CCM@FA induces apoptosis in human triple negative breast cancer cells by up-regulating Cleaved caspase-3 and down regutes p-AKT. The in-vivo study in BALB/C mice model exhibited more tumor regression in case of PLGA@CCM@FA microspheres. Our results suggests that these microspheres can be an effective vehicle for delivery of hydrophobic drugs to the folate over expressed cancer cells.",

    "Abstract": "Multiplex electrochemical sensors for amperometric detection of glutathione disulfide (GSSG), glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys), cystine (Cyss), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP + ) and coenzyme II reduced tetrasodium salt (NADPH) were developed, in which analysis of Cyss, NADP + and NADPH are the first report using this sensing system. Specificity of these sensors were ensured by a layer of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) which was electropolymerized in situ with the analytes as template. All the sensors were tested with standard buffers and mouse blood samples, showing satisfactory performance towards the corresponding analytes. Dynamic concentration for the six analytes was in the range of 10 −11 –10 −8 mol/L with the detection limit down to 20 pmol/L. In addition, artificially synthesized MIP film on the electrodes allowed for good selectivity and stability. Real blood sample measurement proved that the sensors owned decent accuracy with recovery value ranging from 92%~112%. More importantly, blood samples from lung cancer patients and healthy donors were assayed by using the proposed sensors. Redox potentials (Ehc) were calculated based on the contents of these endogenic substances, which were utilized to reflect the health status of human body and help diagnose lung cancer. The levels of GSH, NADPH and the absolute value of Ehc (GSH/GSSG) in patients with lung cancer are significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01) than those in healthy people, while the contents of GSSG (P &lt; 0.01) are higher. The blood test results suggested that the content of GSH, NADPH, NADP + and Ehc (GSH/GSSG) might serve as biomarkers for lung cancer prediagnosis. These novel sensors for liquid biospy of cancer have cost–benefit and scalability advantage over current techniques, potentially enabling broader clinical access and efficient population screening. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Naturally occurring bioactive compounds are gaining much importance as anti-tumor agents in recent times due to their high therapeutic potential and less systemic toxicity. However, different preclinical and clinical studies have noted significant shortcomings, such as nonspecific tumor targeting and low bioavailability which limit their usage in therapeutics. Therefore, a safe and compatible nanoparticle mediated controlled drug delivery system is in high demand to enable effective transport of the drug candidates in the tumor tissue. Herein, we have synthesized phenylboronic acid (PBA) conjugated Zinc oxide nanoparticles (PBA-ZnO), loaded with quercetin (a bioflavonoid widely found in plants), with zeta potential around −10.2 mV and diameter below 40 nm. Presence of PBA moieties over the nanoparticle surface facilitates targeted delivery of quercetin to the sialic acid over-expressed cancer cells. Moreover, Quercetin loaded PBA-ZnO nanoparticles (denoted as PBA-ZnO-Q) showed pH responsive drug release behavior. Results suggested that PBA-ZnO-Q induced apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) via enhanced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. In line with the in vitro results, PBA-ZnO-Q was found to be effective in reducing tumor growth in EAC tumor bearing mice. Most interestingly, PBA-ZnO-Q is found to reduce tumor associated toxicity in liver, kidney and spleen. The cytotoxic potential of the nanohybrid is attributed to the combinatorial cytotoxic effects of quercetin and ZnO in the cancer cells. Overall, the presented data highlighted the chemotherapeutic potential of the novel nanohybrid, PBA-ZnO-Q which can be considered for clinical cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is a rapidly advancing field that may improve outcomes in several cancer types. Although screening has decreased colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, it remains a common and often fatal malignancy. In this study, we sought to identify an optical imaging agent for the application of FGS technology to CRC. Methods: We compared a panitumumab-IRDye800CW conjugate to an IgG-IRDye800CW isotype control. Mice were implanted with one of three CRC cell lines (LS174T, Colo205, and SW948) and imaged with open- and closed-filed fluorescence imaging systems. Fluorescent contrast was quantified by calculating the ratio between tumor and background fluorescence. After 10 d, the mice were sacrificed, and their tumors stained for microscopic imaging. Results: Panitumumab-IRDye800CW produced significantly greater (P < 0.05) fluorescent contrast in all three cell lines. Average tumor to background ratio was 6.00 versus 2.60 for LS174T, 5.78 versus 2.52 for Colo205, and 4.31 versus 1.70 for SW948. A 1-mg tumor fragment produced significantly greater fluorescent contrast in the Colo205 and SW948 cell lines in the panitumumab-IRDye800CW group. Western blotting for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a semiquantitative analysis of EGFR expression noted strong expression in all three cell lines; however, EGFR expression did not directly correlate to tumor to background ratio. Conclusions: Panitumumab-IRDye800CW produces significantly greater fluorescent contrast than IgG-IRDye800CW in a murine model of CRC and is a suitable agent for the application of FGS technology to CRC. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The fluorescence labeling of aptamers is a useful technology for aptamer tracking and imaging on the cells. The aptamer SL₂-B, against the heparin binding domain (HBD) of VEGF165 protein, was linked to QDs, producing the QD-SL₂-B aptamer conjugate. The QDs and the QD-aptamer conjugate were characterized and photobleaching effect was studied prior to the cellular incubation. Fluorescence imaging showed that the QD-SL₂-B aptamer conjugate could specifically recognize Hep G2 liver cancer cells and is taken up by the cells without addition of any external transfecting or cell permeabilizing agent. In addition, the results also indicate that incubation time is important for the aptamer cellular uptake and to exhibit its antiproliferative activity on Hep G2 liver cancer cells. This QDs labeling technique provides a new strategy for labeling aptamer molecules for aptamer detection, imaging and understanding their cellular uptake.",

    "Abstract": "Due to the advantage of achieving a better performance under weak regularization, elastic net has attracted wide attention in statistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and other fields. In particular, a variation of the elastic net, adaptive elastic net (AEN), integrates the adaptive grouping effect. In this paper, we aim to develop a new algorithm: Adaptive Elastic Net with Conditional Mutual Information (AEN-CMI) that further improves AEN by incorporating conditional mutual information into the gene selection process. We apply this new algorithm to screen significant genes for two kinds of cancers: colon cancer and leukemia. Compared with other algorithms including Support Vector Machine, Classic Elastic Net, Adaptive Lasso and Adaptive Elastic Net, the proposed algorithm, AEN-CMI, obtains the best classification performance using the least number of genes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Poorly differentiated GC predicts a poor prognosis and is related to patients’ response to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Therefore, it is very important to accurately evaluate the tumour differentiation status for the treatment of poorly differentiated GC. To develop a molecular probe to analyse poorly differentiated GC, we selected aptamers against poorly differentiated GC by subtractive Cell-SELEX using the poorly differentiated GC cell line BGC-823 as the target and the moderately differentiated GC cell line SGC-7901 as the negative control. After 15 rounds of selection, aptamer PDGC21 exhibited the highest affinity, and the K d value of the truncated aptamer PDGC21-T was 35.2 ± 1.1 nM. Aptamer PDGC21-T not only specifically bound to the target cells but also bound to other poorly differentiated GC cells. When combined with fluorescent nanoparticle quantum dots (QDs), the PDGC21-T-QD probe could distinguish poorly differentiated GC cells in mixed culture cells and clinical specimens. Furthermore, in a tissue microarray containing 15 cases from patients, there was a higher positive rate in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues; in poorly differentiated tissues, in particular, the fluorescence signal was significantly higher than that in well/moderately differentiated tissues. Therefore, aptamer PDGC21-T holds great potential for use as a molecular imaging probe for the detection of poorly differentiated GC, which is of great significance for diagnosis and treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of D3 lymph node (TSLN) for the survival of patients with colorectal cancer. Methods: A total of 156 patients with R0 resected colorectal cancer were selected from 2011 to 2015 to carry out a retrospective study. The survival rate according to the groups of positive lymph node number (N: 1-3, N2: 4-6, N3: ≥7) and TSLN (TSLN [-], TSLN [+]) was analyzed. The influences of covariates on the 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) were determined by the Cox proportional risk model of backward stepwise analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to draw survival curves between and within groups. Results: During the median follow-up period (44.0 months), the 5-year DFS rate and OS rate were 45.0% and 46.0%, respectively. Survival analysis of the TSLN group showed that the 5-year OS rate and 5-year DFS rate in the TSLN (+) group (20.0 and 16.2%, respectively) were significantly lower than those in the TSLN (-) group (68.3 and 51.6%, respectively) (P < 0.001). The 5-year OS rate and DFS rate of the TSLN (+) and TSLN (-) subgroups in the N1 group were 16.7%, 33.3%, 56.7%, and 55.7%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that positive lymph node, TSLN, and Pathological T stage were independent prognostic factors of DFS and OS for 5 years. Patients in the TSLN (+) group had a poorer prognosis. Conclusions: TSLN metastasis is an independent factor influencing the prognosis of patients, and patients with TSLN (+) have a poor prognosis. As an independent prognostic factor, this factor should be considered when evaluating the prognosis of patients. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "As a universal tumor biomarker, research on the activity and inhibition of telomerase is of great importance for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we demonstrate the conformational switch-based fluorescence detection of telomerase activity using a redesigned RNA aptamer Spinach. Briefly, the original Spinach aptamer was extended at its 5′ end and folded into an inactive conformation, where association with the small molecule fluorophore, 5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI) was prevented. Only in the presence of telomerase, (TTAGGG) n repeats were added to the 3′ end of the telomerase substrate primer, and the elongation products hybridized with inactive Spinach molecules, triggering its conformational switch and refolding it into the active, DFHBI-binding conformation. Moreover, the fluorescence signal was further amplified through a target recycling circuit, where Ribonuclease H (RNase H) specifically hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bonds of RNA in the DNA-RNA hybrid. The released telomere products could then hybridize to new inactive Spinach molecules and initiate multiple amplification cycles. The proposed fluorescent biosensor presented great performance for telomerase activity detection from 100 to 5 × 10 4 Hela cells with a detection limit of 100 cells. Besides, this new assay offers a good biosensing platform for differentiation of cancer cell lines from normal cell line and evaluation the inhibition efficiency of telomere-binding ligand, which is of great importance for telomerase-related cancer diagnosis and therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) has been recognized as an important biomarker for the early diagnosis and management of breast cancer. However, there is still challenge in the clinical detection of HER2. In this work, a simple strategy for “turn on” fluorescent detection of HER2 with ultra-sensitivity and high specificity was developed. Herein, HER2-binding aptamer (HApt) and DNA2 containing G-rich sequences, templated sequences for Ag nanoclusters (AgNCs), and complementary bases at both ends were involved to achieve the double stranded DNA templated AgNCs (dsDNA-AgNCs) as a fluorescence probe for HER2 detection. In the presence of HER2, the highly specific binding of HER2 to HApt caused HApt separating from dsDNA-AgNCs, resulting in the folding of DNA2-AgNCs because of the complementary bases at both ends, which led to AgNCs’ proximity to G-rich sequences, and therefore the enhanced fluorescence intensity. By monitoring the change in fluorescence signal (ΔF), HER2 was measured, and a linear range from 8.5 fM to 225 fM with a limit of detection (LOD) 0.0904 fM was obtained. More significantly, the detection of HER2 in serum samples was achieved with high accuracy, and the breast cancer patients were successfully discriminated from healthy persons. In summary, this strategy is simple, time-saving, cost-effective, ultrasensitive, specific, universal and more applicable for the detection of HER2. Therefore, we expect this present aptasensor can be used in the clinical detection of biomakers, which lays a potential foundation for the early diagnosis of cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentrations remains one of the leading methods for diagnosing prostate cancer. We developed and evaluated an immunoglobulin Y (IgY)-based ELISA to measure total PSA (tPSA) concentrations in human serum that could be used as an alternative to commercially available in vitro diagnostic assays that rely on mouse monoclonal IgG. METHODS: A sandwich ELISA based on an anti-PSA IgY antibody was developed. We evaluated the ability of the anti-PSA IgY antibody to detect free and complexed PSA at the same molar ratio. The assay was optimized, and its analytical performance was verified by calculating limit of background (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ). We performed correlation and regression analyses between tPSA concentrations measured by our ELISA and those from commercial assays: Cobas 6000 (Roche Diagnostics, Warszawa, Poland) and PSA total ELISA (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). RESULTS: LoB, LoD, and LoQ, were 0.061, 0.083, and 0.100 ng/mL, respectively, and linearity range was 0.100-3.375 ng/mL. tPSA concentrations from our IgY-based ELISA strongly correlated with those from the commercial assays. CONCLUSIONS: Our IgY-based ELISA is an efficient equivalent to the above commercial assays. The use of IgY as the detecting agent could reduce the risk of false positive results, as well as decrease the overall cost of analysis. © The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.",

    "Abstract": "Mouse melanoma B16-BL6 cells are useful cells for cancer metastatic studies. To understand the metastatic principle at molecular levels, it is necessary to carry out experiments in which cancer cells and their normal counterparts are compared. However, unlike normal human melanocytes, preparation of normal mouse melanocytes is quite difficult due to the lack of marketing and insufficient information on an established protocol for primary culture of mouse melanocytes. In this study, we aimed to establish a convenient method for primary culture of mouse melanocytes on the basis of the protocol for human melanocytes. The main obstacles to preparing pure mouse melanocytes are how to digest mouse skin tissue and how to reduce the contamination of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The obstacles were overcome by collagenase digestion for skin specimens, short time trypsinization for separating melanocytes and keratinocytes, and use of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and cholera toxin in the culture medium. These supplements act to prevent the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. The convenient procedure enabled us to prepare a pure culture of normal mouse melanocytes. Using enriched normal mouse melanocytes and cancerous B16-BL6 cells, we compared the expression levels of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), an important membrane protein for melanoma metastasis, in the cells. The results showed markedly higher expression of MCAM in B16-BL6 cells than in normal mouse melanocytes. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "The majority of eukaryotic regulated protein turnover is performed by the proteasome, a multi-catalytic enzyme. Due to the fact that proteasome enzyme abnormal functioning was observed in different malignant cells, the proteasome is becoming a target for medical treatment. In order to evaluate the mechanisms of action of pharmaceutical compounds on proteasome enzyme inhibition, detecting and characterizing its activity is essential. An electrochemical assay that allows the monitoring of the chymotrypsin-like activity and inhibition of the 20S proteasome enzyme, based on the electrochemical detection of an electroactive compound released upon proteolysis of an adequate chymotrypsin-substrate is described. By employing differential pulse voltammetric measurement, the activity of the 20S proteasome enzyme was investigated for different incubation times of 20S with oligopeptide substrate as well as for different concentrations of substrate. Enzyme kinetic parameters were determined by voltammetry and the electrochemical assay compared with fluorescence spectroscopy. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and atomic force microscopy were also used to investigate substrate interaction with the 20S proteasome and their adsorption at the electrode surface. Finally, the new electrochemical assay allowed to investigate the mechanisms of two different proteasome inhibitor drugs, bortezomib and oprozomib, underlying the applicability of the assay for understanding proteasome inhibitor action. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends of surgical treatments among young patients in T 1 N 0-1 M 0 stage based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Materials and methods: Patients aged less than 40 y diagnosed between 1998 and 2015 were enrolled, with tumors in T 1 N 0-1 M 0 stage and not located in the central area. Differences in clinical-pathological characteristics were evaluated using chi-square tests. Multivariate logistic regression was used to measure the various factors associated with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). Independent prognostic factors were evaluated by Cox model. Results: The total rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was 51.6%, which declined from 64.5% in 1998 to 39.6% in 2015. The total rate of CPM was 22.7%, which increased from 3.7% in 1998 to 38.7% in 2014 despite a decline to 32.7% in 2015. Meanwhile, the rate of reconstruction increased in line with that of CPM, from 9.4% in 1998 to 35.0% in 2015. There was a trend of increasing use of implant-based reconstruction. Significant higher odds of CPM were found in recent year of diagnosis between 2010 and 2015 and in implant-based reconstruction. Patients undergoing CPM had similar survival outcomes compared with those undergoing BCS and unilateral mastectomy, whereas those undergoing BCS had better survival outcomes compared with those undergoing unilateral mastectomy. Conclusions: A trend of growing preference for CPM and reconstruction was observed among young patients in early stage in recent years without survival benefits. Efforts should be made to promote efficient communication and evidence-based decision-making. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Differences in clinical staging and survival among pancreatic head, body, and tail cancers are not well defined. We aim to identify the prognostic relevance of primary tumor location in patients undergoing treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Materials and methods: The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with PDAC from 1998 to 2011 (n = 175,556). Patients were categorized by primary tumor site into head (67.5%, n = 118,343), body (15.5%, n = 27,218), and tail (17.0%, n = 29,885) groups. Univariate and Cox regression analyses were used to determine covariates associated with overall survival (OS). Results: Patients with head PDAC presented with earlier stage disease (39.2% Stage I/II versus 19.7% versus 16.0%, P < 0.001) and underwent resection more often (27.9% versus 10.7% versus 17.0%, P < 0.001) than those with body or tail tumors. Of surgically resected PDAC, those localized to the head had advanced pathologic stage (84.8% stage II/III versus 66.6% versus 65.6%, P < 0.001), higher nodal positivity (64.9% versus 45.8% versus 45%, P < 0.001), and worse tumor grade (35.9% poorly differentiated versus 29.5% versus 27.8%, P < 0.001). Despite increased utilization of adjuvant therapies (54.4% versus 45.6% versus 42.0%, P < 0.001), patients with head PDAC had inferior OS compared with those with body and tail tumors (P < 0.001). Conclusions: When examining patients with PDAC undergoing resection, tumor localization to the head is associated with improved resectability because they present earlier. Of resected PDACs, however, those localized to the head have worse OS compared with body and tail tumors. This discrepancy may represent a combination of lead time and selection biases and biologic differences between tumor sites. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Detection and identification of bitter compounds draw great attention in pharmaceutical and food industry. Several well-known agonists of specific bitter taste receptors have been found to exhibit anti-cancer effects. For example, N-C=S-containing compounds, such as allyl-isothiocyanates, have shown cancer chemo-preventive effects. It is worth noting that human T2R38 receptor is specific for compounds containing N-C=S moiety. Here, a bioinspired cell-based bioelctronic tongue (BioET) is developed for the high-specificity isothiocyanate-induced bitter detection, utilizing human Caco-2 cells as a primary sensing element and interdigitated impedance sensor as a secondary transducer. As an intestinal carcinoma cell line, Caco-2 endogenously expresses human bitter receptor T2R38, and the activation of T2R38 induces the changes of cellular morphology which can be detected by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). After configuration and optimization of parameters including timing of compound administration and cell density, quantitative bitter evaluation models were built for two well-known bitter compounds, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and propylthiouracil (PROP). The bitter specific detection of this BioET is inhibited by probenecid and U-73122, and is not elicited by other taste modalities or bitter ligands that do not activate T2R38. Moreover, by combining different computational tools, we designed a ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) protocol to select ligands that are likely to activate T2R38 receptor. Three computationally predicted agonists of T2R38 were selected using the LBVS protocol, and the BioET presented response to the predicted agonists, validating the capability of the LBVS protocol. This study suggests this unique cell-based BioET paves a general and promising way to specifically detect N-C=S-containing compounds that can be used for pharmaceutical study and drug development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Two high-affinity DNA aptamers for lung tumor cells were applied as biospecific elements in bioluminescent assay of patient blood. The oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′ end of both aptamers carrying either biotin or Ca 2+ -regulated photoprotein obelin was used to form a sandwich-type analytical complex on the surfaces of magnetic streptavidin-activated microspherical particles. Clinical blood samples from cases of morphologically confirmed lung cancer and control samples were analyzed applying the developed assay. From the receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis, the chosen threshold value as clinical decision limit offers the sensitivity of 91.5% and the specificity of 75% (p &lt; 0.001). The area under ROC curve with the value of 0.901 distinguishes well between the two groups under investigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Small well-defined spherical gold nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple non-physical method based on a mixture of gold salt, tetraethylene oxide and water, free of any additional reducing chemical agent or physical method. The ratio of tetraethylene oxide to water was optimized to achieve a fast synthesis within 30 min. Transmission electron microscopy images showed well dispersed gold nanospheres with a size ranging from 10 to 15 nm. XPS was used to confirm the oxidation state of gold nanoparticles and the oxidation products from tetraethylene oxide after the reaction. This new protocol performed in sustainable and biocompatible conditions is complementary to the current methods used to synthesize gold nanospheres. In order to use these particles in biological samples, we correlated the atomic absorption with the colorimetric concentration of nanospheres in solution. After 24 h of incubation of cancer or neuronal cell lines with these nanoparticles, transmission electron microscopy images showed similar cellular uptake in both cell lines, especially in cytoplasmic vesicular structures.",

    "Abstract": "Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as MoS 2 and WS 2 , have recently emerged as nanomaterials with potential use in biomedicine. An attractive means to favor their interaction with biological media is the use of proper biomolecules as exfoliating/dispersing agents. Here, MoS 2 flakes were stabilized with different small functional biomolecules such as adenosine monophosphate (AMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) through the strong nucleotide−MoS 2 interaction of Lewis acid-base type, rather than just on the weak dispersive and hydrophobic forces commonly associated with the use of many surfactants. The impact of the nucleotide-stabilized MoS 2 flakes on the viability and cell proliferation, on the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and on the preosteoblast differentiation process (early stage) has been also evaluated, as well as the incorporation and intracellular localization of the nanomaterials by MC3T3-E1 and Saos-2 cells. The nucleotide-stabilized MoS 2 flakes were found to exhibit excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore, their incorporation did not affect the integrity of the cell plasma membrane, which makes them ideal candidates for delivering drug/gene directly into cells. The in vitro cell response of tumor cells to these nanomaterials differs from that of undifferentiated cells, which provides the basis for their potential use in cancer therapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticles have attracted considerable attention in the field of separation science, especially for filtration studies designed to evaluate membrane integrity, investigate membrane pore-size properties, and model membrane transport. A common reason for studying nanoparticle filtration is their potential to be used as surrogates for the various types of viruses in water treatment and bioprocessing applications. Although the effect of adding surfactants to stabilize nanoparticle suspension has been explored for a number of different applications, there is significant variation in the amounts and types of surfactants used in those studies. In this study, we used three different sizes (59, 188, and 490 nm) of spherical fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (PNPs) – the two smaller sizes were chosen to mimic the width and length of Rhabdovirus, a bullet-shaped enveloped virus that is currently being studied as bio-therapeutic for the treatment of cancer. The PNPs were suspended in solutions with varying concentrations of the nonionic surfactant Tween 20 (0.0005% to 0.1% (v/v) in carbonate buffer solution) and were tested in constant-flux filtration studies using two commercial microfiltration membranes (Durapore PVDF and MiniSart PES) with 0.22 µm pore size ratings. Our results clearly show that the transmission behavior of PNPs is critically dependent on the surfactant concentration in the buffer feed solution. The results could only be partially explained by interparticle interactions as we also observed major differences in the performances of the two microfiltration membranes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The human 6-O-endosulfatases HSulf-1 and -2 catalyze the region-selective hydrolysis of the 6-O-sulfate group of the glucosamine residues within sulfated domains of heparan sulfate, thereby ensuring a unique and original post-biosynthetic modification of the cell surface proteoglycans. While numerous studies point out the role of HSulf-2 in crucial physiological processes as well as in pathological conditions particularly in cancer, its structural organization in two chains and its functional properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we report the first characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) of HSulf-2. An average molecular weight of 133,115 Da was determined for the whole enzyme by MALDI-TOF MS, i.e. higher than the naked amino acid backbone (98,170 Da), highlighting a significant contribution of post-translational modifications. The HSulf-2 protein sequence was determined by Nano-LC-MS/MS, leading to 63% coverage and indicating at least four N-glycosylation sites at Asn 108, 147, 174 and 217. These results provide a platform for further structural investigations of the HSulf enzymes, aiming at deciphering the role of each chain in the substrate binding and specificities and in the catalytic activities. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Camptothecin, a pyrroloquinoline alkaloid, is one of the most promising anti-cancer drugs. Although this compound has been reported to exist in several species, the highest concentration (about 0.30%) has been reported from Nothapodytes nimmoniana. In this study, we described the dynamics of camptothecin and methoxy camptothecin accumulation during fruit development, seed germination and their role on seed pathogens and seed pests. HPLC analysis revealed camptothecin and methoxy camptothecin content high (0.28%) in stage-3 and decreased in the later stages. Whereas, in the different parts of the fruit, the maximum accumulation in the endosperm (0.46%) of stage-3 followed by the embryo, seed coat, and fruit coat. The pattern of accumulation of both the metabolites were decreasing at the time of seed hydration, early seed germination (0.12%–0.08%) and thereafter it is increasing up to 8-week seedlings (0.08%–0.39%). The growth inhibition of five seed-borne fungal pathogens and fecundity of pulse beetles on chickpea seeds were tested for different concentrations of camptothecin ranging from 0.01 to 10 μg ml −1 for the sensitivity. At 10 μg ml −1 concentration the fungal isolates were severely inhibited. The lowest number of eggs (106) laid was observed on 10 μg ml −1 concentration compared to the control (169). The results showed that camptothecin is found in plants have a role in defense against insect herbivores and pathogens involved in deterrence/antifeedant activity or toxic. © 2019 South African Association of Botanists",

    "Abstract": "Background: Improvement of lymphadenectomy in right colectomy requires removal of all tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric vessels beneath the pancreatic notch. Short- and long-term bowel motility disorders after D3 extended mesenterectomy with consecutive superior mesenteric plexus transection are studied. Methods: Patients without pre-existing motility disorders undergoing D3 extended mesenterectomy were examined 3 times using the wireless motility capsule: before, at 3 wk, and 6 mo after surgery. Segmental transit times and contractility were analyzed using mixed effect modeling. Correlation between contractility and transit time was assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Fifteen patients (4 men), with median age 62 y, were included. Mean values for the three consecutive examinations are as follows. Gastric transit time increased from 237 to 402 and 403 min, respectively. Small bowel transit time decreased from 246 to 158 (P < 0.01) and 199 (P = 0.03) min, respectively. Colonic transit time decreased from 1742 to 1450 and 1110 (P = 0.02) min, respectively. Gastric contractions per minute (CPM) varied from 1.73 to 1.05 (P = 0.01) and 2.47 (P < 0.01), respectively. Small bowel CPM decreased from 3.43 to 2.68 and 3.34, respectively. Colonic CPM ranged from 1.59 to 1.45 and 1.91 (P = 0.08), respectively. Correlation between small bowel (SB) transit time and CPM was −0.45 (P = 0.09) preoperatively, and −0.03 (P = 0.91) 6 mo postoperatively. Conclusions: Extrinsic SB denervation leads to significantly accelerated SB transit, reduced contractility, and disturbed correlation between transit time and contractility early after denervation. Both number of contractions and transit time in the denervated SB show a clear tendency toward normalization at 6 mo. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Taxus wallichiana (Himalayan yew) has been subjected to over-exploitation for its anti-cancer ingredient Taxol. As a consequence, the species has already become endangered, facing enhanced threats of regional extinction. To compound this, the species shows high vulnerability to climate change impacts that may significantly reduce its present climatic niche. In spite of the ecological and enormous commercial importance of the species, the direct or indirect impacts of climate change on the species are not yet well-researched and well-documented. To develop sustainable adaptation pathways to conserve the surviving populations of the species, it is important to have precise assessments of the future distribution ranges of the species. The present study models the potential current and future distribution ranges of Taxus wallichiana based on its suitable climatic envelop developed under a baseline scenario (1960–1990) and climate change scenarios centred on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the year 2070, as provided in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the UNO's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The projected shrink in climatic niche of Taxus wallichiana by 28% (RCP 4.5) and 31% (RCP 8.5) highlights the vulnerability of the endangered species to climate change impacts and the perturbations on the structure of mountain ecosystem. It raises an alarm for immediate conservation of geographic areas that can provide potential refuge to the species under the adverse climate change impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Prunus spinosa L. (blackthorn) flower was most recently pointed out as a valuable source of bioactive compounds that have potent anticancer properties. To test for antineoplastic activity, hepatocarcinoma cells (Hepa 1–6) and corresponding non-neoplastic hepatocytes (AML 12) were subjected to Prunus spinosa L. blossom ethanolic extract (5–200 μg mL −1 ). Antiproliferative activity was determined by Trypan Blue (TB) and Kenacid Blue (KB) methods after 24 and 72 h. Inhibitory effects on Hepa 1–6 proliferation were observed at all concentrations with significant inhibition at ≥ 100 μg mL −1 (p &lt;.025–p &lt;.001) determined with both methods. Cytotoxicity was also detected in non-neoplastic hepatocytes with significant doses above 10 μg mL −1 (p &lt;.05–p &lt;.001) after 72 h. Cellular viability loss after 24 h was more pronounced in non-neoplastic vs. hepatocarcinoma cells as confirmed with IC 50TB values (half maximal inhibitory concentration): 59.05 μg mL −1 in AML 12 vs. 166.87 μg mL −1 in Hepa 1–6 cells and IC 50KB : 72.69 vs. 172.93 μg mL −1 , respectively. Prolonged incubation (72 h) resulted in almost equal toxicity in both cell lines. Prooxidative activity of blackthorn flower extract was observed in both cell lines with higher ROS formation in neoplastic cells. Cell death was primarily through necrosis. The proportion of apoptotic cells in both cultures was low: fraction of early apoptosis – 0.04–1.65% of the total cell population and fraction of late apoptosis: only 0.05–3.25%. © 2019 South African Association of Botanists",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Lymphadenectomy is not recommended for low risk stage I endometrial carcinoma (EC) patients. This study was to investigate the predictive value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in predicting patients with low risk EC, and to identify an optimum ADC measurement for preoperative assessment. Materials and methods: Eighty-one patients with stage I EC who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 1.5T were included and divided into low group and intermediate-high risk group based on the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO classification. Clinical indexes, conventional MRI parameters, minimum ADC values (minADC), mean ADC values (meanADC) and relative ADC values (rADC) were compared between those two groups. rADC was calculated using the equation ADC (cancer)/ADC (reference) with the obturator internus muscle as reference. The optimal ADC measurement and cut-off ADC value for low risk EC were calculated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The low risk group had significantly higher meanADC, minADC, and rADC values than did the intermediate-high risk group (1.095 vs. 0.902 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s, 0.755 vs. 0.657 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s, 0.754 vs. 0.603, respectively). In assessments of low risk EC patients, the area under the curve (AUC) values for meanADC, minADC, and rADC were 0.840 (95%CI, 0.749,0.931), 0.681 (95% CI: 0.561,0.800), and 0.876(95% CI: 0.798,0.954), respectively. The optimal cut-off rADC value for prediction was 0.669, the maximum Youden index, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values were 0.683, 81.8%, 86.5%, and 84.0%, respectively. Conclusions: rADC is superior to minADC and meanADC for predicting patients with low risk EC, and could potentially aid to the surgical management of these patients in avoiding unnecessary lymphadenectomy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Diseases occurring near the vocal cords, such as laryngeal cancer, share the initial symptom of hoarseness of voice. The GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) scale is used as an acoustic diagnostic method for these diseases, but its objectivity is not well established. Instead, more accurate diagnosis may be possible by capturing the waveform of the volume velocity at the vocal cords. The aim of this study is to enable voice disturbances to be diagnosed by identifying the sound-source waveform from voice measurements. For acoustic analysis of the vocal tract, we modeled the air inside it as concentrated masses connected by linear springs and dampers. We identified the shape of the vocal tract by making the natural frequencies of the analytical model correspond to the measured formant frequencies, and we calculated the sound-source waveform from the measured voice waveform. To assess the validity of the model, we measured actual voices and used the model to identify the vocal tract shapes and corresponding sound-source waveforms. The identified waveforms have an asymmetrical triangular form, which is a feature of actual human sound-source waveforms. Local solutions allow multiple vocal tract shapes to be identified from a single sample. However, mathematical analysis showed that these differ only in the amplitude of the sound-source waveform, which does not affect the waveform shape. Furthermore, we built an experimental device that simulates the human voice mechanism and comprises an acrylic vocal tract and a piston. We confirmed that the identified sound sources are similar to measured sound sources. We therefore conclude that our proposed methods are valid. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Fractional calculus is a field of mathematics in considerable expansion and has been understood as a tool with a wide range of applications, including in biological systems. Cancer dormancy is a state in which cancer cells have an intrinsic rate of reduced proliferation over a period of time, after which they arise with an accelerated growth rate, usually triggering metastases. This work investigates via fractional calculus two proposed ordinary differential equation systems via fractional calculus, which address dynamics between tumor cells and the immune system. Analyses and comparison processes are performed through an analytical study about the equilibrium points of each model and numerical simulations by the Nonstandard Finite Difference (NSFD) method. The analytical and numerical results show two important behaviors associated with tumor dormancy. The first refers to qualitative changes in the stability of an equilibrium point, which strongly depend on the order of the derivative and represent scenarios where there is no cancer escape. The second behavior refers to changes in the damping of some solutions, which can represent longer periods of time to exit the state of dormancy. In this case, different orders used in the derivatives are investigated, as well as their influence on the behavior of the solutions against the main parameters of the model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Microfluidics brings unique opportunities for engineering micro-/nanomaterials with well-controlled physicochemical properties. Herein, using a miniaturized multi-run spiral-shaped microreactor, we develop a flow synthesis strategy to continuously produce hollow spherical silica (HSS) with hierarchical sponge-like pore sizes ranging from several nanometers to over one hundred nanometers. The formation of HSS is realized by mixing two reactant flows, one containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and diluted ammonia and the other 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) and diluted tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), at a flow rate as high as 5 mL/min. The effect of the reactant concentration and the flow rate on the structural change of the resultant materials is examined. Functional small-sized nanoparticles (magnetic nanoparticle, quantum dot, and silver nanoparticle) can be separately assembled into HSS and high molecular weight protein (bovine serum albumin) can be successfully loaded into HSS and delivered into cancer cells afterward, making them promising in the fields of separation and purification, bioimaging, catalysis, and theranostics. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Metal chalcogenide semiconductor nanomaterials are emerging as a promising photothermal and theranostic agent. In this work, uniform Bi 2 S 3 hollow spheres (HS) have been successfully synthesized by using glycerol (Gly) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as morphology regulator, and L-cysteine (L-Cys) as a sulfur source and surface modifier. The resulting L-Cys/Bi 2 S 3 HS shows a stronger near-infrared (NIR) harvesting capability in comparison with its solid counterpart, and the photothermal conversion efficiency reached up to 31.5%. The nature of hollow structure endows the L-Cys/Bi 2 S 3 HS with higher specific surface area and enhanced drugs loading capacity. As high as 86.4% doxorubicin (DOX) could be loaded to the outer and inner surfaces of L-Cys/Bi 2 S 3 HS and their controlled releasing behavior follow a pH- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the functional group of L-cysteine imparted the HS with good dispersibility and biocompatibility. The novel hollow materials with simultaneous integrated photothermal ablation and drug therapy may be a promising agent for cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapies are at the forefront of the fight against cancers, and researchers continue to develop and test novel immunotherapeutic modalities. Ideal cancer immunotherapies induce a patient's immune system to kill their own cancer and develop long-lasting immunity. Research has demonstrated a critical requirement for CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in achieving durable responses. In the path to the clinic, researchers require robust tools to effectively evaluate the capacity for immunotherapies to generate adaptive anti-tumor responses. To study functional tumor-specific T cells, researchers have relied on targeting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or the inclusion of surrogate transgenes in pre-clinical models, which facilitate detection of T cells by using the targeted antigen(s) in peptide re-stimulation or tetramer-staining assays. Unfortunately, many pre-clinical models lack a defined TAA, and epitope mapping of TAAs is costly. Surrogate transgenes can alter tumor engraftment and influence the immunogenicity of tumors, making them less relevant to clinical tumors. Further, some researchers prefer to develop therapies that do not rely on pre-defined TAAs. Here, we describe a method to exploit major histocompatibility complex expression on murine cancer cell lines in a co-culture assay to detect T cells responding to bulk, undefined, tumor antigens. This is a tool to support the preclinical evaluation of novel, antigen-agnostic immunotherapies. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry various molecules involved in intercellular communication and have raised great interest as drug delivery systems. Several engineering methods have been investigated for vesicle loading. Here, we studied the electroporation of EVs isolated from plasma to load antitumor microRNAs (miRNAs). First, we optimized the transfection protocol using miRNA cel-39 by evaluating different parameters (voltage and pulse) for their effect on vesicle morphology, loading capacity, and miRNA transfer to target cells. When compared with direct incubation of EVs with miRNA, mild electroporation allowed more efficient loading and better protection of miRNA from RNase degradation. Moreover, electroporation preserved the naive vesicle cargo, including RNAs and proteins, and their ability to be taken up by target cells, supporting the absence of vesicle damage. EVs engineered with antitumor miRNAs (miR-31 and miR-451a) successfully promoted apoptosis of the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, silencing target genes involved in anti-apoptotic pathways. Our findings indicate an efficient and functional miRNA encapsulation in plasma-derived EVs following an electroporation protocol that preserves EV integrity. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Paper based biosensor devices have the benefit of easy-use, low-cost and environmental friendly for point-of-care diagnostic application. In this research, we report a novel form of paper based biosensor with hierarchical assembled nanomaterials and MOF enhanced bio-probes for the simultaneous detection of microRNA-141 (miR-141) and microRNA-21 (miR-21) which have the potential for early cancer detection. The combination of multi-dimensional nanomaterial allows low impedance and high sensing area on typical poorly defined paper substrate. MOF conjugated bio-probe, methylene blue (MB) and ferrocene (Fc) with distinguishable electrochemical signal, further contributed to the high selectivity and sensitivity. Simultaneously detection of miR-141 and miR-21 with a detection limit of 0.1 fM was demonstrated under optimal conditions. All these features enable accurately target detection in serum samples. Therefore, this strategy is of promising as an inexpensive, easy access diagnosis platform for cancers by means of simultaneously detection of a variety of miRNA biomarkers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The presence of asbestos in the environment has caused concern because exposure to asbestos can cause diseases such as stomach and pancreatic cancer. However, suitable up-to-date methods for quantitatively analyzing asbestos and assessing the toxicity of asbestos have not been developed. In this study, asbestos in drinking water was characterized using a stepwise multiple differential infra-red spectra method and a partial least squares method. The in vivo migration of ingested asbestos in mice was then investigated using the technique. The quantification limit of six kinds of asbestos by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in water are respectively from 0.0468 to 0.0705 mg/L, from 0.0039 to 0.0064 mg/L. The relative standard deviations were respectively less than 2.85% and 3.81%. The recoveries of the test asbestos were respectively more than 95.10% and 95.38%. Asbestos was found mainly to accumulate in the livers of mice. The Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry method can be used to detect and precisely quantify asbestos in water samples and in animal tissues. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer have an extremely poor 5-year survival rate of 5%. In comparison, all other bladder cancers (BCs) have a 5-year survival rate of 77%. This striking contrast indicates that one of the therapeutic kernels for bladder cancer is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its invasiveness and metastasis. In the current study, we demonstrated that maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is significantly downregulated in human invasive bladder cancers in comparison to non-invasive bladder cancers, and that ectopic expression of MEG3 dramatically inhibits the invasiveness of human bladder cancer cells. Consistently, ectopic expression of MEG3 also attenuates metastatic ability of T24T cells, a cell line derived from T24 cells, in the lungs of nude mice. Our mechanistic studies reveal that MEG3, as a ceRNA, inhibits the invasiveness of human bladder cancer cells via negative regulation of c-Myc by competing with PHLPP2 mRNA for miR-27a. These findings not only provide a novel insight into understanding the mechanisms behind the MEG3 inhibition of bladder cancer cell invasion, but also reveal the potential for use of MEG3 as a tool for the prevention and therapy of invasive bladder cancer. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "The important role of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in tumorigenesis has been well established. The classical model involves IGF-1R binding to IGF-1/2, the following activation of PI3K-Akt-signaling cascades, driving cell proliferation and apoptosis inhibition. Here we report a new signal transduction pathway of IGF-1R in the intestinal epithelium. Using heterozygous knockout mice (Igf1r +/− ), we analyzed the expressions of viral RNA sensors MDA5 and RIG-I in the intestinal epithelium. Igf1r +/− mice exhibited higher MDA5 and RIG-I than wild-type (WT) mice, indicating that knockdown of IGF-1R could trigger MDA5 and RIG-I. IGF-1R knockdown-triggered MDA5 and RIG-I were further investigated in human colonic cancer cells. Increased MDA5 and RIG-I were clearly seen in the cytoplasm in cancer cells as well as normal human colonic cells with silenced IGF-1R. Notably, the upregulations of MDA5 and RIG-I was not affected by blockage of the PI3K-Akt pathway with LY294002. These results suggested a new signal transduction pathway of IGF-1R. Importantly, IGF-1R knockdown-triggered MDA5 and RIG-I resulted in colorectal cancer apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial pathway. These in vitro observations were evidenced in the azoxymethane (AOM)-dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colorectal cancer model of mice. In conclusion, knockdown of IGF-1R triggers viral RNA sensor MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in cancer cells. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "We previously found that lung tumor development was reduced in a presenilin (PS) Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Here, we investigated whether this reducing effect could occur in a different AD mouse model. We investigated urethane-induced (1 mg/g) lung tumor development and melanoma growth in Swedish amyloid precursor protein (SwAPP) transgenic mice. The expression of chitinase-3-like-1 (Chi3L1) increased during lung tumor development and melanoma growth, which was accompanied by an increase in the activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the downregulation of miRNA342-3p in wild-type mice. Like tumor development, the expression of Chi3L1 and STAT3 activity was reduced in the SwAPP mice, whereas the expression of miRNA342-3p was upregulated. In addition, Chi3L1 knockdown in the lung cancer and melanoma tissues reduced cancer cell growth and STAT3 activity but enhanced miRNA342-3p expression. However, the miRNA342-3p mimic decreased Chi3L1 expression, cancer cell growth, and STAT3 activity. Moreover, a STAT3 inhibitor reduced Chi3L1 expression and cancer cell growth but enhanced miRNA342-3p expression. These data showed that lung tumor development was reduced through the decrease of Chi3L1 expression via the STAT3-dependent upregulation of miRNA342-3p. This study indicates that lung tumor development could be reduced in SwAPP AD mice. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence revealed that dysregulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in tumorigenesis and progression. This study is supposed to reveal the effects of lncRNA PVT1 on the radiosensitivity of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via the microRNA (miR)-424-5p/lncRNA PVT1/CARM1 signaling pathway. Differentially expressed lncRNA was filtrated. The co-expressed gene of lncRNA was predicted, and gene ontology analysis was performed to find out the genes associated with NSCLC radiosensitivity. The miR that was combined with lncRNA and mRNA was filtrated. Two cell lines with the highest expressed PVT1 were selected, followed by transfection with a series of different mimic, inhibitor, or siRNA. RIP assay was employed for the interaction between PVT1 and CARM1. The regulatory effect of miR-424-5p on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cycle, and apoptosis was investigated. PVT1 was the most remarkable lncRNA that upregulated in NSCLC. CARM1 co-expressed with lncRNA PVT1 and associated with NSCLC radiosensitivity. Both lncRNA PVT1 and CARM1 can combine with miR-424-5p. Increased PVT1, CARM1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Bcl-2 and decreased miR-424-5p and Bax were found in NSCLC tissues. PVT1 was targeted by miR-424-5p. After silencing of PVT1 or overexpressed miR-424-5p, decreased PVT1, CARM1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Bcl-2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion but promoted miR-424-5p, Bax, and cell apoptosis. The present study confirms the radiosensitivity of NSCLC radiotherapy can be increased by siRNA-PVT1 and overexpressed miR-424-5p. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "A number of studies have reported that aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) closely correlates with the bone metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). However, clinical significance and functional roles of both strands of a single miRNA in bone metastasis of PCa remain undefined. Here, we reported that miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p expression were simultaneously reduced in bone metastatic PCa tissues compared with non-bone metastatic PCa tissues. Downexpression of miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p strongly and positively correlated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics and shorter bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. Upregulating miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p inhibited invasion and migration abilities of PCa cells in vitro, as well as repressed bone metastasis in vivo. Our results further revealed that miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p attenuated bone metastasis of PCa via inhibiting transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling by simultaneously targeting several components of TGF-β signaling, including SMAD2, SMAD4, TGF-β receptor I (TGFBRI), and TGFBRII. Moreover, deletion contributes to miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p downexpression in PCa tissues. Finally, clinical negative correlations of miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p with SMAD2, SMAD4, TGFBRI, and TGFBRII were demonstrated in PCa tissues. Thus, our findings explore a novel tumor-suppressive miRNA with its both strands implicated in bone metastasis of PCa, suggesting its potential therapeutic value in treatment of PCa bone metastasis. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Hematite nanoparticles (NPs) are chemically and thermodynamically more stable among iron oxide NPs therefore these are considered highly suitable for biomedical applications. This work explores Rhus punjabensis extract potential as both reducing and capping agent for phytomediated synthesis of NPs from ferric chloride precursor. The structural, morphological and compositional investigations were carried out with XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, and FFT. The synthesized NPs were hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ) with rhombohedral crystal structure of an approximate size of 41.5 ± 5 nm. TEM, FTIR, and TG/DTA indicated phase-pure Fe 2 O 3 formation with controlled size through use of capping agent. Biological activities depict that synthesized NPs had free radical scavenging, antioxidative potential and reducing power activities. These activities are due to phenolic and flavonoid like properties by attachment of different functional groups on the surface of NPs. The NPs exhibited significant Antileishmanial, antibacterial and protein kinase inhibition activities as compared with the corresponding plant extract. NPs depicted cytotoxic effect against HL-60 leukemic and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines with ED 50 values of 11.9 and 12.79 μg/ml, respectively. The inhibitory effect observed in the NF-κB assay suggested apoptotic potential of hematite NPs to cancerous cells. The green chemistry route reported in this paper for Fe 2 O 3 NP synthesis can be safely and efficiently explored for treatment of cancer and as theranostic agent. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Despite of great attention concerned on ceramic nanostructures in bioapplications, little is known about the toxicity of these NPs at the cellular and molecular levels. In this work, mesoporous nanocomposite of CuCo 2 O 4 /CuO synthesized by sonochemical assistant thermal decomposition and the anti-cancer effect was studied as well. The environmental friendly method by surfactant free as well as low temperature was applied. A natural complex of copper-cobalt-coccus prepared by sonochemical method and finally decomposed thermally at 600 °C. CuCo 2 O 4 /CuO mesoporous nanocomposites were successfully obtained through one-way reaction and characterized by; x-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Furthermore, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) was used to study the magnetic properties of CuCo 2 O 4 /CuO nanoparticles. MTT assay was performed in order to determine the anti-proliferative effect of CuCo 2 O 4 /CuO samples against 4T1 breast cancer cell lines. CuCo 2 O 4 /CuO nanoparticles induced dose-dependent cytotoxic effects against 4T1 breast cancer cells with IC 50 of 0.82 mg/ml. Nevertheless, it is essential to perform more investigations to find the exact related mechanisms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Four bisnaphthalimides derivatives 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b with polyamine linkage have been synthesized and characterized. Different spectroscopic techniques, including UV–Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), have been used to explore the interaction of these compounds with G-quadruplex structures (Htelo, c-myc, c-kit). The compounds 3a, 3b and 5b show high affinity toward Htelo, c-myc and c-kit G-quadruplexes (K a &gt; 4.42 × 10 6 M −1 ), and exhibit more than 40-fold selectivity for the quadruplex versus CT DNA. Binding of 3a, 3b to telomeric and oncogenic G-quadruplexes induce strong enhancement of the fluorescence intensity (18–27-fold), whereas the duplex CT DNA induces much weaker fluorescence enhancement (around 2-fold). Being fluorescent, the cellular localization of 3a, 3b can be conveniently tracked by fluorescence imaging. The results indicate that 3a, 3b can readily be taken up by A549 lung cancer cells. Molecular docking studies indicate that 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b mainly bind in the groove and/or loop region of the G-quadruplexes, and hydrogen bonding plays an important role in the interaction of bisnaphthalimide derivatives with G-quadruplexes. CD spectroscopy and FRET melting assay indicate that 3a, 3b and 5b can promote the formation and the stabilization of human telomeric and c-myc G-quadruplex DNA. The compound 3b can inhibit the growth of A549 cells (IC 50 = 0.15 μM), with a much higher antitumor activity than amonafide. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: We aimed to review the burden and the potential impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines on HPV-related diseases in the Republic of Korea and to discuss cervical cancer prevention practices in this country. Methods: Cancer burden statistics were retrieved from GLOBOCAN-2018 and Statistics Korea. HPV disease burden was assessed via systematic review. Vaccine types relative contribution (RC) was estimated using data from an international project using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Results: Despite a downtrend in cervical cancer in recent years, Korean rates remain high. In contrast, oropharyngeal cancer incidence has gradually increased and other anogenital cancers remain rare. In Korea, HPV prevalence in general population is around 20%. In cervical cancer, RC of HPVs 16/18 (74.0%) increased to 92.0% when including HPVs 31/33/45/52/58. Limited information was available for other HPV-related cancer sites. Regarding prevention, since the inclusion of the HPV vaccine into the National Immunization Program, almost half (49%) of the target cohort in 2016 had received the first dose of vaccine. Further, percentage of women screened with pap has increased from 41.1%-2009 to 53.0%-2016. Conclusions: HPV-related disease burden in Korea is significant. Results suggest that the combination of effective and high coverage HPV vaccination and screening programmes could substantially impact on HPV-related disease in Korea. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "We examined what proportion of the U.S. population with no personal cancer history reported receiving either genetic counseling or genetic testing for cancer risk, and also the association of these behaviors with cancer risk perceptions. We used data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey. Objective relative risk scores for breast (women) and colorectal (men and women) cancer risk were generated for individuals without a personal history of cancer. Participants' risk perceptions were compared with their objective relative risk. Of 12,631 women, 1.2% reported receiving genetic counseling and 0.8% genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer risk. Of 15,085 men and women, 0.8% reported receiving genetic counseling and 0.3% genetic testing for hereditary colorectal cancer risk. Higher breast cancer risk perception was associated with genetic counseling (OR: 4.31, 95%CI: 2.56, 7.26) and testing (OR: 3.56, 95%CI: 1.80, 7.03). Similarly, higher perception of colorectal cancer risk was associated with genetic counseling (OR: 5.04, 95%CI: 2.57, 9.89) and testing (OR: 5.92, 95%CI: 2.40, 14.63). A higher proportion of individuals with colorectal cancer risk perceptions concordant with their objective risk (vs. discordant) had undergone genetic counseling or testing for colorectal cancer risk. Concordant risk perceptions for breast cancer were not associated with breast cancer genetic counseling or testing. Given frequent dialogue about implementing population level programs involving genetic services for cancer risk, policy makers and investigators should consider the role of risk perceptions in the effectiveness and design of such programs and potential strategies for addressing inaccuracies in risk perceptions. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer has emerged as the most common female malignancy globally and in Nigeria in the past few decades. Little is currently known at the household level about breast cancer screening practices of the Nigerian women. Study objectives: The study assessed awareness, knowledge and practice of women in Ogbomoso South Local Government Area (LGA) on breast cancer screening. Methodology: The study employed Community-based cross-sectional design and multi-stage sampling technique was used to recruit 332 consenting women. Interviewer-guided, self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 40.8 ± 13 years; 44.9% of the women had ever screened for breast cancer. Factors that were significantly associated with practice of breast cancer screening included having tertiary education (p < 0.001), ever use of family planning methods (p = 0.018), ever heard of breast cancer (p < 0.001), ever heard of breast examination (p<0.001), having relatives who had died of breast cancer (p = 0.018) and having good knowledge of the disease (p < 0.001). Women who were aware of screening were eight times more likely to have practised breast cancer screening compared to those who had no knowledge (aOR 7.6, 95%CI 4.1–14.2). Conclusion: Knowledge and practice of breast cancer screening were low among community based women. There is urgent need to intensify breast cancer awareness campaigns among this population in Nigeria. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Cancer has high incidence in both developed and developing countries. Epidemiological data on the rate of cancer incidence in Brazil appears not to have a strong impact on government policies to fund research and innovation in health, particularly in oncology. This study aimed to verify this suspicion by retrospectively analysing data from the Brazilian government's Financier of Studies and Projects (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP) and The National Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial, INPI) on cancer research and innovation in Brazil from 1998 to 2013. Our results indicated that, in the study period, the increased rate of cancer incidence in Brazil was not accompanied by government funding for cancer research since only 9% of the budget approved to health research, and innovation, was spent on cancer research. In addition, the number of projects approved for developing infrastructure to support cancer research was limited, corresponding to 0.46% of the total budget. The number of applications for registration of patents of chemical and biotechnological drugs for cancer showed a reduction, reflecting the low investment in oncology. In conclusion, there are deficits in governmental funding of cancer research and innovation in Brazil. Therefore, effective measures to coordinate funding policies and effective criteria for funding allocation should be implemented to avoid further negative consequences for the population and the public health scenario. Moreover, increased governmental and non-governmental funding could help to improve the current precarious situation that limits the population's access to health goods and services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is common cancer among women with high morbidity. MicroRNAs (miRs) are involved in the progression and development of cervical cancer. This study aimed to explore the effect of miR-99b-5p (miR-99b) on invasion and migration in cervical cancer through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The microarray-based analysis was used to screen out differentially expressed miRNAs. Expression of miR-99b, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) was determined in both cervical cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues. Next, alteration of miR-99b expression in cervical cancer was conducted to evaluate levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, p70S6K matrix metallopeptidase 2, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, as well as the effect of miR-99b on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that miR-99b expression was decreased and levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and p70S6K were elevated in cervical cancer tissues. More important, overexpressed miR-99b repressed the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, blocked cell cycle entry, and promoted apoptosis in cervical cancer. These results indicate that miR-99b attenuates the migration and invasion of human cervical cancer cells through downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which provides a therapeutic approach for cervical cancer treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Considering the drawbacks in the cancer chemotherapies, there is an unmet need for alternative therapeutic approaches such as herbal medicines. The aim of this study was assessment the anticancer effect of Physalis alkekengi (P. alkekengi) hydroalcoholic extract on mouse model of breast cancer. The therapeutic and anticancer effect of a P. alkekengi hydroalcoholic extract was investigated using an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer mouse model. We observed that the extract of P. alkekengi inhibited the growth of the breast cancer cells at the two higher doses (50 and 100 mg/kg). Accordingly, we found a significant histopathologic alteration in the breast cancer cells in group treated with the P. alkekengi hydroalcoholic extract compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, we observed that the P. alkekengi extract could significantly increase the mRNA level expression of apoptosis specific gene Bax in the effective dosage treated group (50 mg/kg). Our findings revealed that the hydroalcoholic extract of P. alkekengi has an incredible efficacy for the treatment of estrogen-positive breast cancer by promoting the apoptotic pathways into this tumor type. Further studies are essential regarding complete verification of it safety and anticancer effects on other cancer types. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Rapid proliferation and metastasis of breast cancers resulted in poor prognosis in clinic. Recent studies have proved that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in tumor progression. In this study, we aimed to determine the roles and mechanisms of lncRNA–cell division cycle 6 (CDC6) in regulating proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer. Clinically, lncRNA–CDC6 was highly expressed in tumor tissues and was positively correlated with clinical stages of breast cancers. Functionally, the ectopic expression of lncRNA–CDC6 promoted proliferation via regulation of G1 phase checkpoint, and further promoting the migration capability. Moreover, lncRNA–CDC6 could function as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) via directly sponging of microRNA-215 (miR-215), which further regulating the expression of CDC6. Taken together, our results proved that lncRNA–CDC6 could function as ceRNA and promote the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells, which provided a novel prognostic marker for breast cancers in clinic. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study was performed to determine if there was a difference in immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) rates between our public hospital and private cancer center, which share a common faculty with a consistent management philosophy in multidisciplinary care. We investigated the factors affecting postmastectomy reconstruction and IBR rates. Materials and methods: We retrospectively identified women with clinical stage I-II breast cancer who underwent mastectomy at our public hospital, Los Angeles County Medical Center, and our private cancer center, Keck Hospital of USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to study predictors of IBR and any breast reconstruction. Results: Of 293 mastectomy patients, the rate of any breast reconstruction at the private cancer (56.6%) center was higher than that at the public hospital (36.2%). IBR rates for the private cancer center (93.6%) and for patients with private insurance were higher than for the public hospital (40.8%) and likewise for those without insurance (86.7% versus 45.5%). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IBR at our private cancer center were 22.96 times higher than that at our public hospital. Age >50 y and radiotherapy were independent predictive factors associated with less likelihood of any breast reconstruction. Conclusions: Patients at the public hospital had a much lower rate of breast reconstruction than the private cancer center patients, even after controlling for stage and the team of treating physicians. Our results showed that older age and radiotherapy affect rates of breast reconstruction, as do hospital system and insurance status. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Successful treatment of pancreatic cancer, which has the highest mortality rate among all types of malignancies, has challenged oncologists for decades, and early detection would undoubtedly increase favorable patient outcomes. The identification of proteins involved in pancreatic cancer progression could lead to biomarkers for early detection of this disease. This study identifies one potential candidate, cylindromatosis (CYLD), a deubiquitinase and microtubule-binding protein that plays a suppressive role in pancreatic cancer development. In pancreatic cancer samples, downregulation of CYLD expression resulted from a loss in the copy number of the CYLD gene; additionally, reduced expression of CYLD negatively correlated with the clinicopathological parameters. Further study demonstrated that CYLD deficiency promoted colony formation in vitro and pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that CYLD is essential for spindle orientation and properly oriented cell division; CYLD deficiency resulted in a substantial increase in chromosome missegregation. Taken together, these data indicate a critical role for CYLD in suppressing pancreatic tumorigenesis, implicating its potential as a biomarker for early detection of pancreatic cancer and a prognostic indicator of patient outcomes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Inflammation-based prognostic scores are associated with tumor recurrence and survival in various cancers. The aim of this study was to identify the significance of inflammation-based prognostic scores and to detect the most useful score in patients with distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods: Between 2000 and 2015, 121 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. The relationship between clinicopathological variables including various prognostic scores and disease-free (DFS) as well as overall (OS) survival was investigated by univariate analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to compare the predictive ability of each scoring system. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the clinicopathological variables associated. Results: In univariate analysis, Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), mGPS, C-reactive protein/Alb ratio score, prognostic index, and preoperative monocyte count were significant risk factors for both DFS and OS. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of GPS is consistently larger in comparison with other four scores in both DFS as well as OS. In multivariate analysis, GPS was an independent risk factor of both tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Conclusions: GPS score is an independent tumor recurrence and prognostic factor in patients with distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer and is superior to the other prognostic scores. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Despite being preventable, cervical cancer remains the most common cancer among women in Nepal, a country where there is no nationwide screening programme. Hence, the objective was to investigate and better understand Nepali women's perceptions on barriers to participation in cervical cancer screening and what might facilitate their participation. Methods: A qualitative study design with focus group discussions was employed and women were purposively invited. The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using manifest content analysis. Findings: Women had misconceptions about the screening and low levels of knowledge. Sociocultural barriers, service providers’ behaviour, geographical challenges, and limited finances were all perceived as obstacles to attending screening centres. Facilitating factors, such as participation in awareness programmes and support from family and women's groups, may convince women to attend screening clinics. Conclusions: The findings contribute information on Nepalese women's perceptions of cervical cancer screening. They may serve to support the Government of Nepal's promotion of cervical cancer screening and treatment as a right for all Nepali women, whenever necessary. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer continues to be a major public health problem. Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in the initiation and progression of cancer, few studies focus on the lncRNAs in the cervical cancer. Here, we systematically studied the clinical information, transcriptome profiling, and methylation array data of cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma that retrieved from genomic data commons (GDC). Compared with protein-coding genes, the expression levels of pseudogenes and lncRNAs were much lower. A total of 190 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 2,326 protein-coding genes were identified. Meanwhile, 269 differentially methylation regions (DMRs), where 16 lncRNAs were located, were figured out. Only one lncRNA, LINC00592, which was located in the DMRs, was also found differentially expressed. Several transcriptional regulation genes, such as ZNF20, ZNF441, ZNF573, and TMF1, were highly correlated with the expression of LINC00592, which illustrated its possible function on the transcription. Two microRNAs, which were both associated with tumor progression, can bind to LINC00592. Moreover, LINC00592 were also differentially expressed in other tumors. We proposed, with the help of various databases, that LINC00592 is a potential cancer-related lncRNA in cervical cancer and might activate the cancer progression through the regulation of transcription or structural integrity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Serine plays critically important roles in tumorigenesis. Homo sapiens 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) catalyzes the first committed step for the synthesis of glucose-derived serine via the phosphoserine pathway and has been associated with a wide variety of cancers, including breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, glioma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cervical adenocarcinoma, etc. Azacoccone E, an aza-epicoccone derivative from the culture of Aspergillus flavipes, exhibited effective inhibitory activity against PHGDH in vitro. The microscale thermophoresis (MST) method and the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) confirmed that azacoccone E directly bound to PHGDH. And the cell-based experiments showed that this compound was selectively toxic to PHGDH-dependent cancer cells and could cause apoptosis. Further biochemical assays revealed that it was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate of 3-PG and exhibited a time-dependent inhibition. Furthermore, molecular docking demonstrated that azacoccone E coordinated in an allosteric site of PHGDH with low binding energy. Therefore, azacoccone E can be considered as a possible drug candidate targeting at PHGDH for treatment of cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The conventional treatment (cytoreduction combined with cisplatin/carboplatin and taxane drugs) of ovarian cancer has a high rate of failure and recurrence despite a favorable initial response. This lack of success is usually attributed to the development of multidrug resistance mechanisms by cancer cells and avoidance of the anti-growth effects of monoclonal targeted therapeutic antibodies. The disease, like other cancers, is characterized by the overexpression of molecular markers, including HER2 receptors. Preclinical and clinical studies with trastuzumab, a HER2-targeted therapeutic antibody, reveal a low improvement of the outcomes of HER2 positive ovarian cancer patients. Therefore, here, we propose a cisplatin-loaded, HER2 targeted poly(lactic-co-glycolic) nanoplatform, a system capable to escape the drug-efflux effect and to take advantage of the overexpressed HER2 receptors, using them as docks for targeted chemotherapy. The NP/trastuzumab ratio was determined after fluorescein labeling of antibodies and quantification of fluorescence in NPs. The system was also characterized in terms of size, zeta potential, drug release kinetics, cytotoxicity and cellular internalization in the epithelial ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3, and compared with the HER2 negative breast cancer cell line HCC70. Our results show an increased cytotoxicity of NPs as compared to free cisplatin, and moreover, an enhanced internalization and cytotoxicity due to the bionfunctionalization of NPs with the monoclonal antibody. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Women diagnosed with breast cancer during working age are at increased risk of permanent absence from work, but the underlying medical causes have rarely been studied. We examined the risk of cause-specific sick leave, disability pension, and the competing event death after a breast cancer diagnosis in a population-based cohort study. Materials and methods: From the Breast Cancer Data Base Sweden, we identified 16,603 women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between 2000 and 2012, and 63,773 control women. Using multi-state modelling, we calculated probabilities and durations of sick leave, disability pension, and death by registered cause, together with cause-specific hazard ratios. Results: Five years after diagnosis, causes other than cancer accounted for around half of all sick leave (3.5% out of 6.8% of women) and disability pension (1.4% out of 2.6%) in women with breast cancer. Compared with control women, women with breast cancer were at increased risk of sick leave and disability pension due to mental disorders (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.15–1.33 and HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.29–1.85, respectively) and disability pension due to inflammatory diseases (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05–2.03). The risk of sick leave and disability pension due to cardiovascular disease was also elevated, although only statistically significant for disability pension in women diagnosed after 2005 (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.22–4.13). Conclusion: Follow-up, support, and rehabilitation programs for women diagnosed with breast cancer must address a wide range of psychological and physical conditions to limit the consequences on working life. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is one of the most aggressive and pervasive cancers identified in females. Sirt1 and CD36 both exert an essential role toward the oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells. As reported, the adrenergic signaling could promote the malignancy of breast cancer. This study focuses specifically on the role of Sirt1/CD36 in the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and also investigates their response to the α2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (Dex). Materials and Methods: Expression of Sirt1 and CD36 was measured in breast cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry. We cultured MCF7 cells and treated cells with resveratrol (RSV) or Dex. Western blot analysis was performed to quantify the protein expression levels. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was applied to detect cell proliferation. Results: Compared with normal adjacent tissues, Sirt1 increased and CD36 decreased in cancer tissues. RSV, a Sirt1 activator, increased the proliferation of MCF-7 cells at low concentration but exerted cytotoxicity effect at higher concentration. Sirt1 activation increased the expression of CD36 at higher concentration. Dex treatment gradually increased the proliferation of MCF7 cells in a dose-dependent manner and downregulated the expression of Sirt1/CD36. Interestingly, overexpression of Sirt1 via RSV pretreatment could suppress Dex-stimulated proliferation of breast cancer, accompanied with CD36 upregulation. Conclusions: though expression of Sirt1 increased in breast cancer progression, overexpression of Sirt1 could inhibit MCF7 proliferation, which may be associated with CD36 upregulation. In addition, the promotion effect of Dex on MCF7 cells, which may be associated with the Sirt1/CD36 inhibition, could be weakened by Sirt1 activation via RSV. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is the most common cause of female cancer-related mortality worldwide. Decreased expression of long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) is found in human cervical cancer tissues and associated with poor prognosis. However, the studies on associations between GAS5 level and malignant phenotypes, as well as sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug in cervical cancer cells are limited. In this study, overexpression of GAS5 in cervical cancer cells resulted in prohibited cell proliferation and colony formation, which were promoted by siGAS5. Enhanced GAS5 increased cell percentage in the G0/G1 phase and decreased cells percentage in the S phase, whereas reduced expression did not. The malignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells, manifested by cell migration and invasion, could be weakened by the GAS5 overexpression and enhanced by siGAS5. Furthermore, in cisplatin-induced cell, overexpression of GAS5 reduced cells viability and enhanced apoptosis, whereas in cells transfected with siGAS5, apoptosis eliminated. We have reported the upregulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and its oncogenetic roles in cervical cancer previously. In this study, we found the negative relationship between the GAS5 and miR-21. Moreover, the decrease of miR-21 associated proteins phosphorylated STAT3 and E2F3 was seen in GAS5 overexpressed cells, both of which could be increased by siGAS5. The GAS5 deficiency also reduced miR-21 target proteins TIMP3 and PDCD4 expressions. Taken together, the GAS5 expression level is inversely associated with malignancy, but positively associated with sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that GAS5 could be a biomarker of cisplatin-resistance in clinical therapy of human cervical cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer, with unsatisfactory survival rates, is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Recent advances in the genetic basis of breast cancer have benefitted the development of gene-based medicines and therapies. Tissue engineering technologies, including tissue decellularizations and reconstructions, are potential therapeutic alternatives for cancer research and tissue regeneration. In our study, human breast cancer biopsies were decellularized by a detergent technique, with sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) solution, for the first time. And the decellularization process was optimized to maximally maintain tissue microarchitectures and extracellular matrix (ECM) components with minimal DNA compounds preserved. Histology analysis and DNA quantification results confirmed the decellularization effect with maximal genetic compounds removal. Quantification, immunofluorescence, and histology analyses demonstrated better preservation of ECM components in 0.5% SLES-treated scaffolds. Scaffolds seeded with MCF-7 cells demonstrated the process of cell recellularization in vitro, with increased cell migration, proliferation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. When treated with 5-fluorouracil, the expressions of stem cell markers, including Oct4, Sox2, and CD49F, were maximally maintained in the recellularized scaffold with decreased apoptosis rates compared with monolayer cells. These results showed that the decellularized breast scaffold model with SLES treatments would help to simulate the pathogenesis of breast cancer in vitro. And we hope that this model could further accelerate the development of effective therapies for breast cancer and benefit drug screenings. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The efficacy of therapy for cervical cancer is related to the alteration of multiple molecular events and signaling networks during treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate gene expression alterations in advanced cervical cancers before- and after-trans-uterine arterial chemoembolization- (TUACE). Methods: Gene expression patterns in three squamous cell cervical cancers before- and after-TUACE were determined using microarray technique. Changes in AKAP12 and CA9 genes following TUACE were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed that the after-TUACE samples clustered together, which were separated from the before-TUACE samples. Using a 2-fold threshold, we identified 1131 differentially expressed genes that clearly discriminate after-TUACE tumors from before-TUACE tumors, including 209 up-regulated genes and 922 down-regulated genes. Pathway analysis suggests these genes represent diverse functional categories. Results from real-time PCR confirmed the expression changes detected by microarray. Conclusions: Gene expression signature significantly changes during TUACE therapy of cervical cancer. Theses alterations provide useful information for the development of novel treatment strategies for cervical cancers on the molecular level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer cells have intrinsic property to modulate their microenvironment and resist a wide array of stimuli including temperature disparity more efficiently than healthy cells by activating several homeostatic molecular mechanisms to sustain and prevent death. Although, oncogenic hyperthermia has been proved to induce anti-tumor effects in cancer cells through various regulatory mechanisms, the other critical molecular regulators are not studied in detail. Furthermore hypothermia is the far less studied conditions in cancer cell systems. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are primary heat response regulators. Several studies have reported key roles of HSP-90 in neoplasias. However, the role of HSP-70 transcripts in cancer cells during hypo and hyperthermic exposure remains understudied. Methods: In present study, the role of HSP-70 gene transcripts such as HSPA1A, HSPA4, HSPA8, HSPA9 and HSPA14 in two human breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 during direct exposure to hypo and hyperthermia (ranging from 33 °C to 42 °C) has been explored in time dependent manner. Results: Both the cancer cell lines showed significant changes in cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis post-hypo and hyperthermic exposure. Relative gene expression analysis showed significantly elevated expression of HSP-70 transcripts more specifically HSPA8 and HSPA14 post-hyperthermia exposure. Two different proliferative natures of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines showed significant variation in their transcripts expression suggesting that the HSP-70 genes expression may vary critically in normal and aggressive tumor environment. Conclusion: The present study indicates significance of HSPA8 and HSPA14 in regulating sustained behavior of cancer cells in cell and time dependent manner during hypo and hyperthermic exposure. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cancer therapeutics development has been a challenge due to their untoward side effects and cytotoxicity. Phytochemical anti-cancer drugs have several advantages over chemical chemotherapeutic drugs as they are less cytotoxic and have a greater pharmacological advantage. However, lack of targeting ability limits the use of phytochemicals at a great extent for a successful therapeutic strategy. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have long been used to load the therapeutic cargo and provided significant advantages over conventional chemo-therapeutics. In this present study, we report the synthesis and testing of various biosynthesized AuNPs (b-AuNPs) using naturally derived phytochemicals (Curcumin: Cur, Turmeric: Tur, Quercetin: Qu and Paclitaxel: Pacli). The synthesized b-AuNPs have been well characterized by different Physicochemical techniques. Cytotoxic potential of these b-AuNPs were evaluated in different breast cancer cells either in an individual or in a combination forms. We have observed the maximum therapeutic activity in a combination of all four types of b-AuNPs (AuNPs-Cur, AuNPs-Tur, AuNPs-Qu and AuNPs-Pacli) as compared to their pristine administration. Further, mechanistic studies of these compounds revealed that, combinations of AuNPs-Cur, AuNPs-Tur, AuNPs-Qu and AuNPs-Pacli were significantly effective in inhibiting cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, colony formation and spheroid formation predicting a synergistic effect when compared to individual treatment against different breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231). Interestingly the nanoconjugates alone or in combinations did not show cytotoxicity towards human embryonic normal kidney cell line (HEK 293), demonstrating the biocompatibility. Together the results demonstrated the potential anti-cancer properties of b-AuNPs in a combinatorial approach that could be the future of cancer nanomedicine. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The novel method was developed for electrochemical cancer cell detection using CuO/WO 3 nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide nanosheet (CuO/WO 3 -GO) with enhanced peroxidase like-activity, based on catalytic reaction of H 2 O 2 with o-Phenylenediamine (OPD). The prepared nanocomposite conjugated with folic acid (FA), as a cancer cell-targeting ligand, and a miniaturized electrochemical cell for cancer cell detection was designed. In this strategy OPD could oxidize in the presence of H 2 O 2 on the surface of working electrode, which produced an electrochemical signal. However, the redox response signal changed by interaction of cells with FA/CuO/WO 3 -GO. During interaction between cells and CuO/WO 3 -GO, some amount of H 2 O 2 –OPD system participated in chemical reaction and removed from the electrode, resulting in a decrease in the response signal. As a consequence, cancer cells detected in wide detection range of 50 to 10 5 cells/mL and a detection limit of 18 cells/mL. Furthermore, the nanocomposite shows therapeutic cancer treatment through superior peroxidase activity. This work unveils an effective method for simple, sensitive and selective monitoring of cancer cells and also has the potential for efficient cancer therapy, which will open an avenue of nanozymes toward biological applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "As an over-expressed flavoprotein in several kinds of tumor cells, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) is considered as a potent biomarker in early-stage cancer diagnosis. Developing a fast, selective and sensitive method of monitoring NQO1 on cellular level will greatly promote cancer diagnosis in clinical practice. In this paper, a fast NQO1 responsive fluorescence probe SYZ-30 containing quinone acid and 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) fluorophore is constructed. The probe could selectively respond to NQO1 and rapidly emit strong fluorescence in vitro within only 5 min. Notably, the peak fluorescent intensities at 550 nm showed a linear relationship with NQO1 concentrations in the range of 3–30 ng/ml and limit of detection (LOD) was 0.0667 ng/ml. Furthermore, it was validated that the probe has good biocompatibility and could be applied for bio-imaging in NQO1 over-expressed cancer cells, together with its mitochondria targeting ability. Importantly, confocal fluorescence imaging confirmed the NQO1 detection ability on cellular level, which can be used for real-time detection of several cancer subtypes like adenocarcinoma. To conclude, the probe is rapidly responsive, highly sensitive and selective which will potentially become a practical tool for early cancer detection and diagnosis. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Stromal interaction molecules STIM1 and STIM2 are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ sensors that initiate store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE). The roles of STIM1-mediated SOCE in cancer biology have been highlighted in different types of cancer, but that of STIM2 is unknown. By the model of cervical cancer, here we focus on the cooperative regulation of SOCE by STIM proteins and their distinct roles in cellular function. Immunofluorescent stainings of surgical specimens of cervical cancer show that STIM1 and STIM2 are abundant in tumor tissues, but STIM1 is the major ER Ca 2+ sensor identified in the invasive front of cancer tissues. STIM1 or STIM2 overexpression in cervical cancer SiHa cells induces an upregulated SOCE. Regarding cellular function, STIM1 and STIM2 are necessary for cell proliferation, whereas STIM1 is the dominant ER Ca 2+ sensor involved in cell migration. During SOCE, STIM1 is aggregated and translocated towards the Orai1-containing plasma membrane in association with the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB1. In contrast, STIM2 is constitutively aggregated without significant trafficking or association with microtubules. These results show the distinct role of STIM1 and STIM2 in SOCE and cellular function of cervical cancer cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Evidence is emerging that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in tumorigenesis. LncRNA gastric cancer-associated transcript 3 (GACAT3) is reported to participate in the development of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer. However, whether it is implicated in glioma has not been elucidated. Here, we found that GACAT3 level was aberrantly elevated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Higher GACAT3 expression predicted lower survival rate. Knockdown of GACAT3 suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion but promoting apoptosis in glioma cells. Next, we determined that GACAT3 contributes to glioma progression through inhibiting microRNA (miR)-3127-5p. Subsequently, ELAVL1 was identified as a direct target of miR-3127-5p by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, we confirmed that GACAT3 promoted ELAVL1 expression through sponging miR-3127-5p, leading to glioma progression. Taken together, our study elucidated that GACAT3/miR-3127-5p/ELAVL1 signaling regulates glioma development and might be a promising therapeutic target. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women, and despite improved treatments, it remains a major challenge. However, improved mechanistic insight may lead to novel therapeutic strategies. miR-142-3p belongs to the miR-142 family and is involved in pathogenesis and metastasis of various types of malignancies by targeting several important messenger RNAs (mRNAs) including Bach-1. This is especially true for breast cancer, where Bach-1 is involved in the metastatic spread by deregulation of metastasis-associated genes. Methods: In this study, we collected 24 breast cancer tissues with 24 adjusted normal tissues to measure the expression levels of miR-142-3p and Bach-1 mRNA using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and IHC. miR-142-3p targeting of Bach-1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells was evaluated using bioinformatics, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. The cellular proliferation, invasion, and migration were assessed by MTT, transwell matrigel and wound healing assay and the EMT-associated proteins C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) were analyzed by western blot analysis. Also, the expression levels of tumor suppressors including miR-330, miR-145, and miR-34a were estimated by qRT-PCR. Results: Analysis of paired specimens of primary malignant and normal tissues showed that miR-142-3p was downregulated, while Bach-1 mRNA and protein both were overexpressed in the breast cancer tumors. This inverse relationship was confirmed by cell line experiments demonstrating that miR-142-3p expression reduced Bach-1 mRNA levels. Furthermore, replacement of miR-142-3p could inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration in breast cancer potentially by targeting of Bach-1 mRNA and subsequent inhibition of CXCR4, MMP9, and VEGFR protein expressions. In addition, induction of miR-142-3p could upregulate tumor suppressor miRNAs, including miR-330, miR-145, and miR34a. Conclusion: For the first time, our results revealed that miR-142-3p could target Bach-1in breast cancer cells leading to the reduction of EMT-related proteins and reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. The results also demonstrated that miR-142-3p could regulate important tumor suppressor miRNAs in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-142-3p could be a good candidate for the targeted therapy of breast cancer, especially for the invasive type. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: We sought to identify patterns of care for patients with appendiceal cancer and identify clinical factors associated with patient selection for multimodality treatment, including cytoreductive surgery and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/PIC). Materials and methods: National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 2004 to 2014 of all diagnoses of appendiceal cancers were examined. We examined treatment modalities, as well as demographic, tumor-specific, and survival data. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the patient cohort most likely to receive CRS/PIC. Kaplan–Meier was used to estimate survival for all treatment groups. Significance was evaluated at P ≤ 0.05. Results: We analyzed data on 18,055 patients. Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-two (55.3%) were treated with surgery only, 5848 (32.4%) received surgery and systemic chemotherapy, 1393 (7.71%) received CRS/PIC, 520 (2.88%) received chemotherapy alone, and 302 (1.67%) received neither surgery nor chemotherapy. Significant predictors of receiving CRS/PIC included male sex (OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.11-1.59), white race (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.40-2.86), non-Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.21-3.05), private insurance (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.26-1.84), and well-differentiated tumors (OR 4.25, CI: 3.39-5.32) (P < 0.05). Treatment with CRS/PIC was associated with a higher 5-year survival for mucinous malignancies, when compared to surgery alone (65.6% versus 62.4%, P < 0.01). Treatment with CRS/PIC was also associated with higher 5-year survival for well-differentiated malignancies, when compared to all other treatment modalities (74.9% versus 65.4%, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Patients were more likely to undergo CRS/PIC if they were male, white, privately insured, and with well-differentiated tumors. CRS/PIC was associated with improved survival in patients with mucinous and low-grade tumors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: In breast cancer patients, post chemotherapy weight gain is linked with increased risk of cancer recurrence. We prospectively studied a cohort of premenopausal women receiving contemporary chemotherapy following a diagnosis of breast cancer to examine factors predicting weight increase. Methods: Between May 2005 and January 2008, 523 patients from the Prospective Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary (POSH) breast cancer study entered this sub-study comparing weight prior to chemotherapy and weight and waist/hip measurements 12-months following chemotherapy. Results: Data from 380 patients were available. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) pre-treatment body mass index (BMI) was 26.3 (5.6) kg/m 2 ; 30% women gained &gt; 5% body weight during the study period. Lower BMI at diagnosis predicted greater subsequent post treatment weight gain (4.3% relative weight gain for those in the 1st quartile of BMI compared to 0.8% for those in the 4th quartile; r = −0.22; p &lt; 0.001). No link to chemotherapy regimens, cigarette smoking, previous parity or chemotherapy induced amenorrhoea was noted. A total of 44% of women had central obesity (post-treatment waist measurement of ≥88 cm). Conclusions: Almost a third of premenopausal patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer will gain clinically significant weight and over 40% will have central obesity 12-months following diagnosis. A greater weight gain is predicted by lower pretreatment BMI. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The present study investigated Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA genotyping in primary tumor, pelvic lymph nodes (PLN) and recurrence in early-stage cervical cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study. From 2003 to 2015, 282 patients underwent surgery for cervical cancer in the Department of Gynecology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. Twenty-nine recurrent cases were identified. HPV DNA genotyping was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from the primary tumor, PLN, and recurrent disease. Results: In the primary tumor, HPV DNA was detectable in 18(72%) of 25 tissue specimens from recurrent cases and in 15(83%) of 18 controls. HPV DNA-positive PLN was significantly associated with recurrence, 83%(95%CI: 52–98%), compared to patients with HPV-negative PLN, 38%(95%CI: 18–62%)(p < 0.05). HPV DNA genotyping was positive in eight of 12(67%) patients with recurrent disease. The genotype was identical in all three tissues types. The positive predictive value for recurrence was the same for detection of HPV-DNA and metastases in the PLN, with reasonable sensitivity. The negative predictive value for recurrence, however, was best for HPV-DNA, 62%(95%CI: 38–98%). Conclusions: In conclusion, our data suggest that the presence of HPV in pelvic lymph nodes is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV)16 can be separated into genetic sub-lineages (A1–4, B1–4, C1–4, D1–4) which may have differential cervical cancer risk. Methods: A next-generation sequencing assay was used to whole-genome sequence 7116 HPV16-positive cervical samples from well-characterised international epidemiological studies, including 2076 controls, 1878 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 186 adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous cell carcinoma (ADC), and to assign HPV16 sub-lineage. Logistic regression was used to estimate region-stratified country-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95%CI. Results: A1 was the most globally widespread sub-lineage, with others showing stronger regional specificity (A3 and A4 for East Asia, B1–4 and C1–4 for Africa, D2 for the Americas, B4, C4 and D4 for North Africa). Increased cancer risks versus A1 were seen for A3, A4 and D (sub)lineages in regions where they were common: A3 in East Asia (OR=2.2, 95%CI:1.0–4.7); A4 in East Asia (6.6, 3.1–14.1) and North America (3.8, 1.7–8.3); and D in North (6.2, 4.1–9.3) and South/Central America (2.2, 0.8–5.7), where D lineages were also more frequent in ADC than SCC (3.2, 1.5–6.5; 12.1, 5.7–25.6, respectively). Conclusions: HPV16 genetic variation can strongly influence cervical cancer risk. However, burden of cervical cancer attributable to different sub-lineages worldwide is largely driven by historical HPV16 sub-lineage dispersal. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third-leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. HACE1 function as a tumor-suppressor gene and is downregulated in several kinds of cancers. However, the distribution and clinical significance of HACE1 in CRC is still not clarified. In this study, we found that the HACE1 expression is greatly downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, the HACE1 expression was significantly associated with inhibition of CRC cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion. HACE1 inhibited epithelial–mesenchymal transition in CRC cells. Furthermore, we found that HACE1 altered the protein expression of the Hippo pathway by downregulation of YAP1. HACE1 suppresses the invasive ability of CRC cells by negatively regulating the YAP1 pathway. Our data indicates that HACE1 directly targets YAP1 and induces downregulation of YAP1, thereby increasing the activity of the Hippo pathway. In summary, these findings demonstrated that HACE1–YAP1 axis had an important part in the CRC development and progression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Few studies evaluated ICU readmission in cancer patients. This study aimed to describe the incidence and risk factors for ICU readmission in cancer patients and the association with mortality. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study at a comprehensive cancer center, which included cancer patients who were discharged after their initial ICU admission over a 5-year period. The characteristics and outcomes of patients who required ICU readmission within 30 days of discharge were compared to those who did not require readmission during the study period. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with readmission and to evaluate the association between readmission and mortality. Results: Among 1582 patients discharged from the ICU, 313(19.8%) were readmitted after a median of 6 days. The most common readmission diagnoses were respiratory failure and sepsis. Mechanical ventilation (OR 5.80; 95% CI 4.29–7.84) and thrombocytopenia (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.16–2.38), on the first ICU admission were associated with readmission. Readmission was associated with a higher risk of 28-day and 90-day mortality, (OR 3.02; CI 2.3–4.00) and (OR 3.47; 95% CI 2.69–4.49), respectively. Conclusions: ICU readmission was associated with increased mortality. Mechanical ventilation and thrombocytopenia at the first admission were associated with ICU readmission. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "This study has evaluated the effect of functionalizing surface charges of hydroxyapatite on the modulation of loading and release of curcumin nanoparticles. The increase in loading and release of curcumin nanoparticles indirectly translates to enhanced anti-cancer effect. Owing to the hydrophobic characteristics of curcumin which have resulted in low bioavailability in cancer cells, the engineering curcumin into nanoparticles is therefore a viable solution to overcomes its limitation. In order to maintain a sustained release profile of curcumin nanoparticles, curcumin nanoparticles were loaded (Cur-NPs) onto hydroxyapatite (HA) via physical adsorption. To regulate the adsorption capacity of Cur-NPs onto HA, we functionalized HA with different carboxylic acids (lactic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid). The presence of carboxylic groups on HA significantly affected the binding and the release profile of Cur-NPs. The effects of Cur-NPs loaded HA were evaluated on breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), which included cell proliferation, cellular uptake of Cur-NPs, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. The results showed that carboxylic acid-functionalized HA demonstrated higher anti-proliferating activity and time dependent cytoplasmic uptake of Cur-NPs in MCF-7 cells compared to unmodified HA. In addition, Cur-NPs loaded on functionalized HA induced higher apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells compared to unmodified HA. The present study indicates that the delivery of Cur-NPs to breast cancer using carboxylic acid-functionalized HA carrier could improve their anti-cancer activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To develop an explanatory model, built on an ecological basis, and examine the relational effects of multilevel factors on screening behaviour among South Asian immigrant women. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, exploratory correlational study using path analysis. 776 South Asian immigrant women were recruited from community in Hong Kong. A self-administered survey with eight sections covering socio-demographics, recommendations received from others, previous screening experience, knowledge of the disease and screening, attitudes and perceptions, level of acculturation, cultural barriers to screening and perception of cancer fatalism was used to collect data. Path analysis was done to test the hypothesised model. Findings: The final model obtained an acceptable model fit with x 2 /df = 2.52, RMSEA = 0.044, CFI = 0.95 and TLI = 0.93. A total of 15 factors, ranging from intra-personal to community level, were identified as being associated with South Asian immigrant women's cervical cancer screening behaviour. Three factors at the community level (language use, modesty and crisis orientation) had an inter-relationship with three intra-personal factors (perceived barriers to screening, cancer fatalism and perceived benefits of screening) and hence affected screening uptake. Conclusions: South Asian women's cervical cancer screening behaviour is affected by multi-level factors. Efforts should be made to change the current health-promoting strategies and attract more involvement from appropriate stakeholders, incorporating cultural and socio-environmental components in future interventions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a disease of glucose metabolism, and it adversely affects bone metabolism and increases the risk of cancer development. Previously, we reported a method for the direct isolation of human mature osteoblasts and indicated that osteoblasts were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus-related signaling pathways. In addition, a recent report suggested that osteoblasts are involved in glucose metabolism. Thus, we sought to examine the effects of diabetes on osteoblast signaling in vivo. We recruited eight patients with type 2 diabetes and eight non-diabetic individuals. We isolated human mature osteoblasts from the resected femoral heads during orthopaedic surgery and extracted their RNA. We compared the gene expression between the two groups by RNA microarray and pathway analyses. Microarray analysis showed significant differences in 885 of 19,463 genes between the two groups (p < 0.05), and pathway analysis revealed that pathways related to cancer and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway were significantly activated in the diabetes group (p < 0.01). These preliminary findings suggest that diabetes affects intracellular signaling in human mature osteoblasts and that osteoblasts might not only play a key role in the regulation of bone and glucose metabolism, but might also be related to cancer metabolism. We plan to conduct further studies to examine signaling in diabetic osteoblasts and to further investigate the genes and pathways identified here. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Many observational studies have reported an association between vitamin D and non-skeletal health outcomes. The D-Health Trial was launched to determine if supplementing the older population with high monthly doses of Vitamin D can prevent cancer and premature mortality. The intervention is ongoing but here we provide a detailed statistical analysis plan for the primary and secondary outcomes of the D-Health Trial. Methods/design: The D-Health Trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Between February 2014 and May 2015, 21,315 people were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive monthly doses of either 60,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3 ) or placebo for five years. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality and the secondary outcomes are total cancer incidence and colorectal cancer incidence. These will be ascertained via linkage to death and cancer registries. The primary analysis for each outcome will follow an intention-to-treat approach; we will use flexible parametric survival models to investigate the association between supplementation and time to an event. We describe in detail sophisticated secondary analyses that consider non-compliance and contamination due to off-study supplementation. Conclusions: Publication of this statistical analysis plan in advance of the intervention's completion, and adherence to it, will avoid data-driven analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes and ensure robust reporting of outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Background: Minimally invasive surgeries are increasingly being performed for primary colon cancer resections since laparoscopic and robotic surgeries have less post-operative pain, shorter length of hospitalization, less morbidity, improved patient satisfaction and equivalent R0 resection rates compared to laparotomy. Methods: To analyze characteristics of patients who developed port site metastases after minimally invasive colectomy, a retrospective case series of a single institution from 2004 to 2017 was performed. The study included patients who had a minimally invasive resection of the primary colon cancer and subsequent cytoreduction and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) for peritoneal metastases. Patient characteristics, histology, pathology, prior treatments, time between surgeries, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and survival were reviewed. Results: There were 123 patients who had CRS/HIPEC and 13 of them had a history of laparoscopic or robotic colectomy followed by the development of port site disease. Four were females, nine were males. Median age was 48 years (range, 19–64). Eleven of 13 primary colon cancers were T3 or T4. Ten of 13 patients had no clinical evidence of peritoneal metastases at the time of initial resection. All 13 patients had metastatic deposits at port sites that were confirmed histopathologically at the time of CRS/HIPEC. Conclusions: Port site metastases were present concomitantly with peritoneal metastases in 13 patients. An advanced T-stage of disease occurred in 85% of patients. Port site metastases do occur after minimally invasive colon resection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy stops or slows down the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Chemotherapy usually uses in combination with, surgery, radiotherapy or other treatments. Therefore, it is useful to calculate the photon interaction parameters to determine the energy accumulation and penetration in tissue due to the interaction of cancer drugs with radiation. In this work, the mass attenuation coefficient (μ/ρ), half value layer (HVL) and effective atomic number (Z eff ) of some cancer drugs (Tadocel, Fluro-5, Erbitux, Carboplatin, Temodal, Tamoxifen, Endoksan and Oxaliplatin) have determined experimentally at 13.81, 17.7, 26.34 and 59.54 keV photons emitted from Am-241-point source by using Si(Li) detector. Besides, we calculated theoretically the gamma-ray interaction parameters using the WinXCOM software program. Next to these, utilizing the GP fitting approach, exposure buildup factors (EBF) of the drugs determined up to 40 mfp in the energy range 0.015–15 MeV. Experimental and theoretical results have been found to be in harmony. Oxaliplatin and Carboplatin have larger μ and Z eff and lower HVL values than the other drugs under study. The smallest EBF values are observed for Endoksan, Oxaliplatin and Carboplatin for all of the penetration depths. Oxaliplatin, carboplatin and endoksan possess significantly good radiation absorbing effect. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this nationwide register-based cohort study, we examined cervical cancer screening participation among immigrants in Denmark by country and region of origin. Furthermore, we assessed whether differences in screening participation between immigrants and Danish-born women were explained by sociodemographic or health-related characteristics, and examined predictors of participation among immigrants. Using high-quality registries, we identified women invited for cervical cancer screening during 2008–2009 and retrieved individual-level data on sociodemographic-, health- and immigration-related characteristics. A total of 610,907 women were followed for up to 2.9 years after screening invitation. We estimated the probability of participation using the Aalen-Johansen estimator and the hazard ratios (HRs) of participation using Cox regression. The probability of participation within follow-up was 74.5% (95% CI, 74.4%–74.6%) in Danish-born women; 61.2% (95% CI, 60.4%–62.1%) in Western immigrants; and 61.3% (95% CI, 60.9%–61.8%) in non-Western immigrants. Participation in immigrants varied by region of origin from 44.3% (95% CI, 41.4%–47.4%) in immigrants from North America, New Zealand and Australia to 67.8% (95% CI, 65.4%–70.3%) in immigrants from South- and Central America. Substantial variation was seen between specific countries of origin. Differences in participation between immigrants and Danish-born women were not explained by sociodemographic or health-related characteristics. Predictors of low participation in immigrants included lower income, unemployment, being unmarried, having a history of schizophrenia or other psychoses, and ≤5 years’ stay in Denmark. In conclusion, cervical cancer screening participation in immigrants varied by region and country of origin, but all immigrant groups had lower participation than Danish-born women. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Mortality of patients treated on the intensive care unit suffering from cancer is high, especially when admitted with an unknown malignancy. Still, anti-tumor therapy in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation is a clinical challenge. Over the last years, successful chemotherapy has been reported, even in critically ill patients with infections and organ failure. In this report, we present a 42-year old male patient who later was been diagnosed for a highly-malignant lymphoma (Burkitt) developed an abdominal compartment syndrome due to ileus, ascites and progressive intestinal tumor manifestation. During the course, he required mechanical ventilation and developed several organ failures including need for renal replacement therapy. After laparotomy the abdomen was left open and managed by a vacuum dressing. The patient received systemic chemotherapy and broad anti-infective treatment in presence of markedly elevated markers of inflammation. Fortunately, he was successfully weaned from vasopressor and respiratory support. By obtaining negative fluid balances closure of the abdomen succeeded 18 days after laparotomy. The patient was transferred to the normal ward without organ dysfunction on day 27 and discharged home after a second cycle of chemotherapy. In conclusion, aggressive treatment using chemotherapy in critically ill patients with initially unkown malignancy may be successful. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) is the most common type of cancer and the second cause of death worldwide in men and women after cardiovascular diseases. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent type of LC occurring in 85% of cases. Developing new methods for early detection of NSCLC could substantially increase the chances of survival and, therefore, is an urgent task for current research. Nowadays, explosion in nanotechnology offers unprecedented opportunities for therapeutics and diagnosis applications. In this context, exploiting the bio-nano-interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and biological fluids is an emerging field of research. Upon contact with biofluids, NPs are covered by a biomolecular coating referred to as “biomolecular corona” (BC). In this study, we exploited BC for discriminating between NSCLC patients and healthy volunteers. Blood samples from 10 NSCLC patients and 5 subjects without malignancy were allowed to interact with negatively charged lipid NPs, leading to the formation of a BC at the NP surface. After isolation, BCs were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). We found that the BCs of NSCLC patients was significantly different from that of healthy individuals. Statistical analysis of SDS-PAGE results allowed discriminating between NSCLC cancer patients and healthy subjects with 80% specificity, 80% sensitivity and a total discriminate correctness rate of 80%. While the results of the present investigation cannot be conclusive due to the small size of the data set, we have shown that exploitation of the BC is a promising approach for the early diagnosis of NSCLC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Resistin, secreted by macrophages in tumor microenvironment, has never been investigated in pancreatic cancer models, despite a vibrant tumor microenvironment around pancreatic tumors. We evaluated serum resistin levels in healthy individuals versus pancreatic cancer patients representing different tumor grades. In vitro mechanistic analysis involved MiaPaCa-2 and SW1990 cells. Resistin signaling depends on binding of resistin to its cognitive receptors. Therefore, we silenced adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), its two known receptors, individually as well as in combination, by short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Effect of resistin on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and sensitivity to gemcitabine was studied without or with silencing of resistin receptors CAP1 and/or TLR4. The results were also confirmed in vivo in mice xenografted with MiaPaCa-2 cells without or with receptor silencing. We report high resistin levels in pancreatic cancer patients which correlate positively with tumor grades. We observed a marked reduction in the resistin-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2 and SW1990 when the receptors were silenced. The results were confirmed in vivo wherein resistin effects were significantly attenuated in MiaPaCa-2 xenografts with silenced receptors. The combined silencing of CAP1 and TLR4 was found to be most effective in vitro and in vivo. We found activation of STAT3 by resistin in vivo and in vitro which was dependent on the presence of CAP1 and TLR4. Further, resistin was found to induce resistance to gemcitabine through its receptors. Our results describe novel functional roles of resistin with implications toward a better understanding of pancreatic tumor microenvironment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid identification of living cancer cells is highly crucial for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. However, it is a great challenge to develop an effective way for rapid identification and imaging of cancer cells in a living state. Moreover, synthesis of monodisperse nanoparticles (NPs) with high sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity is also a tough work. Herein, we creatively reported a convenient method to synthesize the novel NPs as the substrate of SERS sensors, which possessed a gold nanobipyramid core and silver nanorod shell. These gold nanobipyramid core and silver nanorod shell NPs (Au NBP@Ag NRs) were further modified with 4-mercaptobenzoicacid (4-MBA, Raman reporter molecule) and then conjugated with reduced bovine serum albumin (rBSA) and folic acid (FA) on their surfaces, to finally acquire Au NBP@Ag NR-MBA-rBSA-FA nanoprobes. In this system, With the enhancement factor (EF) of Au NBP@Ag NRs was about 4 × 10 7 , it could significantly enhance Raman signal for Raman reporter molecules, and 4-MBA molecules performed high SERS signals based on their structures; the nanoprobes have favorable specificity and biocompatibility owing to the modification of rBSA which effectively avoided the nonspecific attachment of non-targeted cells. Moreover, the obtained SERS nanoprobes have excellent sensitivity for gastric cancer cells (MGC-803 cells) due to the conjugation of folic acid. Thus, the finally obtained Au NBP@Ag NR-MBA-rBSA-FA nanoprobes possess excellent detection efficiency for living MGC-803 cells. Therefore, our synthesized nanoprobes exhibit ultrasensitive SERS-activity, excellent specificity and superior cancer cells targeting ability, which could be applied for rapid identification and Raman imaging of living cancer cells via the SERS signal detection of the nanoprobes. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "ZC3H13 is a canonical CCCH zinc finger protein, which harbors a somatic frame-shift mutation in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, its expression and biological function were still uncertain. In the current study, we found that ZC3H13 was served as a tumor suppressor in CRC cells, which decreased the expression of Snail, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E1, and increased the expression of Occludin and Zo-1 through inactivating Ras–ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, reduction of ZC3H13 associated with advanced TNM stage (p = 0.02), positive regional lymph node metastasis (p = 0.01). Taken together, the current study indicated that ZC3H13 may be an upstream regulator of Ras–ERK signaling pathway and suppressed invasion and proliferation of CRC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "An ecofriendly and efficient method (photoinduced) has been used for green synthesis of stable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using aqueous extract as a reducing and stabilizing agent, derived from halotolerant microalga Dunaliella salina. Synthesis of AuNPs was confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy showing sharp SPR band at 560 nm after 30 min exposure of sunlight. The synthesis was optimized further as exposure(75min) to sunlight, aqueous extract of Dunaliella (AED) inoculum dose(30%) and HAuCl 4 .xH 2 O (1 mM). The presence of nearly spherical shape of AuNPs with average size of 22.4 nm and crystalline nature were confirmed by TEM, SAED and XRD analysis. The XPS analysis of AuNPs showed presence of two individual peaks at 85.17 and 88.94eV that attributed to Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 respectively. Phycochemical analysis of AED demonstrated presence of phenolics, flavonoids, tannin and proteins. AED when subjected to SDS-PAGE showed protein bands of 92 and 66 KDa. AuNPs were tested for anticancer activity on MCF7 (cancer) and MCF 10A (normal) cell lines, keeping commercial drug cisplatin as positive control. AuNPs selectively killed cancer cells and were not detrimental to the normal cell line whereas cisplatin killed normal cells also at 48 h exposure, therefore, such AuNPs may be used as an anticancer agent. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "As one of the most aggressive malignancies, cervical cancer (CC) which mainly affects females has high risks of relapse and death. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-552M11.4 is verified to promote the progression of ovarian cancer; nevertheless, its role and the probable molecular mechanisms in CC remain unclear until the present study. Herein, we unveiled that the expression of lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 tested by qRT-PCR was enhanced in tumor tissues compared with the para-carcinoma tissues and related to FIGO Stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and distant metastasis in CC. Additionally, CC patients with high lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 level suffered from poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, silenced lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 restrained cell proliferation, migration and invasion in CC cells. Subsequently, the mechanistic studies revealed that lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 functioned as a ceRNA of ATF1 in CC by acting as the endogenous sponge for miR-3941, which was identified as a tumor suppressor in CC. Moreover, both miR-3941 inhibition and ATF1 overexpression restored the impacts of inhibited lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 on cellular processes in CC cells. Our observations elucidated the carcinogenic role of lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 in CC was mediated through miR-3941/ATF1 axis, giving a new insight into the effective target for the treatment and prognosis of cervical cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cigar smoking causes many of the same health conditions as cigarettes, but less information is available on prevalence of use trends and the disease burden of cigar smoking in the US. To examine these issues, we analyzed cigar use and health condition data from the National Health Interview Survey from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, estimating prevalence of use by year and over time. We also estimated the number of, and adjusted disease prevalence ratios for, US adults aged ≥35 years with self-reported history of heart disease, stroke, or cancer attributable to cigar smoking. We found that prevalence of current cigar smoking has remained generally stable at around 2.3% among US adults aged ≥18 years between 2000 and 2015 but has increased among female and non-Hispanic black adults. Former exclusive cigar smokers were more likely to report having had heart conditions (aPR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03–1.72), stroke (aPR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.57–3.75), and cancer (aPR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.09–1.88) than never cigar smokers. It is estimated that nearly 200,000 cardiovascular conditions and cancer cases among US adults are attributable to former exclusive cigar smoking. This analysis shows that prevalence of current cigar smoking has remained stable among US adults but has increased among certain demographic groups. Former exclusive cigar use is associated with increased prevalence of heart disease, stroke, and cancer, which may result in part from smoking cessation following disease onset. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Monitoring the polarity of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) is of great importance toward cancer diagnosis. Herein, we have rationally designed a novel LDs-targeting and polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe CBMC, which contains carbazole as an electron-donating group and malononitrile as an electron-accepting group forming intramolecular charge transfer mechanism. Due to its excellent solvatochromism, the probe emits stronger fluorescence in normal cells but weaker in cancer cells. By means of CBMC, normal tissues with stronger fluorescence have been obviously pointed out from cancerous tissues. For cancer therapy, the probe CBMC could be an ideal candidate to evaluate tumor, because the tumor area would decrease while the normal tissue area would increase with treatment time. Compared with existing probes with turn-off signal to normal cells, such a new probe with turn on type in normal cells could provide more reliable information with advantages of lower background interference, higher signal to noise ratio, and higher sensitivity. This probe CBMC will be a powerful tool to be potentially applied in tumor diagnosis in the case of treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Black phosphorus (BP) is a promising theranostic agent owing to its excellent photothermal property, biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, the rapid degradation of BP with oxygen and moisture causes the innate instability that is the Achilles’ heel of BP, hindering its further applications in cancer theranostics. Herein, a facile surface passivation strategy was developed to prepare polydopamine (PDA) coated BP quantum dots (QDs) (denoted as BP@PDA) through self-polymerization method. PDA with enriched phenol groups plays as a scavenger of reactive oxygen, which can efficiently prevent the oxidation of BP quantum dots and make them much stable in water (∼90% for BP@PDA vs. only 10% for pure BP QDs after 10 days storage). Furthermore, PDA with strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption could greatly improve the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of BP QDs from 22.6% to 64.2% (∼2.84-fold higher). Considering the excellent biodegradability and good biocompability of both BP QDs and PDA, the as-prepared BP@PDA hold great potential for cancer theranostics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, we have determined the prognostic value and observed the clinicopathological features of brainstem glioma. Overall, we found more number of male patients with brainstem glioma (male:female ratio: 1:6). All patients were subjected to surgery followed by chemotherapy. The tumor was mainly located at brainstem and thalamus. We have recorded the symptoms associated with onset of lesions and predominated by headache, vomiting and limb weakness. We observed the overall survival pattern in brain stem glioma cases and further among low and high grade subgroups. Patients with high grade brainstem glioma were recorded with the median survival of 15 months. There was a statistically significant difference in the survival pattern of low grade vs high grade group (p = 0.015, hazard ratio: 0.29, 95% CI of ratio: 0.058 to 0.71) Taken together, the clinical presentation provides valuable information to enhance the therapeutic measures for the brainstem glioma cases. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Data from 423 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−), hormone receptor-positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer (aBC) patients treated with palbociclib and endocrine therapy (ET) were provided by 35 Italian cancer centers and analyzed for treatment outcomes. Overall, 158 patients were treated in first line and 265 in second/later lines. We observed 19 complete responses and 112 partial responses. The overall response rate (ORR) was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.6–35.4) and clinical benefit was 52.7% (95% CI, 48–57.5). ORR was negatively affected by prior exposure to everolimus/exemestane (p = 0.002) and favorably influenced by early line-treatment (p < 0.0001). At 6 months, median progression-free survival was 12 months (95% CI, 8–16) and median overall survival was 24 months (95% CI, 17–30). More favorable outcomes were associated with palbociclib in early lines, no visceral metastases and no prior everolimus/exemestane. The main toxicity reported was neutropenia. Our results provide further support to the use of palbociclib with ET in HER2−, HR+ aBC. Differences in outcomes across patients subsets remain largely unexplained. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Heparosan polysaccharide, known as a heparin precursor, can be used in drug delivery systems due to its good biocompatibility and anti-cancer effect. But few studies on the cellular uptake mechanism of heparosan polysaccharide-based nanocarrier have been investigated. Therefore, the intracellular trafficking and the uptake mechanism of heparosan-based micelles by different tumor cells were investigated in this study. Heparosan-cholesterol amphipathic conjugates (KC) were constructed and doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded to prepare DOX/KC micelles. Different cancer cells were selected to find out the influence on DOX/KC uptake. There was an obvious difference in cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of DOX/KC in various cancer cells. Interestingly, DOX/KC micelles exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity against MGC80-3 cells and displayed highly cellular uptake by B16 cells. The results of the uptake mechanism showed that the internalization of DOX/KC micelles into MGC80-3 cells and A549 cells was mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, while micropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin/caveolae -independent multi-pathways all contributed to the uptake of micelles in B16 cells. Furthermore, after being internalized by MGC80-3 cells, DOX/KC could escape from the lysosome and simultaneously be transported into the nucleus and mitochondria resulting in the greatest cytotoxicity. These results indicate that heparosan-based drug delivery systems may have different uptake and subcellular distribution behavior in tumor cells, and they will achieve the maximum efficacy only in specific kind of cancers. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Porphyrins are widely used in anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, low physiological solubility and lack of selectivity towards cancer cells are the main limitations of their clinical use. Nanoparticles are being intensively explored as photosensitizer carriers for PDT to overcome these limitations. The aims of this work are to synthesize core-shell hybrid nanoparticles formed by a silica core and xylan carrying a 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin (TPPOH) shell, and evaluate their anticancer activity. To afford drug-controlled incorporation and enhance blood circulation, TPPOH was covalently linked to xylan. Different xylans with degrees of substitution in TPPOH ranging from 0.034 to 1.11, were obtained and characterized. Then, the xylan-TPPOH conjugate (PX) was used to coat the silica nanoparticles (PX SNPs). The obtained nano-objects were characterized and their therapeutic potential for photodynamic therapy evaluated against colorectal cancer cell lines. in vitro analysis showed that PX SNPs were 40-fold and 10-fold more effective against HCT116 cells and HT-29 cells respectively compared to free TPPOH. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Nanostructured capacitive biosensors, combined with inexpensive fabrication technologies, may provide simple, sensitive devices for detecting clinically relevant cancer biomarkers. Herein, we report a novel platform for detecting the pancreatic cancer biomarker CA19-9 using low-cost screen-printed interdigitated electrodes (SPIDEs). The SPIDEs were modified by carbon nano-onions (CNOs) and graphene oxide (GO) films, on which a layer of anti-CA19-9 antibodies was immobilized. The modification with CNOs and GO significantly improved the analytical performance of the biosensor, which displayed superior results to those prepared only with GO. The biossensor exhibited high reproducibility and a relatively low limit of detection of 0.12 U mL −1 . Using these devices in combination with information visualization methods we were able to detect CA19-9 in whole cell lysates of colorectal adenocarcinoma. The fabrication of these low-cost, disposable immunosensors is a successful attempt to explore CNOs in capacitive biosensors, which may be extended for detection of different cancer biomarkers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Circular RNAs were recently identified as a novel type of noncoding RNAs. An increasing number of reports have demonstrated their essential regulatory roles in various biological processes and human diseases, including cancer. However, the role of circRNA in cervical cancer (CC) remains largely unknown. In the current study, we investigated the physiological functions of circ_0067934 during CC development and progression. We found that circ_0067934 was overexpressed in CC tissues and cell lines. Circ_0067934 upregulation was associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in CC patients. Knockdown of circ_0067934 suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of CC cells in vitro. Circ_0067934 loss also inhibited CC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, silencing circ_0067934 increased miR-545 expression. MiR-545 repressed EIF3C expression through targeting its 3′-untranslated region. MiR-545 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells, whereas restoration of EIF3C could rescue the effects of circ_0067934 knockdown. Taken together, our findings revealed that circ_0067934 promotes CC progression via miR-545/EIF3C axis. Our study may provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of CC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "With recent guidelines emphasizing patient values, patient preferences and shared decision-making in regards to prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening it is important for primary care providers and urologists to identify factors that influence men's decisions to undergo PSA screening. We sought to evaluate the impact of men's perceptions of healthcare quality on obtaining a screening PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer. A retrospective secondary data analysis was conducted of men ages 55–69 without a history of prostate cancer using 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. The relationship between Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) questions captured in MEPS and PSA screening in the last two years were assessed using multiple logistic regression. The analysis was carried out in October 2018 at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The final survey sample consisted of 1249 men that equated to 15,313,605.5 once weighted; 69.5% underwent PSA screening. Men who were offered help with filling out forms in the office (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.14–3.01) or rated the quality of healthcare from their doctors ≥7 (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.10–2.44) on a scale from 0 (worst healthcare) to 10 (best health care) had significantly greater adjusted odds of undergoing PSA screening. Men who rated the quality of healthcare delivered to them as high had significantly greater odds of undergoing PSA screening compared to those who rated it lower. Our results may suggest that improvements in healthcare quality and patient experience of care have the potential to positively influence PSA screening. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: There is a paucity of studies reporting long-term survival outcomes for HPV/p16 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). This study aims to compare long-term outcomes of advanced stage p16 positive and negative OPSCCs, treated by surgical and non-surgical modalities. Methods: OPSCC patients from 1998 to 2012 were identified through a prospectively collected cancer registry. P16 immunohistochemistry was used as a surrogate marker for HPV-OPSCC. Overall survival (OS) and aspiration free survival (AFS) comparisons were made between patients treated with chemoradiation (CRT) versus primary surgery and radiation/chemoradiation (S+RT/CRT) at 5, 10 and 15 years post-treatment. Results: A total of 319 patients were included. P16 positive patients and non-smokers had significantly higher long-term (5, 10 and 15-year) OS. Smokers and p16 negative patients treated with S+RT/CRT had improved long-term OS compared to patients who received CRT. Smokers and p16 negative patients had lower long-term AFS. Multivariate analysis showed improved OS was associated with p16 positivity (HR 0.42, 0.28–0.61) and surgery (HR 0.47, 0.32–0.69), whereas lower OS was associated with ECOG ≥ 2 (HR 2.46, 1.61–3.77), smoking (HR 2.37, 1.41–3.99) and higher stage (HR 1.68, 1.05–2.68). Conclusions: In smokers and p16-negative OPSCC patients, primary surgery may be associated with improved long-term survival and dysphagia-related outcomes. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent type of cancer in men. Hypericum perforatum (H. Perforatum) extract (HPE) administration provides remarkable decrease of PCa development. H. perforatum contains 7 conserved miRNAs (Hyp-miR-156a, Hyp-miR-156b, Hyp-miR-166, Hyp-miR-390, Hyp-miR-394, Hyp-miR-396 and Hyp-miR-414) with different targets. In this study, we aimed to investigate cross-kingdom gene regulation via miRNAs of H. perforatum flower dietetically absorbed in manner of an in silico approach to define potential biomarkers for PCa. psRNATarget database was used to find human genes targeted by 7 pre-defined H. perforatum miRNAs. We defined the mostly affected gene families from these miRNAs as ZNF, TMEM, SLC and FAM gene families. GeneMANIA database was used to define the most affected genes (TMEM41B and SLC4A7) from these 7 miRNAs. cBioPortal database was used to define alteration frequencies of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 on different types of PCa and to measure the mutual interaction potency and significance of co-occurence in PCa. This analysis showed that neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) had the highest total mutation frequency (22%) of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes. Also, TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes had an average 2.1% pathway change potential among all different types of PCa. Moreover, TMEM41B and SLC4A7 gene pair was found significantly co-occurrent in PCa (p &lt; 0.001). Finally, via GEPIA database, we used Spearman correlation analysis to measure the correlation degree of TMEM41B and SLC4A7 genes in PCa and found their significant correlation with PCa (p = 1.2 × 10 −12 , R = 0.28). All in all, it was proved in silico and supported with previously known clinical data that SLC4A7 and TMEM41B potentially have a significant and critical tumor suppressive role for PCa, and show this effect combinatorily working together. This is the first study correlating SLC4A7 and TMEM41B with PCa significantly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Radon is a radioactive gas permanently produced in rocks, soils, building materials as an indirect decay product of uranium and thorium. According to EPA, radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking. The aim of survey was to measure radon levels and ambient gamma dose rates in dwellings in various types of buildings situated on various ground and to evaluate health parameters depended on indoor radiation such as lung cancer risk and total annual effective dose rate. Moreover, we wanted to verify the possibility to predict indoor radon concentration in specific dwelling knowing types of soil, building construction, building materials and floor number. The measurements of radon concentrations were carried out using SSNTDs Kodak LR-115 which were exchanged seasonally. The ambient gamma dose rates were measured using Geiger counter. Radon concentrations in all dwellings were lower than 300 Bq m −3 (recommended by EU action level). In some dwellings during some seasons radon concentrations were above 100 Bq m −3 . Prolonged exposure to indoor radon at the levels of 100 Bq m −3 causes statistically significant increase of lung cancer. The average indoor radon concentration in Wroclaw's dwellings was 46 Bq m −3 . The annual risk of lung cancer was lower than 0.0005%. The total annual effective dose rates ranged from 1.36 mSv y −1 to 3.3 mSv y −1 . We observed seasonal, vertical, spatial variations of radon concentrations. We did not notice significant drop of ambient gamma dose rates between the ground floor and floors 2nd to 5th as we did for radon concentrations. We noticed that indoor radon concentrations differed 4 to 6 times even among dwellings located in these same types of buildings, on these same soil types or these same floors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Metal nanoparticles synthesis using plant extract is one of the most attractive and ecofriendly methods. In the present report, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized using Lonicera japonica flower-extract for in vitro anticancer activity against cervical cancer. The formation of AuNPs were indicated by color changes (light-yellow to ruby-red), and confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy (absorbance ∼530–580 nm). The synthesized AuNPs size about 10–40 nm with mostly spherical and few triangular, and hexagonal shapes. Elemental composition and crystalline nature were confirmed by EDX and XRD, respectively. FTIR studies revealed the presence of plant materials on the surface of AuNPs, which could be responsible for formation of AuNPs. GC-MS analysis was utilized to determine the phytochemical composition of L. japonica flowers. The synthesized AuNPs were checked for the cytotoxic effect on normal embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and cervix cancer (HeLa) cells. In conclusion, the normal cells were remaining unharmed while cancer cells growth inhibition was observed dose dependent. From immunofluorescent staining studies of HeLa cells, condensation and fragmentation of nuclear material were observed that indicates apoptotic cell death. These results clearly suggested that eco-friendly synthesis of AuNPs using flower-extract of L. japonica could be used to treat cervical cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Potential anti-cancer drugs are frequently of low efficacy in clinics due to the lack of predictive models or the insufficient employment of existing preclinical test systems. Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro engineered tumor models can better predict the efficacy of novel drugs by reproducing the in vivo tumor microenvironment. In this study, three sources of scaffolds (decellularized lung scaffold, chitosan/gelatin scaffold, and poly-L-lactic acid scaffold) incorporated with breast cancer cells (MCF-7, 4T1) were bioengineered as a platform to study in vitro solid tumor development. The good biocompatibility of three scaffolds favored cell growth and proliferation. Cells in 3D scaffolds were less sensitive to chemotherapy and exhibited characteristics of higher malignancy compared to their 2D counterparts. The expression of breast cancer biomarkers in MCF-7 cells markedly up-regulated in 3D scaffolds in comparison with those in 2D cultures. Cells grown in 3D scaffolds were found to be more tumorigenic and angiogenic in BABL/c mice xenografts than cells grown from monolayers. The results demonstrate that 3D engineered tumor model can better mimic in vivo tumor and can serve as a more appropriate platform for the study and screening of novel cancer therapeutics. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Nanotechnology-based bitherapy has recently emerged as an effective strategy to overcome biomedical barriers against successful anticancer therapy. The study aimed to evaluate lipid nanocarriers loaded with tamoxifen citrate/coenzyme Q10 (TC/CoQ10) as bitherapy for selective targeting of breast cancer. Based on a previous study, four formulations of lipid nanocarriers were selected for in-vitro cell viability estimation using both MCF-7 and normal WISH cell lines. Oxidative status, cytopathological changes, and genetoxicity were also investigated. The results showed 100% mortality for tested cells without selectivity even at very low concentration for free drugs. On the other hand lipid nanocarriers revealed an increase in % cell viability for normal WISH cell line reaching 100% at 0.25 μg/ml. The lipid nanocarrier formulated from stearic acid and lecithin showed LC 50 on MCF-7 cell line (1.6 μg/ml) compared to (4.8 μg/ml) on WISH cell line. The cell death pathway for unformulated bitherapy depended on necrosis rather than apoptosis. The Malondialdehyde concentration was decreased, while Glutathione level increased to near normal values in both MCF-7 and WISH cells. The results demonstrated a promising synergistic and selective action of TC/CoQ10 bitherapy on breast cancer cells when administered in lipid nanocarriers delivery system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, a new approach to directly synthesize drug molecule imbedded in the nanometer sized polymer particles is reported. Molecular imprinting is used to prepare polymers for drug specific for selectively loading of a desired drug. Computer simulations were performed to provide mechanistic insights on the binding modalities of model cancer drug, amygdalin with the polymer precursors. Controlled release of amygdalin from nanoMIPs was studied in vitro cell test and monitoring the absorbance at λ em of 390 nm by fluorescence. The nanoparticles imprinted with amygdalin (nanoMIPs) showed high drug loading (0.98 mg g −1 ) and also releases drug in a controlled way without burst release. The polymer releases amygdalin 0.095 μg (5 min), 0.120 μg (30 min), 0.180 μg (180 min), 0.205 μg in 300 min in de-ionized water and similar pattern of release was observed in buffer 2 and 7. The sustained release of drug from nanoMIPs follows Fickian diffusion; and uniformity in nanoMIPs size have significant impact on release of drug. Swelling of nanoMIP is one of the dominant factors influencing the drug release patterns. The imprinting procedure and the studies reported in this study would be highly useful in future for cancer drug administration. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered to be the third most common cancer worldwide, and it is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths. CRC is described as multifactorial disease. Among others, Glutathione S-transferases are known to act pro-carcinogenic in CRCs, however, they are needed for the conjugation between chemotherapeutics and a wide spectrum of xenobiotics. In this study, 70 patients with CRC and 85 healthy volunteers without any cancer history were genotyped. Polymorphism genotypes for the genes GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTM1 were studied by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and/or multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Our finding showed a significant risk for CRC associated with GSTP1 heterozygous Ile/Val (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 0.93–3.44; p = 0.009), while GSTP1 Val/Val homozygous was observed only in the CRC patients. Significant differences in the frequency of GSTM1- and GSTT1-null genotypes were found. The GSTT1-null genotype was higher in CRC group (34.3%) than in control group (12.9%) (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.57–7.83; p = 0.001). The GSTM1-null was higher in CRC cases (42.8%) compared with control group (21.1%) (OR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.38–5.64; p = 0.003). Individuals carrying combined, both GSTM1/GSTT1-null genotype, were associated with an estimated 7.56-fold higher risk to form CRC than those having GSTM1/GSTT1-present genotype. Individuals carrying combined three genotypes of GSTM1-null/GSTT1-null/ heterozygous Ile/Val genotype for GSTP1 were associated with an estimated 21.63-fold higher risk to be CRC than those carrying GSTM1-present/GSTT1-present/ Ile/Ile genotype of the GSTP1 (OR = 21.63; 95% CI: 2.39–195.82; p = 0.001). Also, individuals with combined three genotypes of GSTM1-null/GSTT1-present/ heterozygous Ile/Val genotype for GSTP1 were associated with an estimated 13.9-fold higher risk to be CRC than those carrying GSTM1-present/GSTT1-present/ Ile/Ile genotype of the GSTP1 (OR = 13.9; 95% CI: 2.60–74.35; p = 0.0007). Overall, the results of this pilot study in 70 patients revealed that the GSTM1-null genotype, alone or in combination with GSTT1-null genotype, GSTP1-heterozygous is associated with enhanced risk for CRC in Syrian population. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Short interfering RNA (siRNA) showed to be a viable alternative to a better prognosis in cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the successful application of this strategy still depends on the development of nanocarriers for the safe delivery of siRNA into the diseased tissue, which mostly occurs by passive accumulation. When an external magnetic field is applied, magnetic nanoparticles biodistribution is partially modulated to favor accumulation in a target tissue. In this work we designed a novel magnetic responsive siRNA nanocarrier. The new delivery system is composed of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with calcium phosphate (CaP) and PEG-polyanion block copolymers, which are known to be biocompatible. The nanoparticles presented rounded shape with small size and narrow distribution suitable for biomedical applications. TEM images showed dark spheres in the core surrounded by a lower electron density material in the corona. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) confirmed CaP-polymer coating of the magnetic core. In addition, the coating procedure did not affect the superparamagnetic property as showed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). With a high loading efficiency (80%), the nanoparticles enhanced vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) silencing in breast cancer cells in vitro, at gene and protein levels (~60% and 40%, respectively), without associated toxicity. Iron and siRNA quantification showed that the novel nanoparticles move towards a magnetic source carrying siRNA molecules. Therefore, these novel nanoparticles are a promising tool for cancer therapy based on RNAi effect, added by a magnetic capability to further modulate siRNA accumulation in the target tissue. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
