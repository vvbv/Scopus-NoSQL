    "Abstract": "Aims Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy that affects adolescents. Although great attention has been paid to the diagnosis of and therapy for OS, the 5-year survival rate of patients with this disease remains poor. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in pathogenesis and progression of human malignancies. MiR-139 has been implicated in several human cancers. However, the role played by miR-139 in pathogenesis of human OS has remained largely unknown. Main methods Realtime PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-139. CCK-8, BrdU-ELISA and ApoTox-Glo™ Triplex assay was employed to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. Realtime PCR, Western Blotting and luciferase report assays were conducted for the target genes analysis. Key findings The expression of miR-139 was reduced while the expression of forkhead-box P2 (FOXP2) was induced in both OS tissue and cell lines. The reduced level of miR-139 was correlated with tumor size, clinical stage and distant metastasis. Overexpression of miR-139 inhibited the expression of FOXP2, which suppressed cell growth, but induced apoptosis. Further, we confirmed that FOXP2 was a direct target of miR-139 by luciferase reporter assay. Knockdown of FOXP2 resulted in reduced levels of cell proliferation, but increased levels of apoptosis in vitro. Significance These findings suggest that miR-139 plays a suppressive role in the regulation of OS cell proliferation and migration via directly targeting FOXP2, which might be a potential clinical diagnostic or predictive biomarker for human OS. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal types of tumor amongst all human cancers due to late diagnosis and resistant to treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. Preclinical and clinical studies have revealed that ErbB family for example epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a validated molecular target for pancreatic cancer prevention and therapy. The ErbB signaling cascade is regulated by a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, namely ADAM17, by enzymatic cleavage of precursor ligands into soluble cytokines and growth factors. Mouse genetic studies have demonstrated that ADAM17 is required for PDAC development. In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor effects of A9(B8) IgG – the first specific ‘human and mouse cross-reactive’ ADAM17 inhibitory antibody on pancreatic malignant transformation. We found that inhibition of ADAM17 with A9(B8) IgG efficiently suppressed the shedding of ADAM17 substrates both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that administration of A9(B8) IgG significantly suppressed motility in human pancreatic cancer cells and also significantly delayed tumorigenesis in the Pdx1Cre;KrasG12D;Trp53fl/+ PDAC mouse model. Inhibition of ADAM17 with A9(B8) IgG particularly affected the progression of pre-invasive pancreatic lesions to advanced PDAC in mice. Taken together, the preclinical data presented here will provide a starting point for clinical applications of ADAM17 targeted therapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic significance of lingual flange protrusion for liver metastasis of patients with malignant neoplasia. METHODS: The data of 191 patients with malignant neoplasia were analyzed. All photos of patients' tongue image were recorded and lingual flange protrusion was the positive standard. χ2 test for paired data and Kappa test were used to determine the diagnostic value of lingual flange protrusion for metastatic liver cancer. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the levels of liver serological markers. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and logistic regression model were used to analyze the predictive values of lingual flange protrusion, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. RESULTS: Patients with lingual flange protrusion had a higher risk of liver metastasis than those without it (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in diagnosis of liver metastasis between lingual flange protrusion and traditional diagnostic criteria (P = 0.541). Kappa was 0.738 (P &lt; 0.001). Lingual flange protrusion was significantly correlated with increased serum ALP and LDH levels (P &lt; 0.01). Comparison of ROC curves showed that the diagnostic value of lingual flange protrusion is better than ALP, LDH and the combination of ALP and LDH (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the combined diagnostic values of lingual flange protrusion and ALP, lingual flange protrusion and LDH, and lingual flange protrusion, ALP and LDH are not better than lingual flange protrusion alone (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lingual flange protrusion is a potential diagnostic marker for liver metastasis of patients with malignant neoplasia. © 2017 JTCM. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Although the globulin-to-albumin ratio (GAR) is useful for prognostication of patients with various cancers, its relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The study aims to investigate the relationship between GAR and postoperative survival among patients with HCC undergoing potentially curative liver resection (LR). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 368 patients with newly diagnosed HCC who underwent initial and potentially curative LR. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model were performed to detect clinical characteristics that correlated with overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to compare OS and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The result of multivariate analysis using 25 clinical characteristics selected by univariate analysis revealed that the GAR (≥0.918/&lt;0.918) was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.398; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.012-5.683; P = 0.047), as well as platelet count (&lt;14/≥14, ×10 4 /mm 3 ) and portal vein invasion (presence/absence). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test demonstrated that the OS and DFS of patients with a high GAR (&gt;0.918) were significantly worse than that of patients with a low GAR (≤0.918). Conclusions: The GAR is a useful predictor of postoperative survival among patients with HCC undergoing potentially curative LR. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To assess the role in predicting nipple-areola complex (NAC) involvement of a newly developed automatic method which computes the 3D tumor-NAC distance. Patients and Methods: Ninety-nine patients scheduled to nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) examination at 1.5 T, including sagittal T2w and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MR imaging. An automatic method was developed to segment the NAC and the tumor and to compute the 3D distance between them. The automatic measurement was compared with manual axial and sagittal 2D measurements. NAC involvement was defined by the presence of invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma and/or ductal carcinoma in situ or ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN1c − DIN3). Results: Tumor-NAC distance was computed on 95/99 patients (25 NAC+), as three tumors were not correctly segmented (sensitivity = 97%), and 1 NAC was not detected (sensitivity = 99%). The automatic 3D distance reached the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.830) with respect to the manual axial (0.676), sagittal (0.664), and minimum distances (0.664). At the best cut-off point of 21 mm, the 3D distance obtained sensitivity = 72%, specificity = 80%, positive predictive value = 56%, and negative predictive value = 89%. Conclusions: This method could provide a reproducible biomarker to preoperatively select breast cancer patients candidates to NSM, thus helping surgical planning and intraoperative management of patients. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Recent genomic studies have identified subtypes of uterine leiomyoma (LM) with distinctive genetic alterations. Here, we report the elucidation of the biological characteristics of the two most prevalent uterine leiomyoma subtypes, MED12-mutant (MED12-LM) and HMGA2-overexpressing (HMGA2-LM) uterine leiomyomas. Because each tumor carries only one genetic alteration, both subtypes are considered to be monoclonal. Approximately 90% of cells in HMGA2-uterine leiomyoma were smooth muscle cells (SMC) with HMGA2 overexpression. In contrast, MED12-LM consisted of similar numbers of SMC and non-SMC, which were mostly tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF). Paradoxically, TAF carried no mutations in MED12, suggesting an interaction between SMC and TAF to coordinate their growth. The higher amount of extracellular matrix in MED12-LM than HMGA2-LM was partially due to the high concentration of collagen-producing TAF. SMC growth in a xenograft assay was driven by progesterone in both uterine leiomyoma subtypes. In contrast, TAF in MED12-LM proliferated in response to estradiol, whereas progesterone had no effect. The high concentration of estrogen-responsive TAF in MED12-LM explains the inconsistent discoveries between in vivo and in vitro studies on the mitogenic effect of estrogen and raises questions regarding the accuracy of previous studies utilizing MED12-LM cell culture. In addition, the differential effects of estradiol and progesterone on these uterine leiomyoma subtypes emphasize the importance of subtypes and genotypes in designing nonsurgical therapeutic strategies for uterine leiomyoma. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint therapies target tumor antigen-specific T cells, but less is known about their effects on natural killer (NK) cells, which help control metastasis. In studying the development of lung metastases, we found that NK cells lose their cytotoxic capacity and acquire a molecular signature defined by the expression of coinhibitory receptors. In an effort to overcome this suppressive mechanism, we evaluated NK cell responses to the immunostimulatory cytokine IL12. Exposure to IL12 rescued the cytotoxicity of NK cells but also led to the emergence of an immature NK cell population that expressed high levels of the coinhibitory molecules PD-1, Lag-3, and TIGIT, thereby limiting NK cell-mediated control of pulmonary metastases. Notably, checkpoint blockade therapy synergized with IL12 to fully enable tumor control by NK cells, demonstrating that checkpoint blockers are not only applicable to enhance T cell-mediated immunotherapy, but also to restore the tumor-suppressive capacity of NK cells. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Current challenges to melanoma therapy include the adverse effects from immunobiologics, resistance to drugs targeting the MAPK pathway, intricate interaction of many signal pathways, and cancer heterogeneity. Thus combinational therapy with drugs targeting multiple signaling pathways becomes a new promising therapy. Here, we report a family of stilbene-like compounds called A11 that can inhibit melanoma growth in both melanoma-forming zebrafish embryos and mouse melanoma cells. The growth inhibition by A11 is a result of mitosis reduction but not apoptosis enhancement. Meanwhile, A11 activates both MAPK and Akt signaling pathways. Many A11-treated mouse melanoma cells exhibit morphological changes and resemble normal melanocytes. Furthermore, we found that A11 causes down-regulation of melanocyte differentiation genes, including Pax3 and MITF. Together, our results suggest that A11 could be a new melanoma therapeutic agent by inhibiting melanocyte differentiation and proliferation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Tau protein is characterized by a complex pattern of phosphorylation and is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Human AT100 nuclear tau, endowed by phosphorylation in Thr212/Ser214, was recently shown to decline in cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a defined function for this nuclear tau remains unclear. Here we show that AT100 progressively increases in the nuclei of neuronal and non-neuronal cells during aging, and decreases in the more severe AD stages, as recently shown, and in cancer cells (colorectal adenocarcinoma and breast cancer). AT100, in addition to a co-localization with the DAPI-positive heterochromatin, was detected in the nucleolus of pyramidal cells from the CA1 region, shown to be at its highest level in the more senescent cells and in the first stage of AD (ADI), and disappearing in the more severe AD cases (ADIV). Taking into account the nuclear distribution of AT100 during cell aging and its relation to the chromatin changes observed in degenerated neurons, as well as in cancerous cells, which are both cellular pathologies associated with age, we can consider the Thr212/Ser214 phosphorylated nuclear tau as a molecular marker of cell aging. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A signal-on photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor was constructed for detecting tumor marker in this work. α-fetoprotein (AFP) was chosen as a model analyte to investigate the prepared procedure and the analytical performance of the exploited sensor. In order to construct the sensor, CdSe QDs were used as photoactive material, biotin conjugated AFP antibody (Bio-anti-AFP) as detecting probe, streptavidin (SA) as signal capturing unit, biotin functionalized apoferritin encapsulated ascorbic acid (Bio-APOAA) as amplification unit, which were assembled onto the electrodes. The sensing strategy was based on in situ enzymatic hydrolysis of Bio-APOAA to release ascorbic acid (AA) as sacrificial electron donor to produce photocurrent. The photocurrent from the immunosensor was monitored as a result of AFP concentrations. The constructed sensing platform displayed high selectivity and good sensitivity for detecting AFP. Under optimal conditions, a wide linear range from 0.001 to 1000 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 0.31 pg/mL were obtained. The developed immunosensor is expected to be used to determine AFP and other tumor markers in human plasma in clinical laboratories either for pre-cancer screening or cancer monitoring. Moreover, this sensing platform further has the potential to use for the detection of trypsin activity and the corresponding inhibitor-screening. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Furanocoumarins derived from herbal and citrus extracts can act as antibacterial, antioxidant, immunomodulator, apoptotic, and selective anticancer agents, prompting a biological investigation to determine and predict their clinical therapeutic significance. Here, the cell cytotoxic effects of bergapten and xanthotoxin were analyzed alone and in combination with standard chemotherapeutics on three multidrug resistant cells and their nonresistant parental counterparts. The furanocoumarins modulatory effects on MDR1, BCRP, and MRP pump expression and function were investigated. Although quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that the MDR transcript level changes in a time dependent manner, flow cytometric analyses using fluorescent-labeled antibodies have indicated that bergapten and xanthotoxin had no significant effect on the protein levels. FACS analyses indicated that these prominent anticancer agents significantly blocked MDR1, BCRP, and MRP transporter function. Maximum furanocoumarin-mediated pump activity blockage in the MDR-resistant cells was quantified as 87% of normal and consequently, chemotherapeutic accumulation increased up to 2.7-fold and cytotoxicity tension increased 104-fold. MDR1 efflux kinetics also revealed that the maximum velocity and the pump affinity to daunorubicin were uncompetitively decreased. We conclude that bergapten and xanthotoxin are cytotoxic agents capable of preventing daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, and cisplatin binding to ABC-transporters and subsequently inhibiting their efflux out of cells and they may be a potential combination therapy for malignant cancers. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "A series of novel hydantoin-bridged analogues of combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) were designed, synthesized and evaluated for antiproliferative activities in vitro and in vivo. The most potent compound 8d, showed potent cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 0.186–0.279 μM, and possessed the efficacy of inhibiting tubulin polymerization, disrupting in vitro vascularization, blocking cell cycle in G2/M phase and inducing cell apoptosis. In the nude mice xenograft model, 8d significantly inhibited the tumor growth and showed low toxicity. Further chiral separation proved (R)-(−)-8d to be the preferential enantiomer with IC50 values of 0.081–0.157 M. These results indicated that the hydantoin derivatives merit further investigation as potential anticancer agents that inhibit tubulin polymerization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Reconstruction is an integral part of the surgical management of oral cancer. Local flaps are one of the options in reconstruction of small to moderate sized defects of oral cavity. Reconstruction is an integral part of the surgical management of oral cancer. Every defect needs to be assessed individually to tailor made the reconstruction because of its multidimensionality and complexity. Varieties of autologous tissues are being used in reconstruction like local, regional, or free flaps which can be simple or complex tissues. There is always a trend to identify the newer flaps/technique to personalize reconstruction. Local flaps are also one of the options in reconstruction of small to moderate sized defects of oral cavity. Local tissue if it is available is in the primary surgeon's purview and the flap can be raised without much technical difficulty and morbidity. We used perforator based tissue from the face and neck which is richly supplied by the facial vessels and named as the Cervicofacial- Facial Artery Myocutaneous flap (C-FAM flap) for reconstruction of oral cavity. Methods: We used perforator based local tissue from the face and neck which is supplied by facial vessels and named it as the C-FAM flap for the reconstruction of oral cavity defects. Results: Twenty-eight patients underwent C-FAM flap reconstruction in different subsites of the oral cavity with acceptable functional rehabilitation. There was no flap loss. Conclusion: The C-FAM flap is a robust flap, which is reliable, pliable, and rich in its vascularity. It has to be one of the armamentarium for the oral cavity reconstruction.

    "Abstract": "The development of multi-drug resistance to existing anticancer drugs is one of the major challenges in cancer treatment. The over-expression of cytochrome P450 1B1 enzyme has been reported to cause resistance to cisplatin. With an objective to discover cisplatin-resistance reversal agents, herein, we report the evaluation of Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) extracts and its twelve chemical constituents for inhibition of CYP1B1 (and CYP1A1) enzyme in Sacchrosomes and live human cells. The hydroalcoholic extract showed potent inhibition of CYP1B1 in both Sacchrosomes as well as in live cells with IC50 values of 21 and 16 µg/mL, respectively. Amongst the total of 12 constituents tested, quercetin and glabrol showed inhibition of CYP1B1 in live cell assay with IC50 values of 2.2 and 15 µM, respectively. Both these natural products were found to be selective inhibitors of CYP1B1, and does not inhibit CYP2 and CYP3 family of enzymes (IC50 &gt; 20 µM). The hydroalcoholic extract of G. glabra and quercetin (4) showed complete reversal of cisplatin resistance in CYP1B1 overexpressing triple negative MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. The selective inhibition of CYP1B1 by quercetin and glabrol over CYP2 and CYP3 family of enzymes was studied by molecular modeling studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "To follow up on our recent discovery of the 18-amino acid all-hydrocarbon [i, i + 4]-stapled p110α[E545K] peptide 1 that was shown to potently block the intracellular p110α[E545K]-IRS1 interaction (a protein-protein interaction uniquely present in cancer cells expressing p110α[E545K]) and the growth of the xenograft tumors formed by cancers harboring this mutation, in the current study we prepared and examined six derivatives of 1, i.e. stapled peptides 2-A, 2-B, 3-A, 3-B, 4-A, 4-B. We found that 2-A, 2-B, 4-A, and 4-B had higher % α-helicity than 1; moreover, the enhanced % α-helicity also led to an enhanced proteolytic stability. When compared with 1, the structurally simplified 14-amino acid 4-A and 4-B were found to more potently deactivate the AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in the p110α[E545K]-expressing colon cancer cells, whose activation was previously demonstrated by us to be specifically derived from the p110α[E545K]-IRS1 interaction. The preliminary findings from the current study have laid a foundation for future more extensive studies on the stapled p110α[E545K] peptides newly identified in the current study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

PVA/TPGS/phloretin NF with 321 nm mean diameter and >90% drug entrapment efficiency was fabricated by an electrospinning method. Transformation of drug from crystalline to amorphous state was identified by solid-state studies. NF structure was changed to nanoparticles after its dispersing in the aqueous medium. PVA/TPGS/phloretin NF exhibited fast wetting property and smaller hydrodynamic size of dispersion, compared with PVA/phloretin NF. The amphiphilic property of TPGS also contributed to the improved drug release from PVA/TPGS/phloretin NF. The anticancer activities of phloretin, via the inhibition of glucose uptake into the cancer cells, in NFs were assessed in YD-9 cells (oral squamous cell carcinoma from buccal cheek). The antiproliferation efficacy of PVA/TPGS/phloretin NF was significantly higher than that of phloretin solution and PVA/phloretin NF (p < 0.05). Higher apoptotic events were also observed in PVA/TPGS/phloretin NF group rather than phloretin solution and PVA/phloretin NF groups (p < 0.05). All these results support that PVA/TPGS/phloretin NF can be a promising fast dissolving formulation for the treatment of oral cancers. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The immune profile of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (sRCC), including the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) status, has not been well characterized. METHODS: An immunohistochemical digital analysis of PD-L1, PD-1, CD4, and CD8 was performed on nephrectomy specimens from 118 sRCC patients and 92 nonsarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. The clinical characteristics of the population were compared between sRCC and ccRCC. Overall survival was estimated, and comparisons were made between PD-L1–positive and PD-L1–negative groups as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)–high and TIL-low groups. RESULTS: The PD-L1 H-score of sRCC (mean, 3.7; range, 0-192.1) was significantly higher than the score of grade 4 ccRCC (P =.001), and 41.3% of sRCC cases showed a PD-L1 H-score ≥ 10. The PD-1–positive cell density was significantly higher in sRCC versus ccRCC within the tumor and at the invasive front. The intratumoral CD8-positive cell density was significantly higher in sRCC versus ccRCC. Forty-one percent in the sarcomatoid component of sRCC and 8% in the epithelioid component of sRCC had an adaptive immune resistance phenotype (PD-L1–positive and TIL-positive), whereas only 1% in ccRCC had the type I phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: sRCC showed higher PD-L1 expression and higher PD-1– and CD8-positive cell density than grade 4 ccRCC. The results indicate a notable immunosuppressive environment in sRCC. Despite advances in the treatment of advanced-stage renal cell carcinoma, sRCC still has a poor prognosis. This work describes highly immunosuppressive characteristics of sRCC in comparison with an appropriate ccRCC control. The results suggest PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy as a potential therapeutic approach for sRCC. Cancer 2017;123:4823-31. © 2017 American Cancer Society. © 2017 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Isocorydine (ICD), an aporphine alkaloid, is widely distributed in nature. Its ability to target side population (SP) cells found in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes it and its derivative 8-amino-isocorydine (NICD) promising chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of HCC. To improve the anticancer activity of isocorydine derivatives, twenty derivatives of NICD were designed and synthesized through chemical structure modifications of the aromatic amino group at C-8. The anti-proliferative activities of all synthesized compounds against human hepatocellular (HepG2), cervical (HeLa), and gastric (MGC-803) cancer cell lines were evaluated using an MTT assay. The results showed that all the synthetic compounds had some tumor cell growth inhibitory activity. The compound COM33 (24) was the most active with IC50 values under 10 μM (IC50 for HepG2 = 7.51 µM; IC50 for HeLa = 6.32 μM). FICD (12) and COM33 (24) were selected for further investigation of their in vitro and in vivo activities due to their relatively good antiproliferative properties. These two compounds significantly downregulated the expression of four key proteins (C-Myc, β-Catenin, CylinD1, and Ki67) in HepG2 cells. The tumor inhibition rate of COM33 (24) in vivo was 73.8% after a dose 100 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection and the combined inhibition rate of COM33 (24) (50 mg/kg) with sorafenib (50 mg/kg) was 66.5%. The results indicated that these isocorydine derivatives could potentially be used as targeted chemotherapy agents or could be further developed in combination with conventional chemotherapy drugs to target cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the main therapeutic targets in HCC. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "African ancestry and obesity are associated with higher risk of prostate cancer (PC). In a pilot study, we explored interactions between obesity (as measured by waist to hip ratio (WHR)) and inflammatory SNPs in relation to PC risk among Jamaican men. This study evaluated 87 chemokine and cytokine associated SNPs in obese and normal weight cases (N = 109) and controls (N = 102) using a stepwise penalized logistic regression approach in multivariable analyses. Upon stratification by WHR (normal weight (WHR < 0.90) or obese (WHR ≥ 0.90)), inheritance of CCR6 rs2023305 AG + GG (OR = 1.75, p = 0.007), CCR9 rs7613548 AG + GG (OR = 1.71, p = 0.012) and IL10ra rs2229113 AG + GG (OR = 1.45, p = 0.01) genotypes was associated with increase in overall or low grade (Gleason score < 7) PC risk among normal weight men. These odds were elevated among obese men who possessed the CCR5 rs1799987 AG + GG (OR = 1.95, p = 0.003) and RNASEL rs12135247 CT + TT genotypes (OR = 1.59, p = 0.05). CCR7 rs3136685 AG + GG (p = 0.032) was associated with a 1.52–1.70 fold increase in the risk of high grade cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7) among obese men. CCR7 variant emerged as an important factor associated with high grade PC risk among obese men in our analyses. Overall, genetic loci found significant in normal weight men were not significant in obese men and vice-versa, partially explaining the role of obesity on PC risk among black men. Also, older age was an important risk factor both in normal weight and obese men but only with regard to low grade PC. Associations of inflammatory SNPs with obesity are suggestive and require further validation in larger cohorts to help develop an understanding of PC risk among obese and non-obese men of African descent. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background Triterpene glycosides are a vast group of secondary metabolites widely distributed in plants including a high number of biologically active compounds. The pharmacological potential is evaluated by using many bioassays particularly in the field of cancerology, immunology, and microbiology. The adjuvant concept is well known for these molecules in vaccines, but there is little preclinical evidence to support this concept in the management of cancer, infections and inflammation. Purpose We aim to review some examples of triterpene glycosides from natural sources which exhibit adjuvant activity when they are co-adminitered with anticancer drugs, targeted toxins, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory drugs and with antigens in vaccines. Methods The scientific literature on the adjuvant potential of triterpene glycosides covering mainly the last two decades has been identified by using relevant key words in the databases, using the online service such as Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar. Results We divided these findings in four kind of examples, the combination of triterpene glycosides (1) with chemotherapeutic agents in conventional tumor therapies and with targeted toxins, (2) with antimicrobial drugs, (3) with antiinflammatory drugs, and (4) with an antigen in prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Pharmacological studies have revealed that some triterpene glycosides co-administered with anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, 5-fluorouracyl, mitoxantrone exhibited increased cytotoxicity in tumor cells better than when the drugs were administered alone. However in vivo toxicological and pharmacokinetic studies are required before the combination strategy can be applied into clinical practice. Other studies showed that combined application of triterpene glycosides with targeted toxins resulted in the increased efficacy of the toxin, simultaneously reducing the dosage, and side effects. It was also shown that the co-administration of the triterpenoids with corticosteroids synergistically inhibited the inflammatory response induced by carrageenan in rats. The search for new alternative adjuvants in vaccines in comparison with the aluminium salts inducing only a Th2-type immune response resulted in the discovery of the promising purified fraction QS-21 from Quillaja saponaria, which has been used in the development of a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Over 120 clinical trials for around 20 vaccine indications in infectious diseases, cancer, degenerative disorders have been reported involving more than 50,000 patients. Conclusion This review summarized the successfull in vitro and in vivo studies showing that this combination approach of triterpene glycosides co-adminitered with anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory drug may provide an exciting road for further developments in the treatment of some cancers, parasitic and inflammatory diseases and in the rational design of vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer. From a clinical point of view, the potential benefit of QS-21, a promising triterpene glycoside from Quillaja saponaria has been highlighted in several vaccine clinical trials with a favorable ratio efficacy/toxicity. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",

    "Abstract": "Multiple immunotherapy platforms have been investigated for prostate cancer, but sipuleucel-T still remains the sole approved autologous cellular immune product that can be used in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. While preliminary data for specific checkpoint inhibitors suggest benefit for some patients, leading to durable responses, it has been clear that sipuleucel-T can affect not only the intratumoral milieu but also systemic immune populations. This means that the immune system can respond to sipuleucel-T in such a way that it may also effect an immunomodulatory response to other current and future treatments. It is clear that sipuleucel-T is here to stay; nevertheless, efforts to enhance its efficacy continue. A challenge that continues to be investigated is the question of how and when to use this immune therapy as part of the current continuum of competing approved agents.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Primary liver cancer is a lethal malignancy with a high mortality worldwide. Currently, sorafenib is the most effective molecular-targeted drug against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the sorafenib resistance rate is high. The molecular mechanism of this resistance has not been fully elucidated. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a multifaceted protein that plays a key role in the proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis and angiogenesis of HCC cells. In addition, HMGB1 has been suggested to contribute to chemotherapy resistance in tumours, including lung cancer, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer. This study investigated the association between HMGB1 and sorafenib resistance in HCC. Methods: HepG2 cells with HMGB1 knockdown or overexpression were generated. The efficacy of sorafenib in these cells was tested using flow cytometry and a cell counting assay. The subcellular localization of HMGB1 in HepG2 cells following sorafenib treatment was measured by western blotting and confocal microscopy. A murine subcutaneous HCC model was generated to examine the association between HMGB1 and the sensitivity of sorafenib treatment. Results: The HMGB1 knockdown cells exhibited a significantly higher apoptotic level and lower cell viability than the normal HMGB1 expressing cells following the sorafenib treatment. In addition, the cell viability observed in the HMGB1 overexpressing cells was higher than that observed in the control cells following the sorafenib intervention. Sorafenib had a better tumour inhibition effect in the HMGB1 knockdown group in vivo. The amount of mitochondrial HMGB1 decreased, while the amount of cytosolic HMGB1 increased following the exposure to sorafenib. Altogether, HMGB1 translocated from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm outside the mitochondria following the exposure of HepG2 cells to sorafenib. Conclusions: A novel potential role of HMGB1 in the regulation of sorafenib therapy resistance in HCC was observed. The knockdown of HMGB1 restores sensitivity to sorafenib and enhances HepG2 cell death, while HMGB1 overexpression blunts these effects. The translocation of HMGB1 from the mitochondria to the cytosol following sorafenib treatment provides new insight into sorafenib resistance in HCC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: DNA methylation has been implicated as a promising biomarker for precise cancer diagnosis. However, limited DNA methylation-based biomarkers have been described in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: A high-throughput DNA methylation dataset (100 samples) of ESCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project was analyzed and validated along with another independent dataset (12 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The methylation status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy controls was also utilized for biomarker selection. The candidate CpG sites as well as their adjacent regions were further validated in 94 pairs of ESCC tumor and adjacent normal tissues from the Chinese Han population using the targeted bisulfite sequencing method. Logistic regression and several machine learning methods were applied for evaluation of the diagnostic ability of our panel. Results: In the discovery stage, five hyper-methylated CpG sites were selected as candidate biomarkers for further analysis as shown below: cg15830431, P = 2.20 × 10-4; cg19396867, P = 3.60 × 10-4; cg20655070, P = 3.60 × 10-4; cg26671652, P = 5.77 × 10-4; and cg27062795, P = 3.60 × 10-4. In the validation stage, the methylation status of both the five CpG sites and their adjacent genomic regions were tested. The diagnostic model based on the combination of these five genomic regions yielded a robust performance (sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.88, AUC = 0.85). Eight statistical models along with five-fold cross-validation were further applied, in which the SVM model reached the best accuracy in both training and test dataset (accuracy = 0.82 and 0.80, respectively). In addition, subgroup analyses revealed a significant difference in diagnostic performance between the alcohol use and non-alcohol use subgroups.

    "Abstract": "Previous studies had shown that xanthatin, a natural xanthanolide sesquiterpene lactone, could induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Here, we examined whether the DNA damage response (DDR) could be a primary cytotoxic event underlying xanthatin-mediated anti-tumor activity. Using EdU incorporation assay in combination with novel imaging flow cytometry, our data indicated that xanthatin suppressed DNA replication, prevented cells from G2/M entry and increased the spot count of γH2AX nuclear foci. Given that checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) represents a core component in DDR-mediated cell cycle transition and the phosphorylation on Ser-345 is essential for kinase activation and function, we surprisingly found xanthatin distinctly modulated Ser-345 phosphorylation of Chk1 in A549 and H1299 cells. Further investigation on Cdc25C/CDK1/CyclinB1 signaling cascade in the absence or presence of pharmacological DDR inhibitors showed that xanthatin directly destabilized the protein levels of Cdc25C, and recovery of p53 expression in p53-deficient H1299 cells further intensified xanthatin-mediated inhibition of Cdc25C, suggesting p53-dependent regulation of Cdc25C in a DDR machinery. Moreover, exogenous expression of Cdc25C was also substantially repressed by xanthatin and partially impaired xanthatin-induced G2 arrest. In addition, xanthatin could induce accumulation of ubiquitinated Cdc25C without undergoing further proteasomal degradation. However, an alternative lysosomal proteolysis of Cdc25C was observed. Interestingly, lysosome-like vesicles were produced upon xanthatin treatment, accompanied by rapid accumulation of lysosomal associated membrane protein LAPM-1. Furthermore, vacuolar proton (V)-ATPases inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and lysosomal proteases inhibitor leupeptin could remarkably overturn the levels of Cdc25C in xanthatin-treated H1299 cells. Altogether, these data provide insight into how xanthatin can be effectively targeted DDR molecules towards certain tumors. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: In this study, methotrexate sustained-release implants were prepared and investigated for their potential usage for cancer treatment. The degradation ration and cumulative release in vitro and in vivo of the sustained-release implants were determined separately. The effect of methotrexate sustained-release implants on delayed sarcoma recurrence was explored. The methotrexate sustained-release implants made herein were compared with traditional delivery system to explore their clinical superiority and advantages. Methods: PLGA and PEG4000 were used as excipients and hot-melting extrusion method was applied to fabricate methotrexate sustained-release implants, whose cumulative release ratio in vitro and in vivo were measured by UV and HPLC, respectively. HPLC was also applied to determine the drug actual contents in the produced implants. KM mice were inoculated subcutaneously with Sarcoma 180 cells at the axillary region to simulate postoperative residual lesions. Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical operation model was fabricated and the effect of local administration of methotrexate sustained-release implants on delayed sarcoma recurrence was evaluated. Results: Yellow uniform methotrexate sustained-release implants with a diameter of 0.88 mm were successfully fabricated by hot-melting extrusion method. Further characterization results demonstrated that drug actual content was up to (8.34±0.65)%, which was consistent with theoretical content. Methotrexate sustained-release implants we made herein could maintain a sustained and controlled release up to 7 d in vitro release and 15 d in vivo release respectively. Compared with traditional delivery system, methotrexate sustained-release implants prepared in this research were more effective in delaying tumor recurrence and prolonging the survival of mice and the implants could avoid some adverse effects. Conclusion: Hot-melting extrusion method can be applied successfully to fabricate methotrexate sustained-release implants, which have the advantages such as controlled slow-release and long-acting, and then can overcome some shortcomings and defects of the administration method of methotrexate, and might be a promising formulation for delaying local tumor recurrence. © 2017, Chinese Journal of New Drugs Co.

    "Abstract": "Liposomalization causes alteration of the pharmacokinetics of encapsulated drugs, and allows delivery to tumor tissues through passive targeting via an enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®, Lipo-DXR), a representative liposomal drug, is well-known to reduce cardiotoxicity and increase the anti-tumor activity of DXR, but to induce the hand-foot syndrome (HFS) as a result of skin DXR accumulation, which is one of its severe adverse effects. We have developed a new liposomal preparation of oxaliplatin (l-OHP), an important anti-tumor drug for treatment of colorectal cancer, using PEGylated liposomes (Lipo-l-OHP), and showed that Lipo-l-OHP exhibits increased anti-tumor activity in tumor-bearing mice compared to the original preparation of l-OHP. However, whether Lipo-l-OHP causes HFS-like skin toxicity similar to Lipo-DXR remains to be determined. Administration of Lipo-l-OHP promoted accumulation of platinum in rat hind paws, however, it caused negligible morphological and histological alterations on the plantar surface of the paws. Administration of DiI-labeled empty PEGylated liposomes gave almost the same distribution profile of dyes into the dermis of hind paws with DXR as in the case of Lipo-DXR. Treatment with Lipo-l-OHP, Lipo-DXR, DiI-labeled empty PEGylated liposomes or empty PEGylated liposomes caused migration of CD68+ macrophages into the dermis of hind paws. These findings suggest that the skin toxicity on administration of liposomalized drugs is reflected in the proinflammatory characteristics of encapsulated drugs, and indicate that Lipo-l-OHP with a higher anti-cancer effect and no HFS may be an outstanding l-OHP preparation leading to an improved quality of life of cancer patients. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Oncolytic virus therapy has recently been recognized as a promising new therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. In this study, we are proposing for the first time to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo oncolytic capacities of the Cowpox virus (CPXV). To improve the tumor selectivity and oncolytic activity, we developed a thymidine kinase (TK)-deleted CPXV expressing the suicide gene FCU1, which converts the non-toxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorouridine-5′-monophosphate (5-FUMP). This TK-deleted virus replicated efficiently in human tumor cell lines; however, it was notably attenuated in normal primary cells, thus displaying a good therapeutic index. Furthermore, this new recombinant poxvirus rendered cells sensitive to 5-FC. In vivo, after systemic injection in mice, the TK-deleted variant caused significantly less mortality than the wild-type strain. A biodistribution study demonstrated high tumor selectivity and low accumulation in normal tissues. In human xenograft models of solid tumors, the recombinant CPXV also displayed high replication, inducing relevant tumor growth inhibition. This anti-tumor effect was improved by 5-FC co-administration. These results demonstrated that CPXV is a promising oncolytic vector capable of expressing functional therapeutic transgenes. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Resistance to clinical antiandrogens has plagued the evolution of effective therapeutics for advanced prostate cancer. As with the first-line therapeutic bicalutamide (Casodex), resistance to newer antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509) develops quickly in patients, despite the fact that these drugs have ∼10-fold better affinity for the androgen receptor than bicalutamide. Improving affinity alone is often not sufficient to prevent resistance, and alternative strategies are needed to improve antiandrogen efficacy. Covalent and reversible covalent drugs are being used to thwart drug resistance in other contexts, and activated aryl nitriles are among the moieties being exploited for this purpose. We capitalized on the presence of an aryl nitrile in bicalutamide, and the existence of a native cysteine residue (Cys784) in the androgen receptor ligand binding pocket, to develop 5N-bicalutamide, a cysteine-reactive antiandrogen. 5N-bicalutamide exhibits a 150-fold improvement in Ki and 20-fold improvement in IC50 over the parent compound. We attribute the marked improvement in affinity and activity to the formation of a covalent adduct with Cys784, a residue that is not among the more than 160 androgen receptor point mutations associated with prostate cancer. Increasing the residence time of bound antiandrogen via formation of a covalent adduct may forestall the drug resistance seen with current clinical antiandrogens. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "To address the complexity of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) process, we previously developed a unified approach for the association test for X-chromosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the disease of interest, accounting for different biological possibilities of XCI: random, skewed, and escaping XCI. In the original study, we focused on the SNP-disease association test but did not provide knowledge regarding the underlying XCI models. One can use the highest likelihood ratio (LLR) to select XCI models (max-LLR approach). However, that approach does not formally compare the LLRs corresponding to different XCI models to assess whether the models are distinguishable. Therefore, we propose an LLR comparison procedure (comp-LLR approach), inspired by the Cox test, to formally compare the LLRs of different XCI models to select the most likely XCI model that describes the underlying XCI process. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the max-LLR and comp-LLR approaches. The simulation results show that compared with the max-LLR, the comp-LLR approach has higher probability of identifying the correct underlying XCI model for the scenarios when the underlying XCI process is random XCI, escaping XCI, or skewed XCI to the deleterious allele. We applied both approaches to a head and neck cancer genetic study to investigate the underlying XCI processes for the X-chromosomal genetic variants. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "There remain gaps in knowledge concerning how vascular morphology evolves during carcinogenesis. In this study, we imaged neovascularization by label-free dark-field microscopy of a 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster cheek pouchmodel of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).Wavelengthdependent imaging revealed distinct vascular features at different imaging depths and vessel sizes. Vascular tortuosity increased significantly in high-risk lesions, whereas diameter decreased significantly in hyperplastic and SCC lesions. Large vessels preserved the same trends seen in the original images, whereas small vessels displayed different trends, with length and diameter increasing during carcinogenesis. On the basis of these data, we developed and validated a classification algorithm incorporating vascular features from different vessel masks. Receiver operator curves generated from the classification results demonstrated high accuracies in discriminating normal and hyperplasia from high-grade lesions (AUC > 0.94). Overall, these results provided automated imaging of vasculature in the earliest stages of carcinogenesis from which one can extract robust endpoints. The optical toolbox described here is simple, low-cost and portable, and can be used in a variety of health care and research settings for cancer prevention and pharmacology research. © 2017 AACR.",

    "Abstract": "A series of new imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine linked with thiazole/thiophene motif through a keto spacer were synthesized and tested for their cytotoxic potential against three human cancer cell lines including A549, HeLa and U87-MG using MTT assay. Compounds A2, A3, A4, C1 and C2 showed cytotoxicity against all the three cell lines. The selectivity index for compound A4 for A549 and HeLa cells was comparable to that of doxorubicin. Among the synthesized compounds, B5 showed the maximum inhibition of NF-κB activity as ascertained by NF-κB reporter assay (IC50 = 6.5 ± 0.6 µM). Treatment of NCI-H23 cells (EGFR overexpressed, KRAS G12V mutant) with erlotinib and gefitinib along with compounds A4 and B5 indicated synergistic and additive potential of combination therapy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The efficiency of a drug is usually highly dependent on the way it is administered or delivered. As such, targeted-therapy, which requires conceiving drug-delivery vehicles that will change their state from a relatively stable structure with a very slow leak-rate to an unstable structure with a fast release, clearly improves the pharmacokinetics, the absorption, the distribution, the metabolism and the therapeutic index of a given drug. In this context, we have developed a particularly effective double stimuli-responsive drug-delivery method allowing an ultrasound-induced release of a monomethylauristatin E-glucuronide prodrug and its subsequent activation by a β-glucuronidase. This led to an increase of cytotoxicity of about 80% on cancer cells. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Background The stimulatory G protein a subunit (Gsα) plays important roles in diverse cell processes including tumorigenesis. Activating mutations in Gsα gene (GNAS) have been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in various human carcinomas. Furthermore, Gsα signaling is crucial in promoting liver regeneration by interacting with growth factor signaling, indicating that Gsα might play a promoting role in cancer development. However, little is known about the correlation between Gsα levels and clinicopathological parameters in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Methods We performed immunoblotting to examine the expression levels of Gsα and Ki67 proteins in tumor tissues and the corresponding adjacent tissues. A total of 74 pair of specimens resected from 74 ICC patients were examined. The association between Gsα levels and clinicopathological findings and prognosis of the patients was evaluated. Results Western blotting demonstrated that the expression of Gsα was significantly higher in ICC tissues compared with that in their corresponding adjacent tissues. Gsα protein was highly expressed in about half of ICC tissues (48.6%, 36/74) while only 28.4% (21/74) of tumor adjacent tissues showed Gsα high expression (P=0.011). High Gsα expression in ICC was significantly associated with the numbers of tumor nodules (P=0.037) and lymph node metastases (P=0.010). Moreover, the level of Gsα was significantly and positively correlated with Ki67 expression (P&lt;0.001). In addition, the recurrence-free survival rate and overall survival rate in the Gsα high group were significantly lower than those in the Gsα low group (P=0.004 and P=0.005, respectively). Conclusions High Gsα expression is correlated with poor prognosis in ICC patients. Gsα might serve as a potential prognostic indicator of ICC. © 2017 The Editorial Board of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases International",

    "Abstract": "A family of phosphamide-containing diphenylpyrimidine analogues (PA-DPPYs) were synthesized as potent focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors. The PA-DPPY derivatives could significantly inhibit the FAK enzymatic activity at concentrations lower than 10.69 nM. Among them, compounds 7a and 7e were two of the most active FAK inhibitors, possessing IC50 values of 4.25 nM and 4.65 nM, respectively. In particular, compound 7e also displayed strong activity against AsPC cell line, with an IC50 of 1.66 μM, but show low activity against the normal HPDE6-C7 cells (IC50 &gt; 20 μM), indicating its low cell cytotoxicity. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis showed that after treatment with 7e (8 μM, 72 h), both AsPC and Panc cells growth were almost totally inhibited, with a cell viability rate of 16.8% and 18.1%, respectively. Overall, compound 7e may be served as a valuable FAK inhibitor for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Tanjung Karang, Selangor, is widely known for its paddy cultivation activity and hosts the third largest paddy field in Malaysia. Pesticides contamination in agriculture fields has become an unavoidable problem, as pesticides are used to increase paddy productivity and reduce plant disease. Human exposure to agrichemicals is common and could results in both acute and chronic health effects, such as acute and chronic neurotoxicity. This study aims to determine the concentrations of commonly used pesticides (azoxystrobin, buprofezin, chlorantraniliprole, difenoconazole, fipronil, imidacloprid, isoprothiolane, pretilachlor, propiconazole, pymetrozine, tebuconazole, tricyclazole, and trifloxystrobin) in personal air samples and their associated health risks among paddy farmers. Eighty-three farmers from Tangjung Karang, Selangor were involved in this study. A solid sorbent tube was attached to the farmer's breathing zone with a clip, and an air pump was fastened to the belt to collect personal air samples. Pesticides collected in the XAD-2 resin were extracted with acetone, centrifuged, concentrated via nitrogen blowdown and reconstituted with 1 mL of 3:1 ultrapure water/HPLC-grade methanol solution. The extract was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The target compounds were detected with a maximum concentration reaching up to 462.5 ng m − 3 (fipronil). The hazard quotient (HQ) was less than 1 and the hazard index (HI) value was 3.86 × 10 − 3 , indicating that the risk of pesticides related diseases was not significant. The lifetime cancer risk (LCR) for pymetrozine was at an acceptable level (LCR &lt; 10 − 6 ) with 4.10 × 10 − 8 . The results reported in this study can be beneficial in terms of risk management within the agricultural community. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Malignant hip lesions can be managed operatively by intramedullary (IM) nail fixation and hemiarthroplasty. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on 86 patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty (n = 22) or IM nail fixation (n = 64) for prophylactic treatment of impending pathologic fracture due to malignant lesions of the hip. Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression modeling were performed to determine risk of death, fixation failure, pain relief, and return to ambulation without gait aids. Results: Median survival time after surgery was 8.8 months (with no difference in survival between hemiarthroplasty and IM nail [adjusted Hazard Ratio 1.40, CI 0.72, 2.53; P = 0.31]). Hemiarthroplasty was associated with lower risk of pathologic fracture, fixation failure, or reoperation (adjusted HR 0.02, CI < 0.001, 0.48; P = 0.01). Hemiarthroplasty did not increase odds of unassisted ambulation compared to IM nail fixation (adjusted Odds Ratio [OR] 2.23, CI 0.56, 9.71; P = 0.26). The strongest predictor of postoperative ambulation was preoperative ambulation without aids (adjusted OR 28.9, CI 7.37, 161; P < 0.001). Conclusions: There is no difference in survival or likelihood of unassisted ambulation after prophylactic femoral fixation with IM nails versus hemiarthroplasty in patients with metastatic disease of proximal femur. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background Melanoma metastasizing to the heart (cardiac melanoma) is a rare entity that has been described only in autopsy studies or isolated pre-mortem case reports. We aim to better characterize cardiac melanoma, and describe its presenting features, imaging findings, and disease course with a case series collected over nearly 30 years. Methods We performed a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with cardiac melanoma at the Mayo Clinic from 1988 to 2015. Qualitative analysis was performed on patient demographics, clinical history, and imaging modalities. Results 11 patients (7 male, median age 63 years) were identified with cardiac melanoma. Shortness of breath (64%) was the most common presenting symptom. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was utilized in the assessment of all patients though it failed to identify 20% of masses that were seen on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The majority of masses were located within the cardiac chambers (46% right atrium, 18% right ventricle, 18% left atrium), and 36% appeared mobile on TTE. Patients lived for a median of 68 months (interquartile range [IQR] 14–143 months) after the initial diagnosis of primary melanoma, and only 12 months (IQR 2–150 months) after diagnosis of cardiac melanoma. Conclusion Echocardiography can generally identify most cases of cardiac melanoma, though it misses one-fifth of masses seen on FDG PET/CT or CMR. Cardiac melanoma is associated with a poor prognosis. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the few cancers with a continuous increase in incidence and mortality. Drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of HCC. In this study, two sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines and a nude mouse subcutaneously tumor model were used to explore the possible mechanisms leading to sorafenib resistance, and to investigate whether aspirin could increase the sensitivity of hepatoma cells to sorafenib. The combination of aspirin and sorafenib resulted in a synergistic antitumor effect against liver tumors both in vitro and in vivo. High glycolysis and PFKFB3 overexpression occupied a dominant position in sorafenib resistance, and can be targeted and overcome by aspirin. Aspirin plus sorafenib induced apoptosis in tumors without inducing weight loss, hepatotoxicity or inflammation. Our results suggest that aspirin overcomes sorafenib resistance and their combination may be an effective treatment approach for HCC. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric oncology patients are at high risk of clinical deterioration, particularly in hospitals with resource limitations. The performance of pediatric early warning systems (PEWS) to identify deterioration has not been assessed in these settings. This study evaluates the validity of PEWS to predict the need for unplanned transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among pediatric oncology patients in a resource-limited hospital. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study comparing the highest documented and corrected PEWS score before unplanned PICU transfer in pediatric oncology patients (129 cases) with matched controls (those not requiring PICU care) was performed. RESULTS: Documented and corrected PEWS scores were found to be highly correlated with the need for PICU transfer (area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.940 and 0.930, respectively). PEWS scores increased 24 hours prior to unplanned transfer (P =.0006). In cases, organ dysfunction at the time of PICU admission correlated with maximum PEWS score (correlation coefficient, 0.26; P =.003), patients with PEWS results ≥4 had a higher Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) (P =.028), and PEWS results were higher in patients with septic shock (P =.01). The PICU mortality rate was 17.1%; nonsurvivors had higher mean PEWS scores before PICU transfer (P =.0009). A single-point increase in the PEWS score increased the odds of mechanical ventilation or vasopressors within the first 24 hours and during PICU admission (odds ratio 1.3-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: PEWS accurately predicted the need for unplanned PICU transfer in pediatric oncology patients in this resource-limited setting, with abnormal results beginning 24 hours before PICU admission and higher scores predicting the severity of illness at the time of PICU admission, need for PICU interventions, and mortality. These results demonstrate that PEWS aid in the identification of clinical deterioration in this high-risk population, regardless of a hospital's resource-level.

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: The immune dysfunction in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients is one of the major factors for growth and dissemination of tumor affecting disease-free survival. Methods: The phenotypic and functional characteristics of Regulatory T (Treg) CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ subsets in OSCC patients were assessed by multicolor flow cytometry and its effector component (TGF-β) by Western blot and qRT-PCR. Results: An increased (P &lt; 0.05) prevalence of Treg phenotypes (CD4+CD25+, CD4+FoxP3+, CD8+FoxP3+, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) was observed in the peripheral circulation of OSCC patients that positively correlated with clinicopathological features. The increased frequency of CD4+CD8+CD25+FoxP3+, a unique T cell subset, CTLA-4+, GITR+, NrP1+, HLA-DR+, CD127+, Tbet+, TGF-β+, and granzyme B+ (GzmB) Tregs also showed a significantly higher prevalence in OSCC patients. Functionally, CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs showed skewed expression of IL-2, IL-10, and IL-35 in patients as compared with the normal controls. Further, enhanced expression of CCR5 and CCR7 on Tregs with up regulation of their ligands (CCL5, CCL19, and CCL21) in tumor cells indicates efficient recruitment and trafficking of Tregs to the tumor site. Conclusion: It seems reasonable to assume that modulation of functional dynamics of selective Treg subsets may be useful in developing immunotherapeutic strategy for OSCC patients. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The overexpression of CYP1 family of enzymes is reported to be associated with development of human carcinomas. It has been well reported that CYP1A1 specific inhibitors prevents carcinogenesis. Herein, thirteen pyridine-4-yl series of chalcones were synthesized and screened for inhibition of CYP1 isoforms 1A1, 1B1 and 1A2 in Sacchrosomes™ and live human HEK293 cells. The structure-activity relationship analysis indicated that chalcones bearing tri-alkoxy groups (8a and 8k) on non-heterocyclic ring displayed selective inhibition of CYP1A1 enzyme, with IC50 values of 58 and 65 nM, respectively. The 3,4,5-trimethoxy substituted derivative 8a have shown &gt;10-fold selectivity towards CYP1A1 with respect to other enzymes of the CYP1 sub-family and &gt;100-fold selectivity with respect to CYP2 and CYP3 family of enzymes. The potent and selective CYP1A1 inhibitor 8a displayed antagonism of B[a]P mediated activation of aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in yeast cells, and also protected human cells from CYP1A1-mediated B[a]P toxicity in human cells. This potent and selective inhibitor of CYP1A1 enzyme have a potential for development as cancer chemopreventive agent. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The stability of human flavoproteins strongly depends on flavin levels, although the structural and energetic basis of this relationship is poorly understood. Here, we report an in-depth analysis on the thermodynamics of FAD binding to one of the most representative examples of such relationship, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). NQO1 is a dimeric enzyme that tightly binds FAD, which triggers large structural changes upon binding. A common cancer-associated polymorphism (P187S) severely compromises FAD binding. We show that FAD binding is described well by a thermodynamic model explicitly incorporating binding cooperativity when applied to different sets of calorimetric analyses and NQO1 variants, thus providing insight on the effects in vitro and in cells of cancer-associated P187S, its suppressor mutation H80R and the role of NQO1 C-terminal domain to modulate binding cooperativity and energetics. Furthermore, we show that FAD binding to NQO1 is very sensitive to physiologically relevant environmental conditions, such as the presence of phosphate buffer and salts. Overall, our results contribute to understanding at the molecular level the link between NQO1 stability and fluctuations of FAD levels intracellularly, and supports the notion that FAD binding energetics and cooperativity are fundamentally linked with the dynamic nature of apo-NQO1 conformational ensemble. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pracinostat is a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor with antitumor activity in both solid tumor and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Pracinostat is reported to have modest clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Given the higher preclinical sensitivity of hematologic malignancies to pracinostat, the authors conducted a phase 1 study to assess the safety, maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of pracinostat in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. METHODS: Pracinostat was administered orally 3 times a week for 3 weeks on a 28-day cycle. Patients were assigned to 7 dose levels using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were enrolled, 25 of whom had AML and 14 of whom had myelodysplastic syndrome. The maximum tolerated dose was 120 mg and the recommended phase 2 dose was 60 mg. Two patients with AML achieved a response: 1 complete remission (CR) and 1 complete cytogenetic response. Despite a dose-dependent increase in the plasma concentration of pracinostat, a similar increase in histone acetylation was not observed. As an extension, 10 additional patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were enrolled to assess the safety and efficacy of pracinostat in combination with azacitidine. Six patients achieved a CR and 3 achieved a CR without platelet recovery with no added toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that pracinostat is safe, with modest single-agent activity in patients with hematological malignancies.

    "Abstract": "Malignancies are characterized by several drastic metabolic changes, one of which is a progressive rise in the levels of serum copper. This rise in serum copper is documented across all malignancies and across malignancies in several species. This study aims to explore in vitro the effect of increased copper levels on the structure of the blood protein human serum albumin. Exposure of human serum albumin to physiologically relevant copper concentrations for 21 days resulted in structural modifications in the protein which were evident by changes in the intrinsic florescence. A loss of the predominantly alpha helical structure of human serum albumin was recorded along with a tendency to form protein aggregates. This aggregation was characterized by Thioflavin T and Congo Red assays. Rayleigh light scattering and turbidity assays confirmed aggregation. The aggregates were visually confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. This is the first report implicating increased copper levels as a cause of aggregation of blood proteins in malignancies. The physiological and biochemical implications of this phenomenon are discussed. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "CTP synthase (CTPS) can aggregate into an intracellular macrostructure, the cytoophidium, in various organisms including human cells. Previous studies have shown that assembly of human CTPS cytoophidia may be correlated with the cellular metabolic status, and is able to promote the activity of CTPS. A correlation between the cytoophidium and cancer metabolism has been proposed but not yet been revealed. In the current study we provide clear evidence of the presence of CTPS cytoophidia in various human cancers and some non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, among 203 tissue samples of hepatocellular carcinoma, 56 (28%) samples exhibited many cytoophidia, whereas no cytoophidia were detected in adjacent non-cancerous hepatocytes for all samples. Our findings suggest that the CTPS cytoophidium may participate in the adaptive metabolism of human hepatocellular carcinoma. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the possible roles of miR-34a expression in thyroid lesions, to unravel the correlation between fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and miR-34a expression and moreover, to discover the underlying mechanisms by which miR-34a regulates FDG avidity. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 75 patients with pathology-confirmed thyroid diseases who underwent 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) within 3 months before undergoing thyroid surgery and miR-34a analysis from June 2012 to July 2017. 18F-FDG uptake of thyroid lesions was also analyzed semiquantitatively using maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). The association between miR-34a expression and clinicopathological variables (age, sex, TNM stage, histopathology, lesion numbers, location and 18F-FDG avidity) was investigated. When there were multiple lesions in thyroid bed, only the one with the highest 18F-FDG uptake was analyzed. Next, we inhibited the miR-34a expression in TPC-1 cells and detected the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA and protein. Results: In the patients cohort, miR-34a was upregulated in those with malignant thyroid diseases compared with benign lesions. The expression of miR-34a was associated with tumor stages, histopathological types and SUVmax. There was an inverse relationship between miR-34a expression and SUVmax in patients with thyroid diseases (Spearman correlation coefficient = –0.553, P < 0.0001). With an SUVmax of 4.3 as the threshold, sensitivity and specificity of the prediction of miR-34a expression (low or high) were 70% and 94.3%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.843 (95% confidence interval: 0.749, 0.936; P = 0.001). Inhibiting miR-34a in TPC-1 cells significantly increased GLUT1 mRNA and protein expression. Conclusion: miR-34a expression was upregulated in thyroid lesions, negatively correlated with SUVmax and can be predicted by FDG SUVmax. In addition, miR-34a may regulate FDG avidity via targeting GLUT1. © 2018 Chen et al.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: We sought to identify the genomic abnormalities in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) arising in ovarian mature cystic teratoma (MCT), a rare gynecological malignancy of poor prognosis. Experimental design: Weperformed copy number, mutational state, and zygosity analysis of 151 genes in SCC arising in MCT (n = 25) using next-generation sequencing. The presence of high-/intermediate-risk HPV genotypes was assessed by quantitative PCR. Genomic events were correlated with clinical features and outcome. Results: MCT had a low mutation burden with a mean of only one mutation per case. Zygosity analyses of MCT indicated four separate patterns, suggesting that MCT can arise from errors at various stages of oogenesis. A total of 244 abnormalities were identified in 79 genes in MCT-associated SCC, and the overall mutational burdenwas high(mean 10.2mutations permegabase). No SCC was positive for HPV. The most frequently altered genes in SCC were TP53 (20/25 cases, 80%), PIK3CA (13/25 cases, 52%), andCDKN2A(11/25 cases, 44%).MutationinTP53was associated with improved overall survival. In 8 of 20 cases with TP53 mutations, two or more variants were identified, which were bi-allelic. Conclusions: Ovarian SCC arising in MCT has a high mutational burden, with TP53 mutation the most common abnormality. The presence of TP53 mutation is a good prognostic factor. SCC arising in MCT share similar mutation profiles to other SCC. Given their rarity, they should be included in basket studies that recruit patients with SCC of other organs. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) represents a serious problem in cancer treatment. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is to identify agents that are selectively lethal to MDR cells. The aim of this study was to discover novel compounds against MDR leukemia and to determine the molecular mechanisms behind collateral sensitivity. A library of 1162 compounds was tested against parental, drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells using the resazurin assay. A total of 302 compounds showed reasonable activity (less than 50% cell viability). Eleven out of 30 lawsone derivatives revealed considerable collateral sensitivity in MDR P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 cells. They reduced β-catenin activity in a Wnt/β-catenin reporter cell line. Their activities significantly correlated with apolar desolvation (R = 0.819). Compound (1) (3-hydroxy-1,4-dioxo-N-phenyl-naphthalene-2-carboxamide) was the most active compound and dose-dependently down-regulated protein expression of β-catenin, c-MYC, Pgp and Frizzled 7. By molecular docking, we predicted that compound (1) bound to the palmitoyl-binding groove of the cysteine-rich domain of Frizzled-7 and Frizzled-8. Compound (1) neither stimulated ATPase activity of Pgp nor reactive oxygen species generation, both of which have been previously described as possible mechanisms of collateral sensitivity. Instead, we found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was selectively inhibited in CEM/ADR5000 cells, but not in CCRF-CEM cells. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling may represent a novel molecular mechanism of collateral sensitivity in MDR cells. Wnt/β-catenin signaling, therefore, represents a potential therapeutic target for the selective killing of Pgp-mediated MDR. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Overexpression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), especially PDK1 has been observed in a variety of cancers. Thus, targeting PDK1 offers an attractive opportunity for the development of cancer therapies. In this letter, we reported the identification of two novel PDK1 inhibitors as anti-osteosarcoma agents. We found that TM-1 and TM-2 inhibited PDK1 with the IC 50 values of 2.97 and 3.41 μM, respectively. Furthermore, TM-1 and TM-2 dose-dependently reduced phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. Finally, TM-1 and TM-2 were found to inhibit the proliferation of MG-63 cells with the EC 50 values of 14.5, and 11.0 μM, respectively, meaning TM-1 and TM-2 could be promising leads for the discovery of potent PDK1 inhibitors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Scutellarin, one of natural flavonoids, is widely and clinically used for treating many diseases in China. Recently, scutellarin has demonstrated a broad spectrum of anti-proliferative activities against multiple cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanism of action remains to be investigated. We herein report the design and synthesis of biotinylated scutellareins as probes, which can be applied to discover scutellarein interacting proteins. Finally, we show that scutellarin directly targets pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and inhibits its cytosolic activity to decrease glycolytic metabolism; on the other hand, scutellarin may also participate in regulating cell cycle and apoptotic proteins by activating MEK/ERK/PIN1 signaling pathway to promote the nuclear translocation of PKM2. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Natural products have documented oncology success history as valuable scaffolds for selective target modulation. Herein, the sapogenin hecogenin (1) was screened for its anti-breast cancer inhibitory capacity using in vitro assays, including proliferation, cytotoxicity, migration, invasion assays, and Western blotting. The results identified 1 as a propitious hit with modest activities attributed to the concurrent down-regulation of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) distinctive downstream effectors. Guided by in silico 3D-structural insights of MAPK kinase domain, an extension strategy was adopted at 1's C-3 and C-12 aimed at the design of novel hecogenin-based analogs with improved target binding affinity. Thirty-three analogs were prepared and tested, among which hecogenin 12-(3′-methylphenyl thiosemicarbazone) (30) displayed the most potent selective anticancer effects. Analog 30 demonstrated antiproliferative, antimigratory and anti-invasive activities at low μM level, compared to the negligible effect on the non-tumorigenic MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. Durable regression of breast tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice was observed after treatments with 30, compared to its parent hecogenin at the same dose regimen, confirmed the hit-to-lead promotion of this analog. Hecogenin-12-thiosemicarbazones, represented by 30, is a novel MEK inhibitory lead class to control breast neoplasms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The human cytokine precursor ECRG4 has been associated with multiple physiological, developmental and pathophysiological processes involving cell proliferation, cell migration, innate immunity, inflammation, cancer progression and metastases. Although down-regulation of ECRG4 gene expression has been largely attributed to hypermethylation of CpG islands in the 5’untranslated region of the ECRG4 promoter, the mechanisms that underlie the dynamics of its regulation have never been systematically described. Here we show that the ECRG4 gene is widely expressed in human tissues and report that its core promoter lies between the − 780 to + 420 base pairs relative to the ATG start codon of the ECRG4 open reading frame. This sequence, which contains several CpG islands, also includes multiple overlapping Sp1 consensus binding sequences and a putative binding site for NF-kB activation. 5′RACE of mRNA derived from human leukocytes shows that ECRG4 transcription initiates from the guanidine at − 11 from the initiation ATG of the ECRG4 open reading frame. While there is no canonical TATA- or CAAT-boxes proximal to this translational initiation site, there is a distal TATA-sequence in the 5′UTR. This region was identified as the sequence targeted by hypermethylation because in vitro methylation of plasmids encoding the ECRG4 promoter abolish promoter activity and the treatment of Jurkat cells (which naturally express ECRG4) with the methylation inhibitor 5-AzaC, increases endogenous ECRG4 expression. Because ChIP assays show that Sp1 binds the ECRG4 promoter, that forced Sp1 expression trans-activates the ECRG4 promoter and Sp1 inhibition with mithramycin inhibits ECRG4 expression, we conclude that the dynamic positive and negative regulatory elements controlling ECRG4 expression include a counter regulation between promoter methylation and Sp1 activation. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Both c-Met and VEGFR-2 are important targets for cancer therapies. Here we report a series of potent dual c-Met and VEGFR-2 inhibitors bearing thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold. The cell proliferation assay in vitro demonstrated that most target compounds had inhibition potency both on c-Met and VEGFR-2 with IC50 values in nanomolar range, especially compound 12j and 12m. Based on the further enzyme assay in vitro, compound 12j was considered as the most potent one, the IC50 values of which were 25 nM and 48 nM for c-Met and VEGFR-2, respectively. Following that, we docked the compound 12j with the proteins c-Met and VEGFR-2, and interpreted the SAR of these analogues. All the results indicate that 12j is a dual inhibitors of c-Met and VEGFR-2 that holds promising potential. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 is a constitutively activated oncogenic protein in various human tumors and represents a valid target for anticancer drug design. In this study, we have achieved a new type of STAT3 inhibitors based on structural modifications on shikonin scaffold, guided by computational modelling. By tests, PMMB-187 exhibited a more outstanding profile than shikonin on a small panel of human breast cancer cells, especially for the MDA-MB-231 cells. For the cellular mechanisms research, PMMB-187 was found to induce cell apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, associated with the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, production of ROS and alteration of the levels of apoptosis-related proteins. Furthermore, PMMB-187 inhibited constitutive/inducible STAT3 activation, transcriptional activity, nuclear translocation and downstream target genes expression in STAT3-dependent breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. Besides, no obvious inhibitory effect on activation of STAT1 and STAT5 was observed with PMMB-187 treatment. Most notably, the in vivo studies further revealed that PMMB-187 could dramatically suppress the MDA-MB-231 cells xenografted tumor growth. The in vitro and in vivo results collectively suggest that PMMB-187 may serve as a promising lead compound for the further development of potential therapeutic anti-neoplastic agents. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Oncolytic viruses are an emerging class of cancer therapeutics that couple cytotoxicity with the induction of an anti-tumor immune response. Host-virus interactions are complex and modulated by a tumor microenvironment whose immunosuppressive activities can limit the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies. In an effort to improve this aspect of oncolytic virotherapy, we combined the oncolytic herpes virus HSV1716 with the transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGF-βR1) inhibitor A8301 to treat syngeneic models of murine rhabdomyosarcoma. Mice that received HSV1716 or A8301 alone showed little to no benefit in efficacy and survival over controls. Conversely, mice given combination therapy exhibited tumor stabilization throughout the treatment regimen, which was reflected in significantly prolonged survival times including some complete responses. In vitro cell viability and virus replication assays showed that the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines were generally insensitive to HSV1716 and A8301. Likewise, in vivo virus replication assays showed that HSV1716 titers moderately decreased in the presence of A8301. The enhanced efficacy instead appears to be dependent on the generation of an improved anti-tumor T cell response as determined by its loss in athymic nude mice and following in vivo depletion of either CD4+ or CD8+ cells. These data suggest TGF-β inhibition can augment the immunotherapeutic efficacy of oncolytic herpes virotherapy. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Modified measles virus (MV) has effective oncolytic activity preclinically and is currently being investigated in clinical trials for various types of cancer. We investigated the use of cystine knot proteins (CKPs) to direct MV activity. CKPs are short polypeptides that bind their targets with high affinity. We used a CKP that binds αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 integrins with single-digit nanomolar affinity to retarget MV to the integrins (MV-CKPint). MV-CKPint infected, replicated in, and killed human glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), and melanoma cancer cells in vitro, all of which express the target integrins. MV-CKPint activity was competitively blocked by echistatin, an integrin binding peptide. When the CKP was cleaved from the viral H protein at an included protease site, virus activity was abrogated. When delivered intravenously (i.v.), the retargeted virus reached a subcutaneous glioblastoma tumor bed and produced cytopathic effects similar to that shown by intratumoral injection of the virus. Because these target integrins are overexpressed by tumor vascular endothelium, MV-CKPint may allow for effective therapy with i.v. injection. These results indicate for the first time that CKPs can be used to retarget MV for a receptor of choice. In addition, MV-CKPint provides proof of principle for the use of a CKP of interest to retarget any enveloped virus for both oncolytic and gene therapy purposes. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Germline RB1 mutations strongly predispose humans to cone precursor–derived retinoblastomas and strongly predispose mice to pituitary tumors, yet shared cell type–specific circuitry that sensitizes these different cell types to the loss of RB1 has not been defined. Here we show that the cell type–restricted thyroid hormone receptor isoform TRb2 sensitizes to RB1 loss in both settings by antagonizing the widely expressed and tumor-suppressive TRb1. TRb2 promoted expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2, a critical factor for RB1-mutant tumors, by enabling EMI1/FBXO5–dependent inhibition of SKP2 degradation. In RB1 wild-type neuroblastoma cells, endogenous Rb or ectopic TRb2 was required to sustain SKP2 expression as well as cell viability and proliferation. These results suggest that in certain contexts, Rb loss enables TRb1-dependent suppression of SKP2 as a safeguard against RB1-deficient tumorigenesis. TRb2 counteracts TRb1, thus disrupting this safeguard and promoting development of RB1-deficient malignancies. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we describe the use of the rule of 3 fragment-based strategies from biochemical screening data of 1100 in-house, small, low molecular weight fragments. The sequential combination of in silico fragment hopping and fragment linking based on S160/Y161/A162 hinge residues hydrogen bonding interactions leads to the identification of novel 1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-1H-indazol class of Phosphoinositide-Dependent Kinase-1 (PDK1) inhibitors. Consequent SAR and follow-up screening data led to the discovery of two potent PDK1 inhibitors: compound 32 and 35, with an IC50 of 80 nM and 94 nM, respectively. Further biological evaluation showed that, at the low nanomolar concentration, the drug had potent ability to inhibit phosphorylation of AKT and p70S6, and selectively kill the cancer cells with mutations in both PTEN and PI3K. The microarray data showed that DUSP6, DUSP4, and FOSL1 were down-regulated in the sensitive cell lines with the compound treatment. The in vivo test showed that 35 can significantly inhibit tumor growth without influencing body weight growth.

    "Abstract": "Acrocomia totai Mart (“macaúba”) is a palm tree native from Brazil, whose potential for biodiesel production has been widely explored. In spite of the industrial interest in the oil from the nuts, little is known about the potential applications of other parts of the plant, especially in the pharmacological area. A phytochemical study of the plant thorns led to the identification of a new compound 3-(R)-methoxy-21-(R)-H-hop-22(29)-en-30-ol 1, two known triterpenes 2–3, four steroids 4–7 and a stilbene, piceatannol 8. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses, including 1D and 2D NMR and low and high resolution mass spectrometry. Compound 1 was purified as crystals, which allowed the determination of the absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbons by analysis of the X-ray diffraction spectrum. Biological tests were performed with crude extract (CE), fractions and isolated compound. The assays showed activity for CE against lung carcinoma (GI50 59.2 μg mL−1). The ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) showed efficacy against many tumor cell lines, and the tests showed the most prominent activity for breast cancer (GI50 10.4 μg mL−1), glioma (GI50 77.3 μg mL−1), uterine cervix (SiHa) HPV 16 (IC50 39.8 μg mL−1), (HeLa) HPV 18 (IC50 12.0 μg mL−1) and Caco-2 (IC50 40.0 μg mL−1) and showed bacteriostatic action against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 50 μg mL−1). Piceatannol 8 isolated from EAF showed activity against the protozoan which causes leishmaniosis (IC50 58.4 μg mL−1). For Trypanosoma cruzi, the methanol fraction (EC50 15.5 μg mL−1), CE (20.5 μg mL−1), and HEF (43.8 μg mL−1) were the most active, being highly selective for the protozoan and less toxic against Vero cells. The compound 8 was further tested against Zika virus MR 766 strain on MOI 2, however the assays showed no inhibition against virus infection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Chemical fate is a concern at environmentally contaminated sites, but characterizing that fate can be difficult. Identifying and quantifying the movement of chemicals at the air-water interface are important steps in characterizing chemical fate. Superfund sites are often suspected sources of air pollution due to legacy sediment and water contamination. A quantitative assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated PAH (OPAHs) diffusive flux in a river system that contains a Superfund Mega-site, and passes through residential, urban and agricultural land, has not been reported before. Here, passive sampling devices (PSDs) were used to measure 60 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 22 oxygenated PAH (OPAHs) in air and water. From these concentrations the magnitude and direction of contaminant flux between these two compartments was calculated. The magnitude of PAH flux was greater at sites near or within the Superfund Mega-site than outside of the Superfund Mega-site. The largest net individual PAH deposition at a single site was naphthalene at a rate of − 14,200 (± 5780) (ng/m2)/day. The estimated one-year total flux of phenanthrene was − 7.9 × 105 (ng/m2)/year. Human health risk associated with inhalation of vapor phase PAHs and dermal exposure to PAHs in water were assessed by calculating benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentrations. Excess lifetime cancer risk estimates show potential increased risk associated with exposure to PAHs at sites within and in close proximity to the Superfund Mega-site. Specifically, estimated excess lifetime cancer risk associated with dermal exposure and inhalation of PAHs was above 1 in 1 million within the Superfund Mega-site. The predominant depositional flux profile observed in this study suggests that the river water in this Superfund site is largely a sink for airborne PAHs, rather than a source. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) is a frequently used modality for cancer treatment. Acute and/or chronic skin changes may occur and carry risk of influencing quality of life during and after completion of RT. Radiation reactions may lead to delays in treatment, diminished cosmesis, and functional deficits. Lifestyle factors, treatment modalities, topical agents, and, in some cases, wound dressings may be utilized to help prevent or ameliorate radiation-induced skin reactions. While rigorous evidence supporting specific interventions may be lacking or contradictory, this article summarizes the current knowledge of the etiology, manifestations, and interventions available for prevention and management of radiation dermatitis. Further well-designed studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of current recommendations and facilitate development of novel strategies for optimal care of patients with radiation dermatitis.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: AZD1775, a first-in-class, small-molecule inhibitor of the Wee1 tyrosine kinase, is under evaluation as a potential chemo- and radiosensitizer for treating glioblastoma. This study was to prospectively, quantitatively, and mechanistically investigate the penetration of AZD1775 across the human blood-brain barrier (BBB). Experimental Design: AZD1775 plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 20 patients with glioblastoma. The drug metabolism, transcellular passive permeability, and interactions with efflux and uptake transporters were determined using human derived in vitro systems. A whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model integrated with a fourcompartment permeability-limited brain model was developed for predicting the kinetics of AZD1775 BBB penetration and assessing the factors modulating this process. Results: AZD1775 exhibited good tumor penetration in patients with glioblastoma, with the unbound tumor-to-plasma concentration ratio ranging from 1.3 to 24.4 (median, 3.2). It was a substrate for ABCB1, ABCG2, and OATP1A2, but not for OATP2B1 or OAT3. AZD1775 transcellular passive permeability and active efflux clearance across MDCKII-ABCB1 or MDCKII-ABCG2 cell monolayers were dependent on the basolateral pH. The PBPK model well predicted observed drug plasma and tumor concentrations in patients. The extent and rate of drug BBB penetration were influenced by BBB integrity, efflux and uptake active transporter activity, and drug binding to brain tissue. Conclusions: In the relatively acidic tumor microenvironment where ABCB1/ABCG2 transporter-mediated efflux clearance is reduced, OATP1A2-mediated active uptake becomes dominant, driving AZD1775 penetration into brain tumor. Variations in the brain tumor regional pH, transporter expression/ activity, and BBB integrity collectively contribute to the heterogeneity of AZD1775 penetration into brain tumors. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "mRNA splicing and export plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression, with recent evidence suggesting an additional layer of regulation of gene expression and cellular function through the selective splicing and export of genes within specific pathways. Here we describe a role for the RNA processing factors THRAP3 and BCLAF1 in the regulation of the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, a key pathway involved in the maintenance of genomic stability and the prevention of oncogenic transformation. We show that loss of THRAP3 and/or BCLAF1 leads to sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, defective DNA repair and genomic instability. Additionally, we demonstrate that this phenotype can be at least partially explained by the role of THRAP3 and BCLAF1 in the selective mRNA splicing and export of transcripts encoding key DDR proteins, including the ATM kinase. Moreover, we show that cancer associated mutations within THRAP3 result in deregulated processing of THRAP3/BCLAF1- regulated transcripts and consequently defective DNA repair. Taken together, these results suggest that THRAP3 and BCLAF1 mutant tumors may be promising targets for DNA damaging chemotherapy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The age of onset of endometrial carcinoma has been decreasing in recent years. In endometrial carcinoma, it is important to accurately assess invasion depth and preoperative staging. Fusion of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) may contribute to the improvement of anatomical localization of lesions. Materials and methods: In our study, a total of 58 endometrial carcinoma cases were included. Based on the revised 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system, a fusion of T2WI and DWI was utilized for the evaluation of invasion depth and determination of the overall stage. Postoperative pathologic assessment was considered as the reference standard. The consistency of T2WI image staging and pathologic staging, and the consistency of fused T2WI and DWI and pathologic staging were all analyzed using Kappa statistics. Results: Compared with the T2WI group, a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy was observed for myometrial invasion with fusion of T2WI and DWI (77.6% for T2WI; 94.8% for T2WI-DWI). For the identification of deep invasion, we calculated values for diagnostic sensitivity (69.2% for T2WI; 92.3% for T2WI-DWI), specificity (80% for T2WI; 95.6% for T2WI-DWI), positive predictive value (50% for T2WI; 85.7% for T2WI-DWI), and negative predictive value (90% for T2WI; 97.7% for T2WI-DWI). In summary, T2WI-DWI fusion exhibits higher diagnostic accuracy with respect to staging relative to T2WI only (81.0% for T2WI; 94.8% for T2WI-DWI). Conclusion: Fused T2WI-DWI may represent a noninvasive, lower cost approach for the effective assessment of myometrial invasion and staging of endometrial carcinoma. © 2017 Guo et al.",

    "Abstract": "The ubiquitin proteasome system is widely postulated to be a new and important field of drug discovery for the future, with the ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs) representing one of the more attractive target classes within the area. Many USPs have been linked to critical axes for therapeutic intervention, and the finding that USP28 is required for c-Myc stability suggests that USP28 inhibition may represent a novel approach to targeting this so far undruggable oncogene. Here, we describe the discovery of the first reported inhibitors of USP28, which we demonstrate are able to bind to and inhibit USP28, and while displaying a dual activity against the closest homologue USP25, these inhibitors show a high degree of selectivity over other deubiquitinases (DUBs). The utility of these compounds as valuable probes to investigate and further explore cellular DUB biology is highlighted by the demonstration of target engagement against both USP25 and USP28 in cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these inhibitors are able to elicit modulation of both the total levels and the half-life of the c-Myc oncoprotein in cells and also induce apoptosis and loss of cell viability in a range of cancer cell lines. We however observed a narrow therapeutic index compared to a panel of tissue-matched normal cell lines. Thus, it is hoped that these probes and data presented herein will further advance our understanding of the biology and tractability of DUBs as potential future therapeutic targets. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "T cell-based immunotherapies are a promising approach for patients with advanced cancers. However, various obstacles limit T-cell efficacy, including suboptimal T-cell receptor (TCR) activation and an immunosuppressive tumor environment. Here, we developed a fusion protein by linking CD8α and MyD88 (CD8α: MyD88) to enhance CD8 + T-cell responses to weakly immunogenic and poorly expressed tumor antigens. CD8α: MyD88-engineered T cells exhibited increased proliferation and expression of effector and costimulatory molecules in a tumor antigen-dependent manner. These effects were accompanied by elevated activation of TCR and Toll-like receptor signaling-related proteins. CD8α: MyD88-expressing T cells improved antitumor responses in mice. Enhanced antitumor activity was associated with a unique tumor cytokine/chemokine signature, improved T-cell infiltration, reduced markers of T-cell exhaustion, elevated levels of proteins associated with antigen presentation, and fewer macrophages with an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumors. Given these observations, CD8α: MyD88 represents a unique and versatile approach to help overcome immunosuppression and enhance T-cell responses to tumor antigens. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the RUNX1 gene have been associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes. However, the underlying mechanisms connecting RUNX1 to the success of therapy remain elusive. Here we explore the hypothesis that RUNX1 is directly involved in the response of hematopoietic cells to cytotoxic agents. RUNX1 was upregulated posttranscriptionally by cytotoxic agents in C57BL/6 mice in vivo and hematopoietic cell lines. Upregulation was also seen in primary human AML cells after treatment with cytarabine in vitro. Upon overexpression, RUNX1 restricted proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and augmented the DNA damage response. This unknown activity of RUNX1 required an intact runt homology domain (RHD), a domain where most leukemia-associated point mutations cluster. Consistent with this, two RHDdefective RUNX1 proteins lacked any antiproliferative or apoptotic activity, and RHD-defective (K83N, N109D) mutant RUNX1 conferred resistance to ionizing radiation when overexpressed in Ba/F3 cells under certain conditions. Our experiments reveal a novel function of RUNX1 and offer an explanation for the link between RUNX1 mutations and chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Moreover, these data suggest that pharmacologic modulation of RUNX1 might be an attractive new approach to treat hematologic malignancies. © 2017 AACR.",

    "Abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates growth, proliferation and survival. Dysregulation of IGF pathway contributes to the initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer and is also involved in diseases of glucose metabolism, such as diabetes. We have identified Ubiquilin1 (UBQLN1) as a novel interaction partner of IGF1R, IGF2R and insulin receptor (INSR). UBQLN family of proteins have been studied primarily in the context of protein quality control and in the field of neurodegenerative disorders. Our laboratory discovered a link between UBQLN1 function and tumorigenesis, such that UBQLN1 is lost and underexpressed in 50% of human lung adenocarcinoma cases. We demonstrate here that UBQLN1 regulates the expression and activity of IGF1R. Following loss of UBQLN1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells, there is accelerated loss of IGF1R. Despite decreased levels of total receptors, the ratio of active : Total receptors is higher in cells that lack UBQLN1. UBQLN1 also regulates INSR and IGF2R post-stimulation with ligand. We conclude that UBQLN1 is essential for normal regulation of IGF receptors. UBQLN-1-deficient cells demonstrate increased cell viability compared with control when serum-starved and stimulation of IGF pathway in these cells increased their migratory potential by 3-fold. As the IGF pathway is involved in processes of normal growth, development, metabolism and cancer progression, understanding its regulation by Ubiquilin1 can be of tremendous value to many disciplines. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To investigate predictors of occult nipple-areolar complex (NAC) involvement in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and to validate an online probability calculator (CancerMath; www.lifemath.net/cancer/breastcancer/nipplecalc/index.php). Methods: Mastectomized patients with CIS (n = 104) were retrospectively selected. Clinicopathology and preoperative mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analyzed. Results: Histopathological NAC-positivity was confirmed in 20 (19.2%) patients. Short nipple-tumor distance and suspicious extension to the nipple by mammography were significant but ultrasound was not significant to predict NAC involvement. NAC-positive cases had MRI findings of shorter nipple-tumor distance in both the early and delayed phases. Multivariable regression model showed age >50 years and shorter tumor-nipple distance on the delay phase of MRI were statistically significant predictors of NAC involvement. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was 0.618 when calculated by CancerMath; however, an AUC of 0.954 was achieved when distance and age were applied together as predictor. Conclusions: Mammographic and MRI findings were significant for predicting NAC involvement, with distance of the tumor from the nipple in delay phase MRI the most significant predictor of NAC involvement. Therefore, breast MRI could be beneficial for planning nipple-sparing mastectomy in patients with CIS. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: While preoperative treatment is frequently administered to CRLM patients, the impact of chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, on liver regeneration remains controversial. Methods: The early and late regeneration indexes were defined as the relative increase in liver volume (RLV) within 2 and 9 months from surgery. Regeneration rates of the preoperative treatment groups were compared. Results: Preoperative chemotherapy details and volumetric data were available for 185 patients; 78 (42.2%) received preoperative chemotherapy with bevacizumab (Bev+), 46 (24.8%) received chemotherapy only (Bev−), and 61 (33%) received no chemotherapy. Patients in the Bev+ and Bev− groups received similar chemotherapy cycles (4 [3-6] vs 4 [4-6]; P = 0.499). Despite the comparable clinicopathological characteristics and Resected Volume/Total Liver Volume (TLV) at surgery (P = 0.944) of both groups, Bev+ group had higher early and late regeneration (17.2% vs 4.3%; P = 0.035 and 14.0% vs 9.4%; P = 0.091, respectively). Of note, early and late regeneration rates (3.7% and 10.9% vs 6.6% and 5.5%, respectively) were comparable between the no chemotherapy and Bev− groups (all P > 0.05). In multivariable analysis —adjusted for gender, age, portal vein embolization, preoperative chemotherapy, resected liver volume, tumor number, postoperative chemotherapy, fibrosis, steatosis— bevacizumab independently predicted early liver regeneration (P = 0.019). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that preoperative bevacizumab administered along with chemotherapy was associated with enhanced volumetric restoration. Interestingly, this effect was more pronounced among patients who received oxaliplatin-based regimens and bevacizumab compared to those treated with irinotecan-based regimens and bevacizumab. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In order to discover the novel anti-tumor agents, a series of 2-[(pyridin-2-yl)methylthio]- 1H-benzimidazole derivatives were designed and synthesized, and the structures were characterized by IR, MS, and proton NMR. 2-[(3,4-Dimethoxypyridin-2-yl)methylthio]-1Hbenzimidazole was investigated with X-ray crystallography, and the molecule is in orthorhombic system, space group P212121, with a = 9.1828(16), b = 11.625(2), c = 13.463(2) Å, Z = 4, R = 0.0231 and wR = 0.0596. The antitumor activities of target compounds were evaluated against human liver cancer cell line HepG2, and human liver normal cell line HL7702 using MTT assay. The target compounds have demonstrated weak or moderate anti-tumor activity against HepG2, while all the target compounds exhibit no cytotoxic effects on HL7702.",

    "Abstract": "The ever-increasing pace of development of novel therapies mandates efficient methodologies for assessment of their tolerability and activity. Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional rule-based designs such as the 3+3 but despite this, their use remains limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP), which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay, escalate, deescalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties, we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In particular, it can help to determinehowstringent the stopping rules should be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown, complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transitionfor each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs by statisticians and investigators. ©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gliomas are the most common primary tumors in central nervous system. The prognosis of the patients with glioma is poor regardless of the development of therapeutic strategies. Its aggressive behavior mainly depends on the potent ability of proliferation. The transcription factor EGR1 (early growth response 1) is a member of a zinc finger transcription factor family which plays an essential role in cell growth and proliferation. Methods: EGR1 expression levels in 39 glioma tissues and 10 normal brain tissues were tested by RT-qPCR and Western-blotting. The effects of EGR1 on U251 cells, U251 stem-like cells (GSCs), and U87 cells proliferation were assessed using in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation assays. The specific binding between EGR1 and CCND1 promoter was confirmed by CHIP assay. EGF was used to improve EGR1 expression in this assay. Results: EGR1 expression levels in human gliomas are decreased compared with normal brain tissues, however, the patients with low EGR1 expression level showed significantly enhanced patient survival in all glioma patients. EGR1 silencing inhibited proliferation and induced G1 phase arrest in glioma cells. EGR1 contributed to proliferation by directly raising CCND1. Meanwhile, EGR1 overexpression induced by EGF was able to promote the proliferation of glioma cells. Conclusions: Our results show that stable knockdown EGR1 would inhibit glioma proliferation. The results suggest EGR1 showing lower expression in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues maybe still play an important role in tumor proliferation. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity plays a pivotal role in cancer immune surveillance. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) is a protein receptor mainly expressed in activated T cells and regulatory T cells. CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for ligand binding and generates inhibitory signals to attenuate T cell activation. The blockade of CTLA-4 mediated immune inhibitory checkpoint has been associated with enhanced anti-tumor immunity. In this study, we use CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock out (KO) CTLA-4 from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and evaluate its effect on the anti-tumor activity of the CTLs. CTLA-4 KO CTLs robustly enhanced tumor cell death by 40% compared to the control and facilitated apoptosis and caspase activities in tumor cells. The knockout of CTLA-4 also increased TNF-α and IFN-γ secretion of the CTLs by approximately 2-fold. The effectiveness of CTLA-4 KO in enhancing anti-tumor activity of the CTLs was verified in vivo using mouse xenograft model. The xenografted mice treated with CTLA-4 KO CTLs demonstrated repressed tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to the control group. Our data suggest that CRISPR targeting CTLA-4 immune checkpoint could significantly improve the anti-tumor activity of CTLs. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Emetine is a small molecule protein synthesis inhibitor that is toxic to all cell types and therefore suitable for complete killing of all types of heterogeneous cancer cells within a tumor. It becomes significantly inactive (non-toxic) when derivatized at its N-2′ secondary amine. This provides a strategy for targeting emetine to cancerous tumor without killing normal cells. In this report, PSA activatable peptide prodrugs of emetine were synthesized. To overcome steric hindrances and enhance protease specific cleavage, a 2-stage prodrug activation process was needed to release emetine in cancer cells. In this 2-stage process, emetine prodrug intermediates are coupled to PSA peptide substrate (Ac-His-Ser-Ser-Lys-Leu-Gln) to obtain the full prodrug. Both prodrug intermediates 10 (Ala-Pro-PABC-Emetine) and 14 (Ser-Leu-PABC-Emetine) were evaluated for kinetics of hydrolysis to emetine and potency [Where PABC = p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl]. While both intermediates quantitatively liberate emetine when incubated under appropriate conditions, upon coupling of PSA substrate to give the full prodrugs, only prodrug 16, the prodrug obtained from 14 was hydrolyzable by PSA. Cytotoxicity studies in PSA producing LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 confirm the activation of the prodrug by PSA with an IC50 of 75 nM and 59 nM respectively. The cytotoxicity of 16 is significantly reduced in cell lines that do not produce PSA. Further, in vivo toxicity studies are done on these prodrugs and other derivatives of emetine. The results show the significance of conformational modulation in obtaining safe emetine prodrugs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "A novel form of carbon dots (PEG-CDs) was prepared by using one-step hydrothermal synthesis with glycine as the precursor and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-2000 as the surface modifier. The prepared PEG-CDs were characterized with HRTEM, XRD, PL, FTIR and UV. The results showed that they were quasi spherical particles with a diameter of approximately 12 nm and had a fine fluorescence property, good water solubility, favorable stability and high quantum yield with 28.58%. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) as a potential anti-cancer drug was loaded on the PEG-CDs. The drug loading capacity was 24.25 mg/g and the encapsulation efficiency was 77.23% at pH 9.0 with 36 h of dialysis; DOX release in PBS system with a pH of 5.5 could reach up to 76.67% in 23 h. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: PTEN-null tumors become dependent on the PI3Kb isoform and can be targeted by molecules such as the selective PI3Kb inhibitor AZD8186. However, beyond the modulation of the canonical PI3K pathway, the consequences of inhibiting PI3Kb are poorly defined. Experimental Design: To determine the broader impact of AZD8186 in PTEN-null tumors, we performed a genome-wide RNA-seq analysis of PTEN-null triple-negative breast tumor xenografts treated with AZD8186. Mechanistic consequences of AZD8186 treatment were examined across a number of PTENnull cell lines and tumor models. Results: AZD8186 treatment resulted in modification of transcript and protein biomarkers associated with cell metabolism. We observed downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes and upregulation of markers associated with metabolic stress. Downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis proteins, such as HMGCS1, occurred in PTEN-null cell lines and tumor xenografts sensitive to AZD8186. Therapeutic inhibition of PI3Kβ also upregulated PDHK4 and increased PDH phosphorylation, indicative of reduced carbon flux into the TCA cycle. Consistent with this, metabolomic analysis revealed a number of changes in key carbon pathways, nucleotide, and amino acid biosynthesis. Conclusions: This study identifies novel mechanistic biomarkers of PI3Kβ inhibition in PTEN-null tumors supporting the concept that targeting PI3Kb may exploit a metabolic dependency that contributes to therapeutic benefit in inducing cell stress. Considering these additional pathways will guide biomarker and combination strategies for this class of agents. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "CD8+/CD103+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) accumulate in several human solid tumors, where they have been associated with a favorable prognosis.However, the role of CD103, the α subunit of the integrin αEβ7 (also known as CD103), in the retention and functions of these TRM is undefined. In this report, we investigated the role of CD103 cytoplasmic domain and the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin (Pxn) in downstream signaling and functional activities triggered through αE/CD103 chain. Binding to immobilized recombinant (r)E-cadherin-Fc of CD103 integrin expressed on tumor-specific CTL clones promotes phosphorylation of Pxn and Pyk2 and binding of Pxn to the αE/CD103 subunit tail. Inhibition of Pxn phosphorylation by the Src inhibitor saracatinib or its knockdown via shRNA dramatically altered adhesion and spreading of freshly isolated CD8+/CD103+ lung tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes and CD103+ tumor-specific CTL clones. Inhibition of Pxn phosphorylation with saracatinib in these CTL clones also severely compromised their functional activities toward autologous tumor cells. Using Jurkat T cells as a model to study CD103 integrin activation, we demonstrated a key role of serine residue S1163 of the αE chain intracellular domain in polarization of CD103 and recruitment of lysosomes and Pxn at the contact zone of T lymphocytes with rE-cadherin-Fc-coated beads. Overall, our results show how Pxn binding to the CD103 cytoplasmic tail triggers αEβ7 integrin outside-in signaling that promotes CD8+ T-cell migratory behavior and effector functions. These results also explain the more favorable prognosis associated with retention of TRM cells in the tumor microenvironment. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Development of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy continues to be a serious clinical problem in Lung adenocarcinoma management. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists demonstrate anti-tumor activity likely via transactivating genes that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Efatutazone, a novel later generation PPARγ agonist, selectively activates PPARγ target genes and has antiproliferative effects in a range of malignancies. However, the exact function and molecular mechanism of PPARγ agonists efatutazone in EGFR-TKI gefitinib-resistance of Lung adenocarcinoma has not been determined. In this study, we studied the development of acquired resistance to an EGFR-TKI gefitinib in lung adenocarcinoma cells and investigated the antiproliferative effects of efatutazone in the acquired resistant cells. The treatment of gefitinib-resistant cells with efatutazone reduced the growth of gefitinib-resistant cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and facilitated the anti-proliferative effects of gefitinib. Mechanistic investigations suggested that efatutazone acted by upregulating protein expression of PPARγ, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), inactivating the Akt pathway, followed by dephosphorylation of p21Cip1 at Thr145 without affecting the transcriptional levels. Our results suggested that efatutazone, alone or in combination with gefitinib, might offer therapeutic effects in lung adenocarcinoma. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "We have established a protocol for the preparation of permeabilized fission yeast cells (enzyme bags) that recombinantly express human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). A direct comparison of CYP3A4 activity gave an eightfold higher space-time yield for enzyme bag-catalyzed biotransformation as compared to whole-cell biotransformation, even though the total number of cells employed was lower by a factor of 150. Biotransformation of the luminogenic substrate Luciferin-H using CYP2C9-containing enzyme bags proceeded efficiently and stably for 24 h. CYP4Z1 is of interest because it is strongly overexpressed both in breast cancer cells and in breast cancer metastases; however, current knowledge about its catalytic properties is very limited. Screening of CYP4Z1-containing enzyme bags with 15 luminogenic substrates enabled us to identify two new hydroxylations and eleven ether cleavage reactions that are catalyzed by CYP4Z1. By far the best substrate found in this study was Luciferin benzyl ether (Luciferin-BE). On the basis of the recently published crystal structure of CYP4B1 we created a new homology model of CYP4Z1 and performed molecular docking experiments, which indicate that all active substrates show a highly similar binding geometry compared to the endogenous substrates. The model predicts that Ser113, Ser222, Asn381, and Ser383 are key hydrogen bonding residues. We also identified five new inhibitors of CYP4Z1: miconazole, econazole, aminobenzotriazole, tolazoline, and 1-benzylimidazole respectively, with the last compound being the most potent giving an IC50 value of 180 nM in our test system. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: BCR-ABL+ B-ALL leukemic cells are highly dependent on the expression of endogenous antiapoptotic MCL-1 to promote viability and are resistant to BH3-mimetic agents such as navitoclax (ABT-263) that target BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W. However, the survival of most normal blood cells and other cell types is also dependent on Mcl-1. Despite the requirement for MCL-1 in these cell types, initial reports of MCL-1-specific BH3- mimetics have not described any overt toxicities associated with single-agent use, but these agents are still early in clinical development. Therefore, we sought to identify approved drugs that could sensitize leukemic cells to ABT-263. Experimental Design: A screen identified dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a water-soluble metabolite of the antimalarial artemisinin. Using mouse and human leukemic cell lines, and primary patient-derived xenografts, the effect of DHA on survival was tested, and mechanistic studies were carried out to discover how DHA functions. We further tested in vitro and in vivo whether combining DHA with ABT-263 could enhance the response of leukemic cells to combination therapy. Results: DHA causes the downmodulation of MCL-1 expression by triggering a cellular stress response that represses translation. The repression of MCL-1 renders leukemic cells highly sensitive to synergistic cell death induced by ABT-263 in a mouse model of BCR-ABL+ B-ALL both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, DHA synergizes with ABT-263 in human Ph+ ALL cell lines, and primary patient-derived xenografts of Ph+ ALL in culture. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that combining DHA with ABT-263 can improve therapeutic response in BCR-ABL+ B-ALL. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Deregulation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway has been documented in colorectal cancer (CRC). Previously, we investigated possible associations between urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) deficiency and expression of extracellular constituents of BMP signaling in a newly developed mouse model of inflammation-driven intestinal neoplasmatogenesis, in which chronic colitis and CRC are induced using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). In this report, we explored the contribution of intracellular components of Smad-mediated BMP signal transduction using the same model. Interestingly, upon DSS treatment, we noticed an overexpression of Runx1/2/3 transcription factors in both wild-type and uPA-deficient mice. Moreover, Runx1 and Runx2 expression levels exhibited an even higher increase in DSS-treated/uPA-deficient mice as compared to DSS-treated/wild-type animals. In all experimental conditions, in situ investigation of Runx-expressing cell types, revealed detection of all three Runx in the immune cells, yet in the DSS-treated/uPA-deficient mice Runx1 and Runx2 were also identified in the preneoplastic epithelium of advanced high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma in-situ colonic lesions. Finally, the uPA-deficient pro-tumorigenic colitic microenvironment exhibited increased levels of the Runx-induced target genes Snai2, Bim and Claudin1, known to have a role in tumor development and progression. These findings suggest that the absence of uPA correlates with increased levels of Runx transcriptional regulators in a way that promotes inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

Methods: Two-hundred ninety-two patients who previously underwent radical prostatectomy were retrospectively selected for a case-control study, excluding those with anastomotic strictures and significant perioperative complications and re-called for a medical follow-up visit after their consent to participate the study. They were divided in 3 different groups according to the surgical technique previously received: radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) combined with bladder neck preservation (BNP), RARP with bladder neck resection, and RARP combined with BNP and posterior musculofascial reconstruction (PRec). Functional and oncologic outcomes evaluation were integrated by a questionnaire on urinary continence status, abdominal ultrasound scan, uroflowmetry and post-void urine volume measurement. Urinary continence definition included the terms \"no pad\" or \"safety pad\". Results: Two hundred thirty-two patients responded to the phone call interview and were enrolled in the study. They presented comparable age, prostate volume and BMI. Differences in comorbidities, ASA score and medications, did not influence the postoperative functional results, focused on continence outcome. Early urinary continence was achieved in 49.38% and 24.73% of patients who previously underwent RARP + BNP + PRec and simple RARP respectively (p = 0.000)as well as late 12-months urinary continence was obtained in 92.59% and 79.56% of patients.(p = 0.01). Late urinary continence in the RRP + BNP group was comparable to the result obtained in the simple RARP group. The potential effects of nerve sparing technique on urinary continence have not been evaluated. Conclusions: The combined technique of RARP + BNP + PRec seems to be effective to determine early and long term significant effects on urinary continence of patients with comparable body mass index, age and prostate volume. No statistically significant differences were found between the simple RARP and the RRP + BNP groups. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nodal is a growth factor expressed during early embryonic development, but reactivated in several advanced-stage cancers. Targeting of Nodal signaling, which occurs via the binding to Cripto-1 co-receptor, results in inhibition of cell aggressiveness and reduced tumor growth. The Nodal binding region to Cripto-1 was identified and targeted with a high affinity monoclonal antibody (3D1). By STD-NMR technique, we investigated the interaction of Nodal fragments with 3D1 with the aim to elucidate at atomic level the interaction surface. Data indicate with high accuracy the antibody-antigen contact atoms and confirm the information previously obtained by immune-enzymatic methods. Main residues contacted by 3D1 are P46, V47, E49 and E50, which belong to the Nodal loop involved in the interaction with the co-receptor. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide composed of repeating disaccharide units. It has been well documented to play an array of biological functions in cancer events. Here, we reported a sequential one-pot multienzyme (OPME) strategy for in vitro synthesis of HA and its derivatives. The strategy, which combined in situ sugar nucleotides generation with HA chain polymerization, could convert cheap monosaccharides into HA polymers without consuming exogenous sugar nucleotide donors. HA polymers (number-average molecular weight ranged from 1.5 × 104 to 5.5 × 105 Da) with over 70% yields were efficiently synthesized and purified from this one-pot system. More importantly, partial labeled HA derivative was further synthesized by metabolic incorporation of unnatural monosaccharide analogues into the sequential OPME system. Cross-linked HA hydrogel was achieved via copper (I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition and exhibited novel networks consisting of both inter- and intra-connected HA chains, which could facilitate the potential applications of this unique polysaccharide. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Solid tumor includes the areas where oxygen concentration is very low called hypoxia, often in the surrounding areas of necrosis. Hypoxic cells in these areas are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The presence of hypoxia and necrosis enables tumor-selective treatment, including hypoxia-activated prodrugs, tumor hypoxia-specific gene therapy and tumor-targeting bacterial therapy. This article deals with the mathematical formulation of tumor hypoxia-targeting by introducing a decay parameter of oxygen in the model given by Kolobov et al. (2009) and Avila et al. (2013). The well-posedness of the governing partial differential equations and numerical simulation are provided. For the purpose of numerical simulations, the conforming Q1 finite element method for space discretization and second-order diagonally implicit fractional step θ-scheme for temporal discretization are used. The effect of oxygen on hypoxia, necrotic region decay and the maximum age of growing tumor cells are computed and illustrated graphically. It is observed that the distribution of nutrients in tissues have substantial effect on tumor growth rate and structure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Stressors impair immune defenses and pose risks among cancer patients. Natural Killer cells are not the sole immune defense against tumor development. Utilizing an NK-sensitive tumor model, this study evaluated immune effects to stress and determined whether lung metastasis resulted from B cells' inability to augment tumorlytic function. Lung metastasis directly correlated with delayed lung B cell accumulation compared to NK, and T cells. Decreased interleukin-12 cytokine and CD80+ molecule expression by B cells correlated with decreased tumor lysis and increased tumor development. Thus, tumor defenses in the lung given stress exposure can depend on the B cell function. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A novel synthetic protocol has been developed for the synthesis of 1,4-benzoxazinone-acetylphenylallyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one hybrids 7a–n by employing Pd-catalyzed C[sbnd]H arylation in presence of 5–10% phosphine ligand in good to excellent yields and evaluated for their anti-proliferative activity against three cancer cell lines such as A549 (lung), HeLa (cervical), MDA-MB-231 (breast). Compounds 7d, 7f, 7l and 7n exhibited promising anti-proliferative activity with GI50 values ranging from 0.37 to 2.73 µM respectively against A549, HeLa, and MDA-MB-231, while compound 7f showed significant activity against MDA-MB-231 with GI50 value 0.58 µM, 7j showed significant activity against A549 with GI50 value 0.32 µM and 7l showed significant activity against HeLa with GI50 value 0.37 µM. This is the first report on the synthesis and in vitro anti-proliferative evaluation of 1,4-benzoxazinone-acetylphenylallyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one hybrids. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The emphasis of this paper lies in the quantitative estimation of off-site risk to the public from Xi'an Pulsed Reactor (XAPR). Off-site consequence model for XAPR nuclear accident was established, and the meteorology data acquired from XAPR site was used as the input parameter with probabilistic theory. The off-site risk to the public of XAPR's radioactivity release was preliminarily analyzed in application of probabilistic safety assessment at 100m point of XAPR boundary in radioactivity. The results demonstrate that the conditional probabilities of effective dose exceeding 1 mSv and 10 mSv are about 0.652% and 0.0750% respectively in the case of radioactivity release spectrum. The overall frequencies with which individual effective dose 10mSv is exceeded is less than 2.20×10 -9 a -1 , meanwhile the other overall frequency with which individual cancer fatality risk is exceeded is not greater than 1.89×10 -6 a -1 . Accordingly the draft safety goal of XAPR in this research is met from this quantitative risk. Our initial assessment leads to conclude that the off-site risk to the public from XAPR is extremely low and then the high safety characteristic of XAPR is proved. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Nuclear Power Engineering.

    "Abstract": "Reversible detyrosination of a-tubulin is crucial to microtubule dynamics and functions, and defects have been implicated in cancer, brain disorganization, and cardiomyopathies. The identity of the tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (TCP) responsible for detyrosination has remained unclear. We used chemical proteomics with a potent irreversible inhibitor to show that the major brain TCP is a complex of vasohibin-1 (VASH1) with the small vasohibin binding protein (SVBP). VASH1 and its homolog VASH2, when complexed with SVBP, exhibited robust and specific Tyr/Phe carboxypeptidase activity on microtubules. Knockdown of vasohibins or SVBP and/or inhibitor addition in cultured neurons reduced detyrosinated a-tubulin levels and caused severe differentiation defects. Furthermore, knockdown of vasohibins disrupted neuronal migration in developing mouse neocortex. Thus, vasohibin/SVBP complexes represent long-sought TCP enzymes.",

    "Abstract": "Fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from sea cucumber Isostichopus badionotus (FCS-Ib) showed potent anticoagulant activities without selectivity. The present study focused on developing safe FCS-Ib oligomers showing selective inhibition of intrinsic factor Xase (anti-FXase) prepared through partial N-deacetylation–deaminative cleavage. The N-deacetylation degree was regulated by reaction time, controlling the resulting oligomer distribution. Structure analysis confirmed the selectivity of degradation, and 12 high purity fractions with trisaccharide-repeating units were separated. In vitro anticoagulant assays indicated a decrease in molecular weight (Mw) dramatically reduced activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), AT-dependent anti-FIIa and anti-FXa activities, while the oligomers retained potent anti-FXase activity until they fell below 3 kDa. Meanwhile, human FXII activation and platelet aggregation were markedly reduced with decreasing Mw and were moderate when under 12.0 kDa. Thus, fragments of 3–12.0 kDa should be safe and effective as selective inhibitors of intrinsic tenase complex for application as clinical anticoagulants. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Broccoli is a rich source of bioactive compounds. Among them, sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol have attracted a lot of attention, since their consumption is associated with reduced risk of cancer. In this work, the development of an efficient and direct method for the simultaneous determination of sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol in broccoli using UPLC–HRMS/MS is described. The correlation coefficient, and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 0.993, 0.77 mg/L and 2.35 mg/L for sulforaphane and 0.997, 0.42 mg/L, 1.29 mg/L for indole-3-carbinol, respectively. The content of sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol varied between 72 ± 9–304 ± 2 mg and 77 ± 1–117 ± 3 mg per 100 g of fresh florets, respectively. Taking into consideration the differences in cultivar, geography, season and environmental factors, the results agreed with values published in the literature using other techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The oncolytic mutant vesicular stomatitis virus VSVΔ51 achieves robust efficacy in multiple extracranial tumor models. Yet for malignancies of the brain, direct intratumoral infusion of VSVΔ51 causes lethal virus-induced neuropathology. Here, we have developed a novel therapeutic regime that uses peripheral immunization with a single sub-lethal dose of VSVΔ51 to establish an acute anti-viral state that enables the safe intracranial (IC) infusion of an otherwise lethal dose of VSVΔ51 within just 6 hr. Although type I interferons alone appeared insufficient to explain this protective phenotype, serum isolated at early time points from primed animals conferred protection against an IC dose of virus. Adaptive immune populations had minimal contributions. Finally, the therapeutic utility of this novel strategy was demonstrated by peripherally priming and intracranially treating mice bearing aggressive CT2A syngeneic astrocytomas with VSVΔ51. Approximately 25% of animals achieved complete regression of established tumors, with no signs of virus-induced neurological impairment. This approach may harness an early warning system in the brain that has evolved to protect the host against otherwise lethal neurotropic viral infections. We have exploited this protective mechanism to safely and efficaciously treat brain tumors with an otherwise neurotoxic virus, potentially widening the available treatment options for oncolytic virotherapy in the brain. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although PET-scan is an advanced, innovative and widely used method for monitoring patients with different types of cancer diseases, it is important to note that its application in patients with cutaneous melanoma is limited and should be reconsidered. CASE REPORT: To affirm this new statement, we are presenting a case from our clinical practice of a patient with melanoma of the interdigital space (with resected in sano primary melanoma and performed complete lymphadenectomy) that showed locoregional and systemic progression in two months post operation. The PET scan performed within the second h?spitalization (and before the second operation) did not detect the presence of any cutaneous metastases, which were clinically and histologically verified after the second operative procedure. CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests that shortly more reliable and sensitive imaging methods for monitoring patients with cutaneous melanoma should be found. Having in mind that our patient has been operated twice in the area of the primary lesion (as the surgical wound underwent secondary healing), theoretically, the abundant cicatrization could have led to reduced glucose uptake in the surrounded cancerous tissue. Monitoring of a larger number of patients with locoregional metastases and surgical interventions in different locations would shed light on the observations shared by us. © 2017 Georgi Tchernev, Liubomira Victor Popova.",

    "Abstract": "Therapeutic strategies using anti-PD-1-blocking antibodies reported unparalleled effectiveness for melanoma immunotherapy, but deciphering immune responses modulated by anti-PD-1 treatment remains a crucial issue. Here, we analyzed the composition and functions of the large Melan-A-specific Tcell repertoire in the peripheral blood of 9 melanoma patients before and after 2 months of treatment with anti-PD-1. We observed amplification of Melan-A-specific Vß subfamilies undetectable before therapy (thereafter called emerging Vß subfamilies) in responding patients, with a predominant expansion in patients with a complete response. These emerging Vß subfamilies displayed a higher functional avidity for their cognate antigen than Vß subfamilies not amplified upon anti-PD-1 therapy and could be identified by a sustained coexpression of PD-1 and TIGIT receptors. Thus, in addition to the emergence of neoantigen-specific T cells previously documented upon anti-PD-1 therapy, our work describes the emergence of high-avidity Melan-A-specific clonotypes as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Synthesized cyclic perylene diimide, cPDI, showed the binding constant of 6.3 × 106 M−1 with binding number of n = 2 with TA-core as a tetraplex DNA in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 7.4) containing 100 mM KCl using Schatchard analysis and showed a higher preference for tetraplex DNA than for double stranded DNA with over 103 times. CD spectra showed that TA-core induced its antiparallel conformation upon addition of cPDI in the absence or presence of K+ or Na+ ions. The cPDI inhibits the telomerase activity with IC50 of 0.3 µM using TRAP assay which is potential anti-cancer drug with low side effect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Two species of Ganoderma, Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum) and Ganoderma sinense (G. sinense) have been widely used as traditional Chinese herbal medicine for their high medicinal value. Recent studies show that the two species differ in levels of their main active compounds triterpenoids though both have antitumoral effects. An effective and simple analytical method using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to discriminate between the two species is of essential importance for its quality assurance and medicinal value estimation. In this study three penalized logistic regression models, weighted least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), elastic net and weighted fusion, using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy have been explored for the purpose of classification and interpretation. The weighted fusion model incorporating spectral correlation structure allowed an automatic selection of a small number of spectral bands and achieved an excellent overall classification accuracy of 99% in discriminating spectra of G. lucidum from that of G. sinense. Its classification performance was superior to that of the weighted Lasso model and elastic net model. The automatic selection of informative spectral features results in substantial reduction in model complexity and improvement of classification accuracy, and it is particularly helpful for the quantitative interpretations of the major chemical constituents of Ganoderma regarding its anti-cancer effects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Glutamine, glutamate and glutathione are key modulators of excessive oxidative stress in tumor cells. In this study, we developed a rapid and accurate HILIC-MS/MS method to simultaneously determine concentrations of cellular glutamine, glutamate and glutathione. A bared silica HILIC column was employed to analyze these polar metabolites. The LC-MS parameters were optimized to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity. The analysis can be completed within 4 min under optimal conditions. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, and linearity. Intra-day (n = 9) precision was within 2.68–6.24% among QCs. Inter-day precision (n = 3) was below 12.4%. The method accuracy was evaluated by the recovery test, and the accuracy for three analytes were between 91.6 and 110%. The developed method was applied to study antioxidant function of GLS2 in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Changes in concentrations of glutamine, glutamate and glutathione revealed that the overexpression of GLS2 could effectively decrease oxidative stress. In summary, this study developed a rapid HILIC-MS/MS method for quantification of GLS2-related metabolites that could facilitate elucidation of the role of GLS2 in tumor development. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Abnormal expression of γ-Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in living organisms is closely implicated in the development of several human tumors. The GGT levels in tissue and serum have emerged as a potential criterion for tumor diagnosis. However, precise “light up” GGT activity in vivo is still challenging due to the signal interferes of background. Bioluminescence based on the firefly luciferase-catalyzed reaction for light production provides a feasible strategy for GGT detection in vivo. In this report, a bioluminogenic probe, Glu-Luc, was designed and synthesized by connecting D-luciferin with γ-glutamyl group. The cleavage of γ-glutamyl group is triggered by GGT, resulting in the release of D-luciferin, which generates a bright bioluminescence emission in the present of luciferase and ATP. The probe exhibits very high selectivity and sensitivity toward GGT activity from in vitro to in vivo and in clinical samples, which offers a promising tool for investigations of the GGT-overexpressing related biological process including tumor diagnosis and prognosis in living organisms. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Motivation: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has enabled studying structural genomic variants (SVs) such as duplications and inversions in large cohorts. SVs have been shown to play important roles in multiple diseases, including cancer. As costs for NGS continue to decline and variant databases become ever more complete, the relevance of genotyping also SVs from NGS data increases steadily, which is in stark contrast to the lack of tools to do so.Results: We introduce a novel statistical approach, called DIGTYPER (Duplication and Inversion GenoTYPER), which computes genotype likelihoods for a given inversion or duplication and reports the maximum likelihood genotype. In contrast to purely coverage-based approaches, DIGTYPER uses breakpoint-spanning read pairs as well as split alignments for genotyping, enabling typing also of small events. We tested our approach on simulated and on real data and compared the genotype predictions to those made by DELLY, which discovers SVs and computes genotypes, and SVTyper, a genotyping program used to genotype variants detected by LUMPY. DIGTYPER compares favorable especially for duplications (of all lengths) and for shorter inversions (up to 300 bp). In contrast to DELLY, our approach can genotype SVs from data bases without having to rediscover them.Availability and Implementation: https://bitbucket.org/jana_ebler/digtyper.git.Contact: t.marschall@mpi-inf.mpg.de.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. © The Author 2017.

    "Abstract": "Telomerase-specific replication-competent adenoviruses (Ads), i.e., TRADs, which possess an E1 gene expression cassette driven by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter, are promising agents for cancer treatment. However, even though oncolytic Ads, including TRAD, are intratumorally administered, they are disseminated from the tumor to systemic circulation, causing concern about oncolytic Ad-mediated hepatotoxicity (due mainly to leaky expression of Ad genes in liver). We reported that inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) leads to the suppression of replication-incompetent Ad vector-mediated hepatotoxicity via reduction of the leaky expression of Ad genes in liver. Here, to develop a TRAD with an improved safety profile, we designed a TRAD that carries a liver-specific promoter-driven dominant-negative IκBα (DNIκBα) expression cassette (TRAD-DNIκBα). Compared with a conventional TRAD, TRAD-DNIκBα showed hepatocyte-specific inhibition of NF-κB signaling and significantly reduced Ad gene expression and replication in the normal human hepatocyte cell line. TRAD-induced hepatotoxicity was largely suppressed in mice following intravenous administration of TRAD-DNIκBα. However, the replication profiles and oncolytic activities of TRAD-DNIκBα were comparable with those of the conventional TRAD in human non-hepatic tumor cells. These results indicate that oncolytic Ads containing the liver-specific DNIκBα expression cassette have improved safety profiles without inhibiting oncolytic activities. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Recombinant poxviruses, utilized as vaccine vectors and oncolytic viruses, often require manipulation at multiple genetic loci in the viral genome. It is essential for viral vectors to possess no adventitious mutations and no (antibiotic) selection marker in the final product for human patients in order to comply with the guidance from the regulatory agencies. Rintoul et al. have previously developed a selectable and excisable marker (SEM) system for the rapid generation of recombinant vaccinia virus. In the current study, we describe an improved methodology for rapid creation and selection of recombinant poxviruses with multiple genetic manipulations solely based on expression of a fluorescent protein and with no requirement for drug selection that can lead to cellular stress and the risk of adventitious mutations throughout the viral genome. Using this improved procedure combined with the SEM system, we have constructed multiple marker-free oncolytic poxviruses expressing different cytokines and other therapeutic genes. The high fidelity of inserted DNA sequences validates the utility of this improved procedure for generation of therapeutic viruses for human patients. We have created an oncolytic poxvirus expressing human chemokine CCL5, designated as vvDD-A34R-hCCL5, with manipulations at two genetic loci in a single virus. Finally, we have produced and purified this virus in clinical grade for its use in a phase I clinical trial and presented data on initial in vitro characterization of the virus. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Oncolytic viruses are currently established as a novel type of immunotherapy. The challenge is to safely target oncolytic viruses to tumors. Previously, we have generated influenza A viruses (IAVs) containing deletions in the viral interferon antagonist. Those deletions have attenuated the virus in normal tissue but allowed replication in tumor cells. IAV entry is mediated by hemagglutinin (HA), which needs to be activated by a serine protease, for example, through trypsin. To further target the IAV to tumors, we have changed the trypsin cleavage site to an elastase cleavage site. We chose this cleavage site because elastase is expressed in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the exchange of the cleavage site previously has been shown to attenuate viral growth in lungs. Newly generated elastase-activated influenza viruses (AE viruses) grew to similar titers in tumor cells as the trypsin-activated counterparts (AT viruses). Intratumoral injection of AE viruses into syngeneic B16f1 melanoma-derived tumors in mice reduced tumor growth similar to AT viruses and had a better therapeutic effect in heterologous human PANC-1-derived tumors. Therefore, the introduction of the attenuation marker “elastase cleavage site” in viral HA allows for safe, effective oncolytic virus therapy. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Napoleona vogelii is used in traditional medicine for cancer management. AIM: The study was conducted to evaluate the antigenotoxic and antioxidant activities of methanol stem bark extract of N. vogelii in male Sprague Dawley rats. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Thirty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into group 1 (control) administered 10 mL/kg distilled water, groups 2 and 3 were co-administered 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg of N. vogelli and 5 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CPA) respectively for 7 days p.o. Groups 4 and 5 were administered only 5 mg/kg CPA and 200 mg/kg NV respectively. RESULTS: The LD50 oral was greater than 4 g/kg. There were significant (p < 0.0001) increases in plasma enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant enzymes and significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in percentage micronuclei in bone marrow of extract treated rats compared to rats administered 5 mg/kg CPA alone. There was steatosis pointing to cytotoxic injury in the liver of rats co-administered 200 mg/kg NV and 5 mg/kg CPA. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the extract showed the presence of phytol and unsaturated fatty acids. CONCLUSION: N. vogelii possesses antigenotoxic and antioxidant activities associated with the presence of phytochemicals, phytol and unsaturated fatty acids. © 2017 Victor Ikumawoyi, Esther Agbaje, Olufunsho Awodele.",

    "Abstract": "Imprinted genes occur in discrete clusters that are coordinately regulated by shared DNA elements called Imprinting Control Regions. H19 and Igf2 are linked imprinted genes that play critical roles in development. Loss of imprinting (LOI) at the IGF2/H19 locus on the maternal chromosome is associated with the developmental disorder Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and with several cancers. Here we use comprehensive genetic and genomic analyses to follow muscle development in a mouse model of BWS to dissect the separate and shared roles for misexpression of Igf2 and H19 in the disease phenotype. We show that LOI results in defects in muscle differentiation and hypertrophy and identify primary downstream targets: Igf2 overexpression results in over-activation of MAPK signaling while loss of H19 lncRNA prevents normal down regulation of p53 activity and therefore results in reduced AKT/mTOR signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate instances where H19 and Igf2 misexpression work separately, cooperatively, and antagonistically to establish the developmental phenotype. This study thus identifies new biochemical roles for the H19 lncRNA and underscores that LOI phenotypes are multigenic so that complex interactions will contribute to disease outcomes. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the alterations in the neoplastic tissue of GIST following Imatinib treatment. Material/Methods: CT studies of 14 patients with inoperable primary tumors and 56 patients with metastatic and recurrent disease after chemotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. The following alterations in features of primary and secondary tumors were analyzed: dimension, degree and type of contrast enhancement, outlines of lesions, presence of intratumoral bleeding, presence of calcifications. Results: In the analyzed group of primary, metastatic and recurrent tumors after treatment with Imatinib in most cases a decrease in size and contrast enhancement were observed; the outlines of lesions became well circumscribed. Following the treatment, the number of tumors enhancing inhomogeneously decreased. In primary tumors the percentage of calcifications increased, whereas in metastatic tumors calcifications were observed only after treatment. There was no bleeding found within primary tumors after treatment. In metastatic disease, increased percentage of tumors with transient intratumoral bleeding was observed. There were also some unconventional CT images following treatment, such as: cystic transformation of lesions, enlargement of lesions, appearing of new lesions suggesting progression of the disease, stationary dimensions of lesions during local progression of the disease, simultaneous decrease and increase in size of metastatic lesions or appearance of new ones. Conclusions: Right from the start of Imatinib therapy in inoperable and disseminated GIST patients, specific CT images, not seen during conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, were observed. © Pol J Radiol, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Arboreal pit vipers of the Trimeresurus complex group are medically important species in Indonesia (west of Wallace's line), but there is no specific antivenom produced in the country for treating related envenomation. Instead, the exiting trivalent Indonesian antivenom, Biosave ® Serum Anti Bisa Ular (SABU, indicated for envenoming by Malayan pit viper, Javan spitting cobra and banded krait) is often misused to treat Trimeresus envenoming resulting in poor therapeutic outcome. Here, we investigated the cross-reactivity and neutralization capability of Thai Green Pit Viper Antivenom (GPVAV) against the venoms of four Indonesian Trimeresurus species. Consistently, the venoms of Trimeresurus (Trimeresurus) insularis, Trimeresurus (Trimeresurus) purpureomaculatus, Trimeresurus (Parias) hageni and Trimeresurus (Craspedocephalus) puniceus of Indonesia showed stronger immunoreactivity on ELISA to GPVAV than to Biosave ® . The findings correlated with in vivo neutralization results, whereby GPVAV was far more effective than Biosave ® in cross-neutralizing the lethality of the venoms by a potency of at least 13 to 80 times higher. The efficacy of GPVAV is partly attributable to its cross-neutralization of the procoagulant effect of the venoms, thereby mitigating the progression of venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy. The paraspecific effectiveness of GPVAV against Trimeresurus species envenoming in Indonesia await further clinical investigation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The antitumor and actin-depolymerizing marine macrolide aplyronine A (ApA) synergistically binds to tubulin in association with actin, and prevents spindle formation and mitosis. While the crystal structure of the actin ApA complex was solved in 2006, its interaction with the tubulin heterodimer has not been clarified. To investigate the binding modes of ApA as a unique protein–protein interaction (PPI)-inducer between these two cytoskeletal proteins, we prepared its photoaffinity acetylene and fluorescent derivatives with the aid of molecular modeling studies for probe design. Among these three derivatives, the ApA–PPA–TAMRA probe specifically photoreacted with both actin and tubulin in vitro. However, the photolabeling yield of tubulin was quite low (up to ∼1%), and one of the major side-reactions was the addition of a water molecule to the carbene species generated from an aryldiazirine moiety on the hydrophilic surface of actin. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Current literature may overestimate the risk of nodal metastasis from thin melanoma due to reporting of data only from lesions treated with SLNB. Our objective was to define the natural history of thin melanoma, assessing the likelihood of nodal disease, in order to guide selection for SLNB. Methods: Retrospective review. The primary outcome was the rate of nodal disease. Clinicopathologic factors were evaluated to find associations with nodal disease. Results: Five hundred and twelve lesions, follow up available for 488 (median: 48 months). Lesions treated with WLE/SLNB compared to WLE alone were more likely to have high-risk features. The rate of nodal disease was higher in the WLE/SLNB group (24 positive SLNB, five false-negative SLNB with nodal recurrence: 10.2%) compared to WLE alone (four nodal recurrences: 2.0%). Univariate analysis showed age ≤45, Breslow depth ≥0.85 mm, mitotic rate &gt;1 mm 2 , and ulceration were associated with nodal disease. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of age ≤45 and ulceration. Conclusions: SLNB for melanoma 0.75-0.99 mm should be considered in patients age ≤45, Breslow depth ≥0.85 mm, mitotic rate &gt;1 mm 2 , and/or with ulceration. Thin melanoma &lt;0.85 mm without high-risk features may be treated with WLE alone. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective We present such a case of aggressive osteoblastoma of cervical spine. We describe its complicated clinical progression, hoping to shed light on the surgical strategy of this complex tumor. Methods We present such a case of aggressive osteoblastoma involving the C6–7 vertebrae. A 25-year-old man was diagnosed as aggressive osteoblastoma of the cervical spine. The lesion encroached upon the radicular foramina and was located adjacent to the canal of the vertebral artery. Preoperative embolization was performed to reduce intraoperative bleeding and to prevent intraoperative injury of the vertebral artery. Results A pathologic examination showed osteoblasts suggestive of osteoblastoma. At 2-year follow-up, bony union was achieved, and there was no evidence of recurrence on a CT scan. Conclusion En bloc total resection for highly vascular osteoblastoma is ideal, but this case shows that piecemeal total resection following preoperative embolization is a surgical option for highly expansive osteoblastoma. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",

    "Abstract": "Oncolytic Semliki Forest virus (SFV) has been suggested as a potential candidate for the treatment of glioblastoma and neuroblastoma. However, the oncolytic capacity of SFV is restricted by the anti-viral type-I interferon (IFN) response. The aim of this study was to increase the oncolytic capacity of a microRNA target tagged SFV against glioblastoma by arming it with the Vaccinia-virus-encoded type-I IFN decoy receptor B18R (SFV4B18RmiRT) to neutralize type-I IFN response. Expression of B18R by SFV4B18RmiRT aided neutralization of IFN-β which was shown by reduced STAT-1 phosphorylation and improved virus spread in plaque assays. B18R expression by SFV4 increased its oncolytic capacity in vitro against murine glioblastoma (CT-2A), regardless of the presence of exogenous IFN-β. Both SFV4B18RmiRT and SFV4miRT treatments controlled tumor growth in mice with syngeneic orthotopic gliomablastoma (CT-2A). However, treatment with SFV4B18RmiRT induced severe neurological symptoms in some mice because of virus replication in the healthy brain. Neither neurotoxicity nor virus replication in the brain was observed when SFV4miRT was administered. In summary, our results indicate that the oncolytic capacity of SFV4 was improved in vitro and in vivo by incorporation of B18R, but neurotoxicity of the virus was increased, possibly due to loss of microRNA targets. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Spermine oxidase (SMOX) is a flavin-containing enzyme that oxidizes spermine to produce spermidine, 3-aminopropanaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide. SMOX has been shown to play key roles in inflammation and carcinogenesis; indeed, it is differentially expressed in several human cancer types. Our previous investigation has revealed that SMOX purified after heterologous expression in Escherichia coli actually consists of monomers, covalent homodimers, and other higher-order forms. All association forms oxidize spermine and, after treatment with dithiothreitol, revert to SMOX monomer. Here, we report a detailed investigation on the thermal denaturation of SMOX and its association forms in native and reducing conditions. By combining spectroscopic methods (circular dichroism, fluorescence) and thermal methods (differential scanning calorimetry), we provide new insights into the structure, the transformation, and the stability of SMOX. While the crystal structure of this protein is not available yet, experimental results are interpreted also on the basis of a novel SMOX structural model, obtained in silico exploiting the recently solved acetylspermine oxidase crystal structure. We conclude that while at least one specific intermolecular disulfide bond links two SMOX molecules to form the homodimer, the thermal denaturation profiles can be justified by the presence of at least one intramolecular disulfide bond, which also plays a critical role in the stabilization of the overall three-dimensional SMOX structure, and in particular of its flavin adenine dinucleotide- containing active site. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive primary brain tumors, is characterized by highly immunosuppressive microenvironment. This contributes to glioblastoma resistance to standard treatment modalities and allows tumor growth and recurrence. Several immune-targeted approaches have been recently developed and are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation. Oncolytic viruses, including the autonomous protoparvovirus H-1 (H-1PV), show great promise as novel immunotherapeutic tools. In a first phase I/IIa clinical trial (ParvOryx01), H-1PV was safe and well tolerated when locally or systemically administered to recurrent glioblastoma patients. The virus was able to cross the blood-brain (tumor) barrier after intravenous infusion. Importantly, H-1PV treatment of glioblastoma patients was associated with immunogenic changes in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor infiltration with activated cytotoxic T cells, induction of cathepsin B and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) expression in tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAM), and accumulation of activated TAM in cluster of differentiation (CD) 40 ligand (CD40L)-positive glioblastoma regions was detected. These are the first-in-human observations of H-1PV capacity to switch the immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment towards immunogenicity. Based on this pilot study, we present a tentative model of H-1PV-mediated modulation of glioblastoma microenvironment and propose a combinatorial therapeutic approach taking advantage of H-1PV-induced microglia/macrophage activation for further (pre)clinical testing. © 2017 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "Planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins are implicated in a variety of morphogenetic processes including embryonic cell migration and potentially cancer progression. During zebrafish gastrulation, the transmembrane protein Vang-like 2 (VANGL2) is required for PCP and directed cell migration. These cell behaviors occur in the context of a fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM). While it is thought that interactions with the ECM regulate cell migration, it is unclear how PCP proteins such as VANGL2 influence these events. Using an in vitro cell culture model system, we previously showed that human VANGL2 negatively regulates membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP14) and activation of secreted matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Here, we investigated the functional relationship between VANGL2, integrin αvβ3, and MMP2 activation. We provide evidence that VANGL2 regulates cell surface integrin αvβ3 expression and adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin. Inhibition of MMP14/MMP2 activity suppressed the cell adhesion defect in VANGL2 knockdown cells. Furthermore, our data show that MMP14 and integrin αv are required for increased proteolysis by VANGL2 knockdown cells. Lastly, we have identified integrin αvβ3 as a novel VANGL2 binding partner. Together, these findings begin to dissect the molecular underpinnings of how VANGL2 regulates MMP activity and cell adhesion to the ECM. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in many biological processes, and its level in plasma and other biological fluids is closely related to many diseases. In this work, a selective room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) detection method for miRNA was developed based on a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) -assisted signal amplification strategy and phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) between poly-diallyldimethylammonium chloride-modified quantum dots (QDs@PDDA) and 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine-modified miRNA sequences complementary oligonucleotide (ROX-ssDNA). The positively charged QDs@PDDA could adsorb negatively charged ROX-ssDNA by electrostatic interaction, whereas the RTP signal of QDs@PDDA could be efficiently quenched by ROX-ssDNA via PRET. In the presence of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and DSN, miR-21 hybridized with ROX-ssDNA initially to form a DNA-RNA heteroduplex as the substrate of DSN, then ssDNA in DNA-RNA heteroduplex would be cleaved into small fragments by DSN and liberate miR-21 to hybridize with another ROX-ssDNA. Eventually, due to weak interaction between ROX-ssDNA fragments and QDs@PDDA, PRET efficiency continually decreased whereas the RTP signal was significantly amplified. By employing the strategy above, quantitative detection of miR-21 in the range of 0.25–40 nM with a detection limit of 0.16 nM was realized, showing excellent performance with simplicity, good selectivity and the ability to be a promising method for miRNA detection. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The PTPN11 oncogene encodes the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, which, through its role in multiple signaling pathways, promotes the progression of hematological malignancies and other cancers. Here, we employ high-throughput screening to discover a lead chemical scaffold, the benzothiazolopyrimidones, that allosterically inhibits this oncogenic phosphatase by simultaneously engaging the C-SH2 and PTP domains. We improved our lead to generate an analogue that better suppresses SHP2 activity in vitro. Suppression of Erk phopsphorylation by the lead compound is also consistent with SHP2 inhibition in AML cells. Our findings provide an alternative starting point for therapeutic intervention and will catalyze investigations into the relationship between SHP2 conformational regulation, activity, and disease progression. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Polymer vesicles are self-assembled shells of amphiphilic block copolymers (BCPs) that have attracted tremendous interest due to their encapsulation ability and intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents. However, typical processes for the formation of polymer vesicles lead to ensembles of structures with a broad size distribution (from nanometer to micrometer scale) which result in a limitation for efficient cellular uptake. In this study, we present a simple and efficient approach for the fabrication of polymer vesicles with uniform nanoscale dimensions from template formation of electrosprayed particles in a high throughput manner. First, electrospraying was applied to produce micrometer-sized templates of a block copolymer before polymer vesicles were formed from the pre-prepared microparticles via rehydration. Four different biocompatible diblock and triblock copolymers were used to successfully fabricate polymer vesicles with uniform size around 150 nm using this approach. Furthermore, we encapsulate anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) within the polymer vesicles via this method. The kinetics of cellular uptake (HeLa cell) and intracellular distribution of DOX-loaded polymer vesicles have been quntified and monitored by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. The results show that our new method provides a promising way to fabricate drug-loaded polymer vesicles with controllable nanoscale size for intracellular anticancer drug delivery. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) is recommended for melanoma patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB); however, 50% do not undergo CLND. We sought to determine CLND trends over time, and factors contributing to variability. Methods: The NCDB was queried for patients undergoing wide local excision (WLE), with or without SLNB and CLND. Cohorts were created based on demographic/socioeconomic variables and era of treatment (Era 1: 2003-07, Era 2: 2008-12). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with performance of or trends in CLND. Results: 122 849 underwent WLE with SLNB. Of 24 267 (19.8%) with +SLNB, 13 594 (56.0%) continued to CLND. In multivariate analyses, Medicaid (OR 0.78; P = 0.04) or Medicare (OR 0.79; P < 0.01) in Era 1 and patients without insurance in Era 2 (OR 0.78; P = 0.01) underwent less CLND. In both eras, Blacks (OR 0.45; P < 0.01, OR 0.59; P < 0.01), head/neck lesions (OR 0.72; P < 0.01, OR 0.66; P < 0.01) and lower extremity lesions (OR 0.75; P < 0.01, OR 0.72; P < 0.01) underwent less CLND. However, Blacks experienced greatest increase in CLND usage (+9.2%). Conclusions: CLND usage continues to be low and racial/socioeconomic disparities persist. Until the results of MSLT-2 become available, continued focus on understanding poor adherence to, and improving rates of CLND is necessary. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The clinical efficacy displayed by ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been challenged by the frequent emergence of resistant clones. The ibrutinib target, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is essential for B-cell receptor signaling, and most resistant cases carry mutations in BTK or PLCG2, a downstream effector target of BTK. Recent findings show that MI-2, a small molecule inhibitor of the para-caspase MALT1, is effective in preclinical models of another type of BCR pathway- dependent lymphoma. We therefore studied the activity of MI- 2 against CLL and ibrutinib-resistant CLL. Treatment of CLL cells in vitro with MI-2 inhibited MALT1 proteolytic activity reduced BCR and NF-kB signaling, inhibited nuclear translocation of RelB and p50, and decreased Bcl-xL levels. MI-2 selectively induced dose and time-dependent apoptosis in CLL cells, sparing normal B lymphocytes. Furthermore, MI-2 abrogated survival signals provided by stromal cells and BCR crosslinking and was effective against CLL cells harboring features associated with poor outcomes, including 17p deletion and unmutated IGHV. Notably, MI-2 was effective against CLL cells collected from patients harboring mutations conferring resistance to ibrutinib. Overall, our findings provide a preclinical rationale for the clinical development of MALT1 inhibitors in CLL, in particular for ibrutinib-resistant forms of this disease. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: High throughput sequencing requires bioinformatics pipelines to process large volumes of data into meaningful variants that can be translated into a clinical report. These pipelines often suffer from a number of shortcomings: they lack robustness and have many components written in multiple languages, each with a variety of resource requirements. Pipeline components must be linked together with a workflow system to achieve the processing of FASTQ files through to a VCF file of variants. Crafting these pipelines requires considerable bioinformatics and IT skills beyond the reach of many clinical laboratories. Results: Here we present Canary, a single program that can be run on a laptop, which takes FASTQ files from amplicon assays through to an annotated VCF file ready for clinical analysis. Canary can be installed and run with a single command using Docker containerization or run as a single JAR file on a wide range of platforms. Although it is a single utility, Canary performs all the functions present in more complex and unwieldy pipelines. All variants identified by Canary are 3' shifted and represented in their most parsimonious form to provide a consistent nomenclature, irrespective of sequencing variation. Further, proximate in-phase variants are represented as a single HGVS 'delins' variant. This allows for correct nomenclature and consequences to be ascribed to complex multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), which are otherwise difficult to represent and interpret. Variants can also be annotated with hundreds of attributes sourced from MyVariant.info to give up to date details on pathogenicity, population statistics and in-silico predictors. Conclusions: Canary has been used at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne for the last 2 years for the processing of clinical sequencing data. By encapsulating clinical features in a single, easily installed executable, Canary makes sequencing more accessible to all pathology laboratories. Canary is available for download as source or a Docker image at https://github.com/PapenfussLab/Canaryunder a GPL-3.0 License. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose We assessed the effectiveness of shingles vaccine in preventing incident shingles among Alberta residents aged 50 years or older over the period 2009 – 2015, using administrative health data. Methods The cohort comprised of Albertans from the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan Registry (AHCIP) as of June 30, 2009 and aged 50 years or older. Those who received shingles vaccine were identified from the provincial pharmaceutical information network. The occurrence of incident shingles was identified through both inpatient and outpatients/community care data. Incident shingles was defined as the earliest dated record of ICD 9-CM 053 or ICD-10-CA B02. Starting on November 1, 2009, individuals with no history of shingles or shingles vaccination were followed until Nov 1, 2015 (6 years), or until shingles incidence, death, or AHCIP cancellation (including leaving Alberta). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as the inverse of the relative risk of developing incident shingles in each year following vaccination compared to time at risk without vaccination, while adjusting for age, sex, income quintile, and immune compromising conditions (identified from physician claims, inpatient, and cancer registry data). Results There were 1,094,236 individuals in the cohort, with 85,439 (7.80%) vaccinated individuals. The shingles incidence rate was 9.03 [95% CI: 8.95, 9.11] cases per 1,000 person years (49,243 cases). Adjusted VE in the first year following immunization was 50.02% [95% CI: 44.71%, 54.83%] against incident shingles, decreasing to no effect by the fifth year (VE = 14.00% [95% CI: −20.99%, 38.88%]). Conclusions Our findings are consistent with observations from other population based studies and provide population level data for policy-makers to review when making decisions related to public funding of shingles vaccine. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "The reactions of N4P4Cl8 (1), with two equimolar amounts of N-(1-ferrocenylmethyl)-N-methyl-propylenediamine gave the monoferrocenyl-spiro (as a byproduct), bisferrocenyl-2-trans-6-dispiro (2) and bisferrocenyl-2-cis-6-dispiro (3) cyclotetraphosphazenes. The 2-trans-6-dispiro (2) was reacted with excess monoamines to produce the tetraamino products (2a-2d). The one equimolar amount of the diamines and dialkoxides with 2 afforded the mono-diamino (2e and 2f) and mono-dialkoxy (2g and 2h) cyclotetraphosphazenes. Whereas, excess diamines and dialkoxides with 2 produced the bis-diamino (2i and 2j) and bis-dialkoxy (2k and 2l) bisferrocenyl-2-trans-6-dispirocyclotetraphosphazenes. The structures of the compounds were verified by elemental analyses, ESI-MS, FTIR, HSQC, HMBC, 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR techniques. The molecular structures of 2 and 2b were established by X-ray crystallography. Compounds 2e and 2f have two stereogenic P-atoms. Additionally, the structures of 2i-2l containing tetraspiro rings in the skeletons look similar a propeller. The Fc groups of the cyclotetraphosphazenes were found to be redox active with two-reversible electron oxidations. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was examined against some bacteria and yeast strains. The interactions of the compounds with DNA revealed that the compounds caused conformational changes even strand break on supercoiled DNA helix. Furthermore, the compounds (except 2, 2a and 2d) inhibited DNA restriction indicating compounds binding to A/A and G/G nucleotides of the DNA. The evaluations of the cytotoxic activity against L929 fibroblast and DLD-1 colon cancer cell lines were carried out. Some of the compounds were evaluated for antituberculosis activity against reference strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and 2i and 2l displayed antituberculosis activity against H37Rv. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Several challenges remained to fabricate a molecular-level nucleic acid biosensor such as surface immobilization control, single mismatch detection and low current response. To overcome those issues, for the first time, authors presented a novel parallel structural dsDNA/recombinant azurin (PSD/rAzu) hybrid structure for the general nucleic acid detection. The PSD was designed and introduced by the optimized 8 Ag+ ions to have greater conductivity than the canonical dsDNA, and conjugated with rAzu to develop a general platform for electrochemical detection of miRNAs and viral DNAs with high reproducibility and ultra-sensitivity towards single base pair mutation. Thanks to the bifunctional rAzu as the selective spacer and electrochemical signal mediator, in the presence of the target strand, the imperfect PSD switched rapidly to the upright position where the Ag+ ions intercalated between C-C mismatches of dsDNAs at the top of each structure brought further from the electrode surface resulting in a significant electrochemical signal drop of the Ag+ ions. The charge transfer (CT) mechanism across the hybrid structure was simply clarified on the basis of the redox potential location of the species. The electrical conductivity of DNAs were measured using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) at the molecular scale and cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique based on the reduction of Ag+ ion. The proposed PSD/rAzu hybrid structure with a great capability of single mutation recognition and miRNA expression level profiling in cancer cells holds a very promising platform to be studied for further development of various kinds of nanoscale biosensors, bioelectronic devices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Despite advances in conventional chemotherapy, surgical techniques, and radiation, outcomes for patients with relapsed, refractory, or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas are dismal. Survivors often suffer from lasting morbidity from current treatments. New targeted therapies with less toxicity, such as those that harness the immune system, and immunocompetent murine sarcoma models to test these therapies are greatly needed. We characterized two new serendipitous murine models of undifferentiated sarcoma (SARC-28 and SARC-45) and tested their sensitivity to virotherapy with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Both models expressed high levels of the primary HSV entry molecule nectin-1 (CD111) and were susceptible to killing by interleukin-12 (IL-12) producing HSV-1 M002 in vitro and in vivo. M002 resulted in a significant intratumoral increase in effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and activated monocytes, and a decrease in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in immunocompetent mice. Compared to parent virus R3659 (no IL-12 production), M002 resulted in higher CD8:MDSC and CD8:T regulatory cell (Treg) ratios, suggesting that M002 creates a more favorable immune tumor microenvironment. These data provide support for clinical trials targeting sarcomas with oncolytic HSV-1. These models provide an exciting opportunity to explore combination therapies for soft tissue sarcomas that rely on an intact immune system to reach full therapeutic potential. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Background Minimally invasive surgery has achieved worldwide acceptance in various fields, however, pancreatic surgery remains one of the most challenging abdominal procedures. In fact, the indication for robotic surgery in pancreatic disease has been controversial. The present study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of robotic pancreatic resection. Methods We retrospectively reviewed our experience of robotic pancreatic resection done in Sanchinarro University Hospital. Clinicopathologic characteristics, and perioperative and postoperative outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Results From October 2010 to April 2016, 50 patients underwent robotic-assisted surgery for different pancreatic pathologies. All procedures were performed using the da Vinci robotic system. Of the 50 patients, 26 were male and 24 female. The average age of all patients was 62 years. Operative time was 370 minutes. Among the procedures performed were 16 pancreaticoduodenectomies (PD), 23 distal pan-createctomies (DP), 11 tumor enucleations (TE). The mean hospital stay was 17.6 days in PD group, 9.0 days in DP group and 8.4 days in TE group. Pancreatic fistula occurred in 10 cases (20%), 2 after PD, 3 after DP, and 5 after TE. Four patients had postoperative transfusion in PD group and one in DP group. Conversion to open laparotomy occurred in four patients (8%). No serious intraoperative complications were observed. Conclusions From our early experience, robotic pancreatic surgery is a safe and feasible procedure.

    "Abstract": "On October 23, 2015, the FDA approved trabectedin, a new molecular entity for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma who received a prior anthracycline-containing regimen. Approval was based on results of a single, randomized, active-controlled, 518-patient, multicenter study comparing the safety and efficacy of trabectedin 1.5 mg/ m2 as a 24-hour continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion once every 3 weeks with dacarbazine 1, 000 mg/m2 i.v. once every 3 weeks. Treatment with trabectedin resulted in a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), with a PFS of 4.2 months and 1.5 months for trabectedin and dacarbazine, respectively (HR, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.70; unstratified log-rank test, P &lt; 0.001). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, peripheral edema, dyspnea, and headache. Serious adverse reactions included anaphylaxis, neutropenic sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and extravasation resulting in tissue necrosis. A postmarketing trial was required to evaluate the serious risk of cardiomyopathy. This approval provides another treatment option in a setting where no drug has been shown to improve overall survival. A key regulatory consideration during review of this application was the use of PFS as an endpoint to support regular approval of trabectedin. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lactose provides an easily-digested energy source for neonates, and is the primary carbohydrate in milk in most species. Bovine lactose is also a key component of many human food products. However, compared to analyses of other milk components, the genetic control of lactose has been little studied. Here we present the first GWAS focussed on analysis of milk lactose traits. Results: Using a discovery population of 12,000 taurine dairy cattle, we detail 27 QTL for lactose concentration and yield, and subsequently validate the effects of 26 of these loci in a distinct population of 18,000 cows. We next present data implicating causative genes and variants for these QTL. Fine mapping of these regions using imputed, whole genome sequence-resolution genotypes reveals protein-coding candidate causative variants affecting the ABCG2, DGAT1, STAT5B, KCNH4, NPFFR2 and RNF214 genes. Eleven of the remaining QTL appear to be driven by regulatory effects, suggested by the presence of co-locating, co-segregating eQTL discovered using mammary RNA sequence data from a population of 357 lactating cows. Pathway analysis of genes representing all lactose-associated loci shows significant enrichment of genes located in the endoplasmic reticulum, with functions related to ion channel activity mediated through the LRRC8C, P2RX4, KCNJ2 and ANKH genes. A number of the validated QTL are also found to be associated with additional milk volume, fat and protein phenotypes. Conclusions: Overall, these findings highlight novel candidate genes and variants involved in milk lactose regulation, whose impacts on membrane transport mechanisms reinforce the key osmo-regulatory roles of lactose in milk. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), one of three proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes, has multifunctional roles in cellular context. Here, we report a novel molecular mechanism and function of USP14 in regulating autophagy induction and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation induced by toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (TLR4). USP14 interacted with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interrupted the association of Beclin 1 with TRAF6, leading to inhibition of TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of Beclin 1. Reduced expression of USP14 in USP14-knockdown (USP14 KD ) THP-1 cells enhanced autophagy induction upon TLR4 stimulation as shown by the increased conversion of cytosolic LC3-I to membrane-bound LC3-II. Moreover, USP14 KD human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells and USP14 KD human hepatic adenocarcinoma SK-HEP-1 cells showed increased cell migration and invasion, indicating that USP14 is negatively implicated in the cancer progression by the inhibition of autophagy induction. Furthermore, we found that USP14 interacted with TAK1-binding protein (TAB) 2 protein and induced deubiquitination of TAB 2, a key factor in the activation of NF-κB. Functionally, overexpression of USP14 suppressed TLR4-induced activation of NF-κB. In contrast, USP14 KD THP-1 cells showed enhanced activation of NF-κB, NF-κB-dependent gene expression, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Taken together, our data demonstrate that USP14 can negatively regulate autophagy induction by inhibiting Beclin 1 ubiquitination, interrupting association between TRAF6 and Beclin 1, and affecting TLR4-induced activation of NF-κB through deubiquitination of TAB 2 protein. © 2017 Min, Lee, Kim, Chun and Lee.",

    "Abstract": "Bacterial and plant A/B toxins exploit the natural trafficking pathways in eukaryotic cells to reach their intracellular target(s) in the cytosol and to ultimately kill. Such A/B toxins generally consist of an enzymatically active Asubunit (e.g., ricin toxin A (RTA)) and one or more cell binding Bsubunit(s), which are responsible for toxin binding to specific cell surface receptors. Our current knowledge of how A/B toxins are capable of efficiently intoxicating cells helped scientists to understand fundamental cellular mechanisms, like endocytosis and intracellular protein sorting in higher eukaryotic cells. From a medical point of view, it is likewise important to identify the major toxin trafficking routes to find adequate treatment solutions for patients or to eventually develop therapeutic toxin-based applications for cancer therapy. Since genome-wide analyses of A/B toxin trafficking in mammalian cells is complex, time-consuming, and expensive, several studies on A/B toxin transport have been performed in the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite being less complex, fundamental cellular processes in yeast and higher eukaryotic cells are similar and very often results obtained in yeast can be transferred to the mammalian situation. Here, we describe a fast and easy to use reporter assay to analyze the intracellular trafficking of RTA in yeast. An essential advantage of the new assay is the opportunity to investigate not only RTA retro-translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol, but rather endocytosis and retrograde toxin transport from the plasma membrane into the ER. The assay makes use of a reporter plasmid that allows indirect measurement of RTA toxicity through fluorescence emission of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) after in vivo translation. Since RTA efficiently prevents the initiation of protein biosynthesis by 28S rRNA depurination, this assay allows the identification of host cell proteins involved in intracellular RTA transport through the detection of changes in fluorescence emission. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) displays a highly aggressive malignancy and is considered to be an incurable and rapidly lethal disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of approximately nucleotides that regulate several aspects of tumors pathogenesis, including migration, invasion, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We have found that miR-107 was significantly high expression in PDAC tissues and cells. High miR-107 expression is associated with poor clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in PDAC patients. Deregulated expression of miR-107 in PDAC cells (AsPC-1 and Panc-1) is sufficient to reduce cell migration and invasion, and to induce upregulation of epithelial markers (β-catenin, ZO-1 and E-cadherin) and a decrease of mesenchymal marker expression (ZEB-1 and vimentin). We also found that the caveolin-1, PTEN and p-Akt expression are modulated by miR-107 in PDAC cells. Moreover, our study clearly demonstrated that deregulated expression of miR-107 inhibited cell migration and invasion and EMT by up-regulation of caveolin-1 and PTEN, and inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling in PDAC cells. Our study suggested that miR‑107 expression might both be a useful indicator of the metastatic potential and provided a new potential therapeutic target in PDAC. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The transcriptional regulator FUSE Binding Protein 1 (FUBP1) is overexpressed in more than 80% of all human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and other solid tumor entities including prostate and colorectal carcinoma. FUBP1 expression is required for HCC tumor cell expansion, and it functions as an important pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic oncoprotein that binds to the single-stranded DNA sequence FUSE to regulate the transcription of a variety of target genes. In this study, we screened an FDA-approved drug library and discovered that the Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) and its derivative 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), the active irinotecan metabolite that is used in the clinics in combination with other chemotherapeutics to treat carcinoma, inhibit FUBP1 activity. Both molecules prevent in vitro the binding of FUBP1 to its single-stranded target DNA FUSE, and they induce deregulation of FUBP1 target genes in HCC cells. Our results suggest the interference with the FUBP1/FUSE interaction as a further molecular mechanism that, in addition to the inactivation of TOP1, may contribute to the therapeutic potential of CPT/SN-38. Targeting of FUBP1 in HCC therapy with SN-38/irinotecan could be a particularly interesting option because of the high FUBP1 levels in HCC cells and their dependency on FUBP1 expression. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aims The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization-domain containing 2 (NOD2) are important in cancer and in microbial recognition, respectively. These molecules trigger intracellular signaling pathways inducing the expression of inflammatory genes by NF-kB translocation. Gefitinib (GBTC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) are capable of inhibiting EGFR/NOD2 and NF-kB, respectively. In earlier stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection, monocytes are capable of sustaining viral replication and increasing cytokine production, suggesting that monocyte/macrophages play an important role in early DENV replication. GBTC and PDTC have not been used to modify the pathogenesis of DENV in infected cells. This study was aimed to determine the effect of GBTC and PDTC on viral replication and cytokine production in DENV serotype 2 (DENV2)–infected human monocyte cultures. Main methods GBTC and PDTC were used to inhibit EGFR/NOD2 and NF-kB, respectively. Cytokine production was measured by ELISA and viral replication by plaque forming unit assay. Key findings Increased DENV2 replication and anti-viral cytokine production (IFN-α/β, TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-18) in infected cultures were found. These parameters were decreased after EGFR/NOD2 or NF-kB inhibitions. Significance The inhibitory effects of GBTC and PDTC on viral replication and cytokine production can be beneficial in the treatment of patients infected by dengue and suggest a possible role of EGFR/NOD2 receptors and NF-kB in dengue pathogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aims Exercise is beneficial in obesity, however, the debate about the value of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) vs. moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) has been long lasting. Therefore, here we have compared the possible beneficial effects of two different exercise training regimes in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Materials and methods Following 7 wk. on high fat diet (HFD), ten-week-old male ICR mice (n = 30) were assigned to HIIT, distance-matched MICT or remained sedentary for the next 8 constitutive weeks while maintaining the dietary treatments. Age-matched sedentary mice with standard diet were used as a control (n = 10). Exercise was performed on a motorized treadmill for 5 days a week. Key findings Both modes of exercise ameliorated adiposity and related metabolic dysfunction induced by HFD and sedentary lifestyle, while mice following HIIT exhibited significantly lower body weight, percentage of fat mass and smaller adipocyte size. HIIT was more favorable in preventing liver lipid accumulation by restoring mRNA levels of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis (SREBP1, ACC1, FAS) and β-oxidation (PPARα, CPT1a, HAD). In addition, HIIT was more efficient in mitigating adipose tissue inflammation and insulin insensitivity, partly dependent on abrogating phosphorylation of JNK/IRS1 (Ser307) pathway. Moreover, only HIIT led to pronounced beige adipocyte recruitment in inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Significance We conclude that HIIT contribute a more favorable regulation of metabolic dysfunctions in DIO mice compared with MICT. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "pH-sensitive nanogels with ortho ester linkages were conveniently prepared through reaction of thiol-ene click chemistry. Through adjusting feed reactant ratios and concentrations of ortho ester diacrylamide (OEAM), pentaerythritol tetra(3-mercaptopropionate) (PT), and methoxyl poly(ethyleneglycol) acrylate (mPEGA), the size of the nanogels could be controlled at 100–200 nm with relatively narrow size distributions. The nanogels with size of 149.1 ± 17.7 nm (designed as NG) were verified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic laser scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded into NG with high drug loading efficiency up to 73.7%. In vitro drug release studies showed that up to 75.9% DOX from NG was released in 24 h at pH 5.0 because of hydrolysis of ortho ester. Cellular uptake studies confirmed that DOX-loaded NG (NG/DOX) could be readily internalized by two-dimensional cells, resulting in efficient antitumor efficiency of cancer cells. Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) as in vitro tumor model was used to further evaluate the antitumor effect of NG/DOX. The results demonstrated that NG/DOX showed a significantly enhanced penetration and growth inhibition in 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS), compared to free DOX. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has been shown to be associated with the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases and NT-proBNP level is elevated in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, the association between NT-proBNP and poor prognosis after ischemic stroke is still uncertain. The aim of this study was to examine whether serum NT-proBNP is associated with global clinical outcomes in a large cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: Baseline serum NT-proBNP level was measured in a subset of 3126 patients with acute ischemic stroke, and the patients were followed up to assess their clinical outcomes within 1 year after the stroke. Cox proportional hazard models and logistic regression models were used to assess the effects of NT-proBNP on the primary outcome (composite outcome of death and vascular events) and poor functional outcomes. Results: During 1 year of follow-up, 278 (9.0%) patients with a primary outcome and 685 (22.1%) patients with a poor functional outcome were identified. The cumulative incidence of primary outcomes increased across serum NT-proBNP quartiles (log-rank P &lt; 0.001). Hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile were 1.47 (1.01–2.13) for the primary outcome, 1.79 (1.07–2.98) for death after multivariable adjustment. In addition, serum NT-proBNP was also associated with poor functional outcomes (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.94; P trend = 0.008). Conclusions: This study showed that high NT-proBNP levels increased the risk of a composite outcome of death and vascular events and poor functional outcomes at 1 year after stroke onset among ischemic stroke patients with elevated blood pressure, suggesting that NT-proBNP might be a potential prognostic factor for ischemic stroke. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a palliative procedure frequently used in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined the national inpatient trends of TACE and related outcomes in the United States over the last decade. Methods We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (2002 to 2012) and performed trend analyses of TACE for HCC in all adult patients (age >18 years). Multivariate analyses for the outcomes of in-hospital “procedure-related complications” (PRCs) and “post-procedure complications” (PPCs) were performed. We also compared early (2002 to 2006) and late (2007 to 2012) eras by multivariate analyses to identify predictors of complications, healthcare resource utilization and mortality. Results Overall, 19058 patients underwent TACE for HCC where PRCs and PPCs were seen in 24.2% and 17.6% of patients, respectively. The overall trends in the use of TACE (P<0.001) and associated PRCs (P=0.006) were observed to be increasing. There was less mortality [adjusted Odds ratio (aOR): 0.58; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.82], reduced length of hospital stay (−1.87 days; 95% CI: −2.77, −0.97) and increased hospital charges ($19232; 95% CI: 11013, 27451) in the late era. Additionally, there was increased mortality (aOR: 4.07; 95% CI: 2.96, 5.59), PRCs (aOR: 3.21; 95% CI: 2.56, 4.02), and PPCs (aOR: 2.70; 95% CI: 2.11, 3.46) among patients with coagulopathy. Conclusions There is an increasing trend of TACE utilization in HCC. However, the outcomes are worse in patients with coagulopathy. Although PRCs have increased, mortality has decreased in recent years. These findings should be considered during TACE evaluation in patients with HCC. © 2017 The Editorial Board of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases International",

    "Abstract": "CD27, a member of the TNFR superfamily, is constitutively expressed in most T cells and plays crucial roles in T cell effector functions. The costimulation and antitumor activity of CD27 agonistic Abs have been well documented in mouse models. Clinical testing of a human IgG1 anti-CD27 Ab, varlilumab (clone 1F5), is ongoing in cancer patients. In this study, we set out to further understand CD27 as an immunomodulatory target and to address the mechanism of antitumor efficacy using different IgG isotypes of 1F5 in human CD27-transgenic mice. 1F5mIgG1, the only isotype engaging inhibitory FcgRIIB expressed in B cells, elicited the most potent and broad immune response, but terminal differentiation, exhaustion, and apoptosis in the activated effector T cells were inevitable. Accordingly, this isotype was the most effective in eradicating BCL1 lymphoma but had limited efficacy in s.c. Tumors. Conversely, 1F5mIgG2a, which interacts with cells expressing activating FcgRs, led to moderate immune activation, as well as to prominent reduction in the number and suppressive activity of regulatory T cells. These combined mechanisms imparted potent antitumor activity to 1F5mIgG2a, particularly against the s.c. Tumors. 1F5hIgG1, varlilumab, showed balanced agonistic activity that was prominent at lower doses and depleting activity that was greater at higher doses. 1F5hIgG1 had good antitumor activity in all tumor models tested. Thus, both agonist and depleting properties contribute to the antitumor efficacy of CD27-targeted immunotherapy, and modulation of these activities in patients may be achieved by varying the dose and regimen.

    "Abstract": "The female hormone 17 β-estradiol (E2) is synthesized from estrone by steroid sulfatase (STS), and metabolized into 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), whereby the biological activity of the latter is substantially different from that of E2. Based on the metabolic pathways of E2, a carborane-containing 2-ME mimic (1c) and its derivatives (1 and 2) were designed and synthesized as novel multitarget anticancer agents. Bissulfamate 1f exhibited potent STS-inhibitory activity and tubulin-polymerization-inhibitory activity. Moreover, the cell-growth-inhibitory (CGI) activity of 1f was similar to that of 2-ME in a panel screening against 39 human cancer cell lines. Accordingly, 1f should be a promising perspective therapeutic agent for hormone-dependent breast tissue. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Auranofin is a thiol-reactive gold (I)-containing compound with potential as a chemotherapeutic. Auranofin has the capacity to selectively inhibit endogenous antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), resulting in oxidative stress and the initiation of a pro-apoptotic cascade. The effect of Auranofin exposure on TrxR and GPx, and the potential for cellular protection through selenium supplementation was examined in the non-cancerous human cell line Swan-71. Auranofin exposure resulted in a concentration dependent differential inhibition of selenoprotein antioxidants. Significant inhibition of TrxR was observed at 20 nM Auranofin with inhibition of GPx from 10 µM. Significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) were associated with antioxidant inhibition at Auranofin concentrations of 100 nM (TrxR inhibition) and 10 µM (TrxR and GPx inhibition), respectively. Evaluation of mitochondrial respiration demonstrated significant reductions in routine and maximal respiration at both 100 nM and 10 μM Auranofin. Auranofin treatment at concentrations of 10 μM and higher concentrations resulted in a ∼68% decrease in cellular viability and was associated with elevations in pro-apoptotic markers cytochrome c flux control factor (FCFc) at concentration of 100 nM and mitochondrial Bax at 10 μM. The supplementation of selenium (100 nM) prior to treatment had a generalized protective affect through the restoration of antioxidant activity with a significant increase in TrxR and GPx activity, a significant reduction in ROS and associated improvement in mitochondrial respiration and cellular viability (10 µM ∼48% increase). Selenium supplementation reduced the FCFc at low doses of Auranofin (<10 μM) however no effect was noted on either FCFc or Bax at concentrations above 10 μM. The inhibition of antioxidant systems in non-cancerous cells by Auranofin is strongly dose dependent, and this inhibition can be altered by selenium exposure. Therefore, Auranofin dose and the selenium status of patients are important considerations in the therapeutic use of Auranofin as an agent of chemosensitization. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "A series of A-ring-modified lamellarin N analogues were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potential noncovalent inhibitors of the EGFR T790M/L858R mutant, a causal factor in the drug-resistant non-small cell lung cancer. Several water-soluble ammonium- or guanidinium-tethered analogues exhibited good kinase inhibitory activities. The most promising analogue, 14f, displayed an excellent inhibitory profile against the T790M/L858R mutant [IC50 (WT) = 31.8 nM; IC50 (T790M/L858R) = 8.9 nM]. The effects of A-ring-substituents on activity were rationalized by docking studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: The increasing use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has kindled the need for scientific evaluation of the mechanism of action of CAMs. Although, licorice, a common ingredient in many Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has attracted great attention for its antitumor and immunomodulatory activities, the mechanism of action of its polysaccharides is still unclear. Here we report the immunomodulatory activity of licorice polysaccharides in vivo. Methods: The differential anticancer activities of licorice polysaccharides by tumorigenesis and immunomodulation was evaluated in vivo. Six weeks old, 120 CT-26 tumor bearing BALB/c mice, weighing 20±2g were used. They were randomly divided into six groups, three groups receiving high molecular weight (fraction A), low molecular weight (fraction B) polysaccharides and crude extract (fraction C); positive, negative and normal groups receiving cytoxin, saline and normal diet respectively. Weight of mice and tumors was determined and tumorigenicity assay calculated to determine the anticancer effects. Immunomodulatory potential was determined by immune organ indices, immune cell population and serum cytokine levels using immune organ weight and index, flow cytometry and cytokine/chemokine bead panel kit respectively. Results: Licorice polysaccharides exhibited immunomodulatory activities in CT 26 tumor bearing BALB/c mice. The polysaccharides significantly suppressed tumor growth and increased immune organ index. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effect was evident with activation of CD4+ and CD8+ immune cells population. The polysaccharides also affected the production of various cytokines, by increasing IL 2, IL 6, IL 7 levels and a decreasing TNFα levels. Conclusion: In summary, licorice polysaccharide especially of low molecular weight exhibit anticancer and immunomodulatory activities by suppressing tumor growth and improving general health of mice. They also augment the thymus/spleen index and population of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the polysaccharides enhance the levels of serum antitumor cytokines, IL 2, IL 6 and IL 7 while decreasing pro-tumor cytokine TNFα. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Some sexually transmitted infectious agents, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Herpes simplex, cause local inflammation, and could contribute to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical lesion progression. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine any association between the presence of microorganisms of gynecological importance, sexual behavior, clinical and demographical variables to the development and progress of cervical lesions. Methods: One hundred and thirty-two women between 14 and 78 years and living at Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil, were included (62 individuals with cervical lesions and 70 without lesions). They answered a questionnaire to provide data for a socioeconomic and sexual activity profile. Samples of cervical swabs were collected and analyzed by PCR to detect genital microorganisms and HPV. Quantitative PCR was used to detect and quantify Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum. Univariate and multiple logistic regression were performed to measure the association with the cervical lesions, and an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. The Mann-Whitney U test was also used to compare the microorganism load in the case and control groups. The significance level was 5% in all hypotheses tested. Results: Cervical lesions were associated with: women in a stable sexual relationship (OR = 14.21, 95%CI = 3.67-55.018), positive PCR for HPV (OR = 16.81, 95%CI = 4.19-67.42), Trichomonas vaginalis (OR = 8.566, 95%CI = 2.04-35.94) and Gardnerella vaginalis (OR = 6.13, 95%CI = 1.53-24.61), adjusted by age and qPCR for U. parvum. U. parvum load showed a statistical difference between the case and control groups (p-value = 0.002). Conclusion: Variables such as stable relationship, HPV, T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis were associated with cervical lesions in epidemiological studies. U. parvum load was higher in woman with cervical lesions compared with women without lesions. Additional studies are needed to better understand the role of these factors in cervical lesion development. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Estrogen is a vital hormone that regulates many biological functions within the body. These include roles in the development of the secondary sexual organs in both sexes, plus uterine angiogenesis and proliferation during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy in women. The varied biological roles of estrogens in human health also make them a therapeutic target for contraception, mitigation of the adverse effects of the menopause, and treatment of estrogen-responsive tumours. In addition, endogenous (e.g. genetic variation) and external (e.g. exposure to estrogen-like chemicals) factors are known to impact estrogen biology. To understand how these multiple factors interact to determine an individual's response to therapy is complex, and may be best approached through a systems approach. Methods: We present a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) of estradiol, and validate it against plasma kinetics in humans following intravenous and oral exposure. We extend this model by replacing the intrinsic clearance term with: a detailed kinetic model of estrogen metabolism in the liver; or, a genome-scale model of liver metabolism. Both models were validated by their ability to reproduce clinical data on estradiol exposure. We hypothesise that the enhanced mechanistic information contained within these models will lead to more robust predictions of the biological phenotype that emerges from the complex interactions between estrogens and the body. Results: To demonstrate the utility of these models we examine the known drug-drug interactions between phenytoin and oral estradiol. We are able to reproduce the approximate 50% reduction in area under the concentration-time curve for estradiol associated with this interaction. Importantly, the inclusion of a genome-scale metabolic model allows the prediction of this interaction without directly specifying it within the model. In addition, we predict that PXR activation by drugs results in an enhanced ability of the liver to excrete glucose. This has important implications for the relationship between drug treatment and metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: We demonstrate how the novel coupling of PBPK models with genome-scale metabolic networks has the potential to aid prediction of drug action, including both drug-drug interactions and changes to the metabolic landscape that may predispose an individual to disease development. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Applications of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-, m-, and p-xylenes (BTEX) release them into the environment exposing living organism. These endocrine disruptors are toxic, highly volatile and easily absorbed by the lungs and can cause adverse consequences for the human health as neurological diseases and cancer. A method for the analysis of BTEX and its metabolites (phenols and aromatic acids) in teeth is presented. The method consists in a one-step simple extraction procedure from spiked tooth using NaOH solution followed by SPME-HPLC or HS-SPME-GC/MS determination. Optimization of both, spiking procedure and extraction step of these analytes from tooth, was carried out. Two fibers CAR/PDMS for BTEX and PA for BTEX metabolites were used for the SPME and variables were optimized for analytes at 30 °C using spiked solutions. The optimized adsorption times were 30, 75 and 30 min and desorption times were 10, 40 and 30 min for BTEX, phenols and aromatic acids, respectively. Linearity for SPME-HPLC method was established using spiked solutions with both, BTEX and metabolites, at 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 25.0 μg/mL. The obtained results indicated a good linearity (r2 above 0.994) for all analytes. Triplicate analyses were performed with RSD lower than 15%. LODs were in the range 0.2–33.3 ng/mL for SPME-HPLC and 0.06–0.09 pg/mL for HS-SPME-GC/MS methods in spiking solutions. Once the method was optimized, bovine teeth were used as biological matrix model for the tuning of spiking and extraction steps. Optimal adsorption and desorption times were 4 h for both procedures. Micrograms per tooth gram of BTEX and phenols were quantified in ten human teeth and aromatic acids were not identified. The developed method for BTEX and metabolites analyses using SPME-HPLC or HS-SPME-GC/MS shows good precision, linearity and sensitivity. The method was successfully applied in human teeth as environmental biomarker of BTEX and metabolites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background. Identification of fungi causing invasive fungal disease (IFD) is critical for guiding antifungal therapy. We describe the performance and clinical impact of a targeted panfungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon sequencing assay for culture-independent diagnosis of IFD. Methods. Between January 2009 and September 2016, 233 specimens, consisting of fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and sterile body fluids with known diagnosis of IFD based on reference method results (n = 117), and specimens with negative fungal culture, but with microscopic and ancillary findings indicative of IFD (n = 116), were included. PCR amplicons from the internal transcribed spacer 2 and the D2 region of 28S ribosomal RNA gene were sequenced and fungi identified. Results. Sensitivity and specificity of fungal sequencing in specimens with known diagnosis were 96.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.4%-99.4%; 58/60) and 98.2% (95% CI, 89.4%-99.9%; 56/57). In patients with suspected IFD, the diagnostic yield of fungal sequencing was 62.9% (73/116) overall and 71.3% (57/80) in patients classified with proven IFD based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Samples obtained by open biopsy had a significantly higher diagnostic yield (71.5% [40/56]) compared with core-needle biopsy (50% [17/34] P = .04) and fine needle aspiration (0% [0/2]; P = .009). Additionally, D2 sequencing diagnosed 5 cases of invasive protozoal infections due to Toxoplasma gondii (n = 3), Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania species. Sequencing results altered patient management in the majority of suspected cases. Conclusions. The targeted fungal sequencing assay allowed accurate identification of fungi causing IFD and additionally provided partial-protozoal coverage. The diagnostic yield was dependent on the amount of tissue available for testing. © 2017 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.",

    "Abstract": "Background Pioglitazone is an effective drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The drug was suspended from Indian market in June 2013 due to the risk of bladder cancer but was reintroduced in July 2013 because its benefits outweighed the risks. The risks associated with pioglitazone can be minimized if its dose is reduced. Hypothesis Ellagic acid, a polyphenolic antioxidant, is reported to reduce blood sugar in diabetic rats. The mechanism of anti-diabetic action of ellagic acid is not known. Drugs with same pharmacological action but different mechanism may act in synergistic way when combined together. The combination of ellagic acid with pioglitazone could enhance its activity and hence reduce its dose. Study design and methods Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of 175 mg of nicotinamide/kg body weight in combination with 65 mg of streptozotocin/kg body weight and then fed with high fat diet for 4 weeks (Group II-VII). Non-diabetic rats were fed with normal chow diet (Group I). Group I and II received vehicle only whereas group III to VII received ellagic acid, pioglitazone or their combination. The treatment was given orally once a day for 21 days. Results The induction of type 2 diabetes in rats caused increase in blood glucose, LDL, triglyceride, and cholesterol and decrease in HDL. The diabetic rats showed improvement in hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, liver and kidney function markers after treatment with ellagic acid, pioglitazone or their combinations. A combination of 10 mg of ellagic acid/kg BW with 10 mg of pioglitazone/kg BW resulted in significant improvement in all the biochemical parameters when compared to any of the individual treatment. The treatment of diabetic rats with the same combination significantly increased the expression levels of GLUT4, PPAR-γ and adiponectin in skeletal muscle. Conclusion The present study indicates that the dose of pioglitazone, required to achieve normoglycemia in diabetic rats, can be reduced by two folds by combining it with ellagic acid. The combinations reported here can be superior, since dose associated side effects and toxicity of the pioglitazone can be reduced. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",

    "Abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) generating carbon dioxide and NADPH/NADH. Evidence suggests that the specific mutations in IDH1 are critical to the growth and reproduction of some tumor cells such as gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia, emerging as an attractive antitumor target. In order to discovery potent new mutant IDH1 inhibitors, we designed, synthesized and evaluated a series of allosteric mIDH1 inhibitors harboring the scaffold of 3-pyrazine-2-yl-oxazolidin-2-ones. All tested compounds effectively suppress the D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) production in cells transfected with IDH1-R132H and IDH1-R132C mutations at 10 μM and 50 μM. Importantly, compound 3g owns the similar inhibitory activity to the positive agent NI-1 and shows no significant toxicity at the two concentrations. The parallel artificial membrane permeation assay of the blood–brain barrier (PAMPA-BBB) identified 3g with a good ability to penetrate the blood–brain barrier (BBB).

    "Abstract": "Thirty-six imidazolin-2-ones, including ten pairs of benzimidazolones and sixteen imidazopyridines, were synthesized and subjected for the evaluation of antifungal and antitumor activity. Compounds 4a-01, 6-01, 6-04 and 6-06 could effectively inhibit the spore germination and mycelium growth of Botrytis cinerea. The relationship between structure and antifungal activity revealed that the introducing short-chain aliphatic acyl groups at the moiety of imidazopyridines is favorable for the antifungal activity, whereas aromatic acyl groups are much better than aliphatic acyl groups for the activity of benzimidazolones except for acetyl. Preliminary SRB assay indicated that 6-01 exerted strong antiproliferative effect against Hela and NCM460 cell lines. Further kinases assay revealed that 6-01 could specially inhibit mTOR among 114 human cancer related kinases. Elisa and Western blot analysis testified that 6-01 simultaneously inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt and 4E-BP1, and 6-01 is a novel mTOR inhibitor which targets on both mTORC1 and mTORC2. This investigation provided a valuable chemical structure for the development of antitumor drugs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Inhibition of protein kinases is a validated concept for pharmacological intervention in cancers. Many kinase inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, but their practical application is often limited. Here, we describe a collection of 23 novel 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine derivatives with nanomolar inhibitory activities against PDGFRα, a receptor tyrosine kinase often found constitutively activated in various tumours. The compounds demonstrated strong and selective cytotoxicity in the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line EOL-1, whereas several other cell lines were substantially less sensitive. The cytotoxicity in EOL-1, which is known to express the FIP1L1‐PDGFRA fusion gene encoding an oncogenic kinase, correlated significantly with PDGFRα inhibition. EOL-1 cells treated with the compounds also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of PDGFRα autophosphorylation and suppression of its downstream signaling pathways with concomitant G1 phase arrest, confirming the proposed mechanism of action. Our results show that substituted purines can be used as platforms for preparing tyrosine kinase inhibitors with specific activity towards eosinophilic leukemia. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Over the last decades numerous initiatives have been set up that aim at translating the best available medical knowledge and treatment into clinical practice. The inherent complexity of the programs and discrepancies in the terminology used make it difficult to appreciate each of them distinctly and compare their specific strengths and weaknesses. To allow comparison and stimulate dialogue between different programs, we in this paper provide an overview of the German Cancer Society certification program for multidisciplinary cancer centers that was established in 2003. Main body: In the early 2000s the German Cancer Society assessed the available information on quality of cancer care in Germany and concluded that there was a definite need for a comprehensive, transparent and evidence-based system of quality assessment and control. This prompted the development and implementation of a voluntary cancer center certification program that was promoted by scientific societies, health-care providers, and patient advocacy groups and based on guidelines of the highest quality level (S3). The certification system structures the entire process of care from prevention to screening and multidisciplinary treatment of cancer and places multidisciplinary teams at the heart of this program. Within each network of providers, the quality of care is documented using tumor-specific quality indicators. The system started with breast cancer centers in 2003 and colorectal cancer centers in 2006. In 2017, certification systems are established for the majority of cancers. Here we describe the rationale behind the certification program, its history, the development of the certification requirements, the process of data collection, and the certification process as an example for the successful implementation of a voluntary but powerful system to ensure and improve quality of cancer care. Conclusion: Since 2003, over 1 million patients had their primary tumors treated in a certified center. There are now over 1200 sites for different tumor entities in four countries that have been certified in accordance with the program and transparently report their results from multidisciplinary treatment for a substantial proportion of cancers. This led to a fundamental change in the structure of cancer care in Germany and neighboring countries within one decade. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AIM To assess cancer-Testis antigens (CTAs) expression in gastric cancer patients and examined their associations with clinicopathological factors. METHODS Eighty-Three gastric cancer patients were evaluated in this study. Gastric cancer specimens were evaluated for the gene expression of CTAs, Kitakyushu lung cancer antigen-1 (KK-LC-1), melanoma antigen (MAGE)-A1, MAGE-A3 and New York esophageal cancer-1 (NYESO- 1), by reverse transcription PCR. Clinicopathological background information, such as gender, age, tumor size, macroscopic type, tumor histology, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and pathological stage, was obtained. Statistical comparisons between the expression of each CTA and each clinicopathological background were performed using the χ 2 test. RESULTS The expression rates of KK-LC-1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1 were 79.5%, 32.5%, 39.8%, and 15.7%, respectively. In early stage gastric cancer specimens, the expression of KK-LC-1 was 79.4%, which is comparable to the 79.6% observed in advanced stage specimens. The expression of KK-LC-1 was not significantly associated with clinicopathological factors, while there were considerable differences in the expression rates of MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3 with vs without lymphatic invasion (MAGE-A1, 39.3% vs 13.6%, P = 0.034; MAGE-A3, 47.5% vs 18.2%, P = 0.022) and/or vascular invasion (MAGE-A1, 41.5% vs 16.7%, P = 0.028; MAGE-A3, 49.1% vs 23.3%, P = 0.035) and, particularly, MAGE-A3, in patients with early vs advanced stage (36.5% vs 49.0%, P = 0.044), respectively. Patients expressing MAGE-A3 and NYESO- 1 were older than those not expressing MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 (MAGE-A3, 73.7 ± 7.1 vs 67.4 ± 12.3, P = 0.009; NY-ESO-1, 75.5 ± 7.2 vs 68.8 ± 11.2, P = 0.042). CONCLUSION The KK-LC-1 expression rate was high even in patients with stage I cancer, suggesting that KK-LC-1 is a useful biomarker for early diagnosis of gastric cancer. © The Author(s) 2017.

The relationship between MEG3 and miR-144, the role of downstream related pathways in the proliferation and metastasis of colon cancer and its mechanism were studied.METHODS Eighty case pathologically confirmed colon cancer tissues and 80 case adjacent normal tissues were collected during operation in Anhui Medical University First Affiliated Hospital from 2016-01-10 to 2017-01-10. The expressions of MEG3 in colon cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue were detected by qPCR. The association between clinical and pathological data of MEG3 and colon cancer patients were analyzed.Double luciferase reporter gene was used to detect the interaction between MEG3 and miR-144.MTT proliferation assay and Transwell invasion assay were used to detect the changes of proliferation and invasion ability of colon cancer cells after MEG3,and the inhibition of the colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion of the recovery after the inhibition of miR-144 expression.Western blotting was used to detect the expression of PTEN / AKT signaling pathway after MEG3. RESULTS Compared with other colon cancer cell lines, the expression of MEG3[(0.52±0.08), t=9.968,P<0.001] was the lowest and the expression level of miR-144 was the highest in SW620 cells[(1.25±0.11), t=9.648,P<0.05].The expression of MEG3 was related to the pathological stage of colon cancer and the lymph node metastasis. The higher the staging, the higher the expression of MEG3 in colon cancer.Double luciferase assay confirmed that MEG3 could specifically bind to the 3'UTR of miR-144 and regulate the expression and activity of miR-144. Inhibition of MEG3 expression can promote colon cancer cell proliferation[(3.52±0.59),t=3.289,P<0.05] and invasion [(321.52±23.24), t=15.900,P<0.001] ability.While the inhibition of miR-144 expression level, colon cancer cell proliferation[(3.63±0.48),t=4.303,P<0.05] and invasion ability [(89.52±8.19),t=15.327,P<0.001] had a certain degree of recovery; after inhibition of MEG3 expression, the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway was activated accordingly[PTEN(1.19±0.15)%,t=10.954,P<0.001; AKT(1.29±0.18)%,t=8.881,P<0.001 ].CONCLUSION MEG3 can regulate the expression of miR-144 and influence the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells through PTEN / AKT signaling pathway. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Combination cancer therapies aim to improve the probability and magnitude of therapeutic responses and reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance in an individual patient. However, drugs are tested in clinical trials on genetically diverse patient populations. We show here that patient-to-patient variability and independent drug action are sufficient to explain the superiority of many FDA-approved drug combinations in the absence of drug synergy or additivity. This is also true for combinations tested in patient-derived tumor xenografts. In a combination exhibiting independent drug action, each patient benefits solely from the drug to which his or her tumor is most sensitive, with no added benefit from other drugs. Even when drug combinations exhibit additivity or synergy in pre-clinical models, patient-to-patient variability and low cross-resistance make independent action the dominant mechanism in clinical populations. This insight represents a different way to interpret trial data and a different way to design combination therapies. Patient-to-patient variability in response to single drugs is sufficient to explain the efficacy of a large number of combination cancer therapies without pharmacologically additive or synergistic effect in individual patients. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Zinc finger protein 259 (ZNF259) is known to play essential roles in embryonic development and cell cycle regulation. However, its expression pattern and clinicopathological relevance remain unclear. Materials and methods: A total of 114 lung cancer specimens were collected. The ZNF259 expression was measured between the lung cancer tissues and the adjacent normal lung tissues by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Moreover, the correlation of ZNF259 expression with clinicopathological features was analyzed in 114 cases of lung cancer. Additionally, ZNF259 was depleted in the lung cancer cells in order to analyze its effect in the lung cancer. Results: Immunohistochemical staining of 114 lung cancer specimens revealed significantly lower ZNF259 expression in lung cancer tissues than in adjacent normal lung tissues (53.5% vs 71.4%, P<0.001). In addition, ZNF259 downregulation was significantly associated with larger tumor size (P=0.001), advanced TNM stage (P=0.002), and positive lymph node metastasis (P=0.02). Western blotting of 20 paired lung cancer samples revealed lower ZNF259 protein levels in lung cancer tissues than in those of corresponding normal lung tissues (P=0.0032). Depletion of ZNF259 resulted in enhanced levels of p-FAK and p-AKT, CyclinD1, and MMP2, which in turn increased the proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells. The effects of ZNF259 depletion were reversed by treatment with specific FAK or AKT inhibitors. Conclusion: ZNF259 depletion is correlated with the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and serves as a predictor of adverse clinical outcome in NSCLC patients. The inhibitory effect of ZNF259 on proliferation and invasion can be attributed to downregulation of CyclinD1 and MMP2 via inactivation of the FAK-AKT pathway. © 2017 Shan et al.",

    "Abstract": "The MDM2 and MDMX oncogenes are overexpressed in various types of human cancer and are highly associated with the initiation, progression, metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance of these diseases, including prostate cancer. The present study was designed to test a natural MDM2 inhibitor, Inulanolide A (InuA), for anti-prostate cancer activity and to determine the underlying mechanism(s) of action. InuA directly bound to the RING domains of both MDM2 and MDMX with high affinity and specificity and disrupted MDM2-MDMX binding, markedly enhancing MDM2 protein degradation. We further discovered that InuA bound to the DNA binding domain of NFAT1, resulting in marked inhibition of MDM2 transcription. InuA inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells, regardless of their p53 status and AR responsiveness. Double knockdown of MDM2 and NFAT1 also revealed that the expression of both of these molecules is important for InuA's inhibitory effects on the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells. In summary, InuA represents a novel class of bifunctional MDM2 inhibitors, and should be further investigated as a candidate lead compound for prostate cancer prevention and therapy. © 2017 Qin, Li, Wang, Zi and Zhang.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is being increasingly used in operable breast cancer patients. This study is to evaluate the improved New-bioscore system for prediction as a new methodology of prognosis evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in China.METHODS A total of 495 patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 08 July 2007 to 01 December 2013 were included. According to CPS + EG staging system (clinical-pathologic scoring system+estrogen receptor-negative disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology, CPS+EG) and improved New-bioscore system (clinical-pathologic scoring system + estrogen receptor-negative disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology+HER2 positive), each case was evaluated,followed by Kaplan Meier method to analyze the disease-specific survival (DSS) of breast cancer for different subgroups: clinical stage, pathologic stage, CPS+EG scores and improved new-bioscore.RESULTS The median follow-up time was 71 months. The five-year DSS rate for the entire study was 81% (95%CI: 77.08%-84.92%). The DSS rates were falling with the increased scores obtained from improved New-bioscore, The difference was statistically significant (χ 2 =34.618,P&lt;0.05). For breast cancer patients with clinical stage Ⅲ and pathologic stage Ⅲ and the patients who did not achieve pCR (non-pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the DSS rates was significantly lower as improved new-bioscore increase (χ 2 =33.018,P&lt;0.05). For breast cancer patients with HER2 either positive or negative, the DSS rates was significantly lower as improved new-bioscore increase (χ 2 =29.233,P&lt;0.05).According to the median improved New-bioscore scores, these cases were further divided into high-score group (&gt;3) and low-score group (≤ 3), and the DSS rates of high-score group were significantly lower than those of low-score group (χ 2 =43.201,P&lt;0.05). For breast cancer patients with clinical stage Ⅲ and pathologic stage Ⅲ and the patients who did not achieve pCR (non-pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the DSS rates of high-score group were significantly lower than those of low-score group (χ 2 =25.675,P&lt;0.05). For breast cancer patients with HER2 either positive or negative, the DSS rates of high-score group were significantly lower than those of low-score group (χ 2 =18.784,P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS The improved new-bioscore is employed to further optimize the staging and prognosis evaluation of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. This is beneficial for patients to determine the follow-up intensive adjuvant therapy, improve the survival and avoid excessive or insufficient treatment, which provide a decent reference for customized treatment of each breast cancer patient. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Ultrasound-(US) propelled nanowires consisting of Au/Ni/Au/PEDOT-PPy-COOH segments are modified with asparaginase enzyme and applied as an effective anti-cancer agent. After immobilization of asparaginase onto the surface of the nanowire motors, the enzyme displays enhanced thermal and pH stabilities, improved resistance towards protease, and higher affinity for the substrate. The fast motion of the motor-carrying asparaginase leads to greatly accelerated biocatalytic depletion of asparagine and hence to a significantly enhanced inhibition efficacy against El4 lymphoma cancer cells (92%) as compared to free enzyme counterpart (17%) and other control groups. Such enhanced enzymatic activity against cancer cells is attributed to the fast motion of the motors which facilitates the interaction between the enzyme and the cancer cells. While asparaginase and EL4 tumor cells are used as a model system in the present study for cancer cell inhibition, the same mechanism can be expanded to other types of enzymes and biomolecules for the corresponding biofunctions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Patients with advanced cervical cancer behave poor treatment compliance, are prone to adverse reactions, such as insomnia, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, depression, and so on. This study investigated the current status of depression in patients with cervical cancer received concurrent chemoradiotherapy and analyzed their influencing factors.METHODS A convenience sampling method was conducted to investigate the 217 patients with cervical cancer who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy from August 1, 2016 to May 30, 2017 in three class-3 first level hospitals in Hefei city using general situation questionnaire, family care index questionnaire (PAGAR), social support scale (SSRS) and Beck's self-rating depression scale (BDI).RESULTS Depression score was(20.93±8.81).The incidence of depression was 70.5%. Family PAGAR index score was(7.75±2.04). The total score of family PAGAR index and the scores of each dimension were negatively correlated with the scores of depression (r was from -0.428 to -0.298,P<0.01). The total score of social support total score was(36.78±6.65). The total score of social support and the scores of each dimension were negatively correlated with the scores of depression (r was from -0.453 to -0.265,P<0.01). Single factor analysis showed that family care, social support, family income, diagnostic grade, age, treatment, the number of medical staff health education guidance were all influencing factors for depression. The differences were statistically significant (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS Medical staff should attach great importance to the depression in patients with cervical cancer undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The intervention measures should be taken according to the influencing factors. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment. All right reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths. The mean age of patients with CRC ranges from 49 to 60 years. Pediatric CRC is unusual, which often escapes early diagnosis because of a lack of awareness of its occurrence in children. The association between the mutation of APC and the occurrence of CRC in the first decade of life remains unknown. Case presentation: We report a 10-year-old child with CRC; he was diagnosed with stage IIIB advanced transverse colon cancer without distal metastases. We detected a heterozygous germline mutation at c.5465 T>A in both blood and tissue samples and a heterozygous somatic mutation at c.7397C>T in the tissue sample. Both of these mutations can cause CRC tumorigenesis in the first decade of life. Conclusions: The rare genetic features of this 10-year-old patient might be the predisposing cause of pediatric CRC. Therefore, screening patients with early-onset CRC through clinical and genetic characterizations is suggested. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Colorectal cancer screening for community residents, which was the Shanghai major public health program, has benefited millions of people since 2013. This study aims to analyze the conditions of colorectal cancer screening among residents in Pudong New Area of Shanghai for providing a reference for the screening. METHODS The residents in the colorectal cancer screening of Pudong New Area in Shanghai were recruited in this analysis from 2013 to 2015. The conditions of community screening and early colonoscopy were analyzed, and the distribution of different groups in gender were compared in basic information of residents and diagnosis. RESULTS A total of 427 450 people have completed community colorectal cancer screening in Pudong new area from 2013 to 2015, 52.10%(222 688) in 2013, 22.21%(94 936) in 2014, and 25.69%(109 826) in 2015, including 173 644 men and 253 806 women, which were accounted for 40.62% and 59.38%; and 8 069 were under the age of 50, 368 974 were from 50 to 74 years old, and 50 407 were age of 75 and above, which were accounted for 1.89%, 86.32% and 11.79%, respectively. The positive of risk assessment were 43 347, the positive of Fecal Occult Blood test were 56 294 people, and the positive (risk assessment or single positive FOBT) of screening were 91 392. The positive rate in community colorectal cancer screening was 21.38%, and the positive rate in colonoscopy check was 21.98%(20 084 people participated in the colonoscopy). About 360 patients with colorectal cancer were screened out, and the early carcinoma discovery rate was 73.91% (170/230). The Pre-cancerous lesions were 2 096 cases, and the early detection rate was 97.16% in screening (2 260/2 326). CONCLUSION It is remarkable for the colorectal cancer screening in community residents of Pudong new area, and there remains something to be done for the gender difference, risk assessment, and economic bear ability to take some measures to optimize screening strategy, so as to improve the efficiency of the screening. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "AIM To evaluate the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in early esophageal cancer (EC) performed in a highvolume tertiary cancer center. METHODS A retrospective review of patients undergoing esophagectomy was performed and patients with cT1N0 and cT2N0 esophageal cancer by EUS were evaluated. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment were reviewed. EUS staging was compared to surgical pathology to determine accuracy of EUS. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the cohort. Student's t test and Fisher's exact test or χ 2 test was used to compare variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if clinical variables such as tumor location and tumor histology were associated with EUS accuracy. RESULTS Between 2000 and 2015, 139 patients with clinical stage ? or ? A esophageal cancer undergoing esophagectomy were identified. There were 25 (18%) female and 114 (82%) male patients. The tumor location included the middle third of the esophagus in 11 (8%) and lower third and gastroesophageal junction in 128 (92%) patients. Ninety-Three percent of patients had adenocarcinoma. Preoperative EUS matched the final surgical pathology in 73/139 patients for a concordance rate of 53%. Twenty-nine patients (21%) were under-staged by EUS; of those, 19 (14%) had unrecognized nodal disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used in addition to EUS for clinical staging in 62/139 patients. Occult nodal disease was only found in 4 of 62 patients (6%) in whom both EUS and PET were negative for nodal involvement. CONCLUSION EUS is less accurate in early EC and endoscopic mucosal resection might be useful in certain settings. The addition of PET to EUS improves staging accuracy. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer treatment remains a challenge for clinical practice and new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Loss of functional WEE1 kinase causes DNA replication stress, DNA damage and unscheduled mitotic entry due to elevated CDK activity. The selective WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 synergize with DNA-damaging agent to inhibit cancer cell growth. Here we report that inhibition of Sirt1 deacetylase through small interfering RNA or selective inhibitor Ex527 greatly enhances MK-1775-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. We further demonstrate that Sirt1 interacts and deacetylates homologous recombination (HR) repair machinery proteins, including NBS1 and Rad51. Inhibition of Sirt1 impairs HR repair activity, which causes unrepairable damage when combining MK-1775 and Ex527. Meanwhile, combination of MK-1775 and Ex527 induces cooperative antitumor activity in lung cancer xenograft model in vivo. Thus, our study provides a novel therapeutic strategy to optimize MK-1775 treatment efficiency in lung cancers. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Cellular glycosylation processes are vital to cell functioning. In malignant cells, they are profoundly altered. We used time-course gene expression data from the NCI-60 cancer cell lines treated with 11 antitumor agents to analyze expression changes of genes involved in glycosylation pathways, genes encoding glycosylation targets or regulators, and members of cancer pathways affected by glycosylation. We also identified glycosylation genes for which pretreatment expression levels or changes after treatment were correlated with drug sensitivity. Their products are involved in N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation, fucosylation, biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine, removal of misfolded proteins, binding to hyaluronic acid and other glycans, and cell adhesion. Tumor cell sensitivity to multiple agents was correlated with transcriptional response of C1GALT1C1, FUCA1, SDC1, MUC1; members of the MGAT, GALNT, B4GALT, B3GNT, MAN, and EDEM families; and other genes. These genes may be considered as potential candidates for drug targeting in combination therapy to enhance treatment response. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: A novel systemic immune–inflammation index named SII (SII=N×P/L), which is based on neutrophil (N), platelet (P) and lymphocyte (L) counts, has emerged and reflects comprehensively the balance of host inflammatory and immune status. We aimed to evaluate the potential prognostic significance of SII in patients with advanced gastric cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Subjects and methods: The retrospective analysis included data from 107 patients with advanced gastric cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 185 patients with pathology-proven gastric cancer. The optimal cutoff value of SII by receiver operating characteristic curve stratified patients into low SII (&lt;600×109/L) and high SII (SII ≥600×109/L) groups. The clinical outcomes of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated by Kaplan–Meier survival curves and compared using log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the prognostic value of SII. Results: The results indicated that SII had prognostic significance using the cutoff value of 600×109/L on DFS and OS in univariate and multivariate Cox regression survival analyses. Low SII was associated with prolonged DFS and OS, and the mean DFS and OS for patients with low SII were longer than for those with high SII (57.22 vs 41.56 months and 62.25 vs 45.60 months, respectively). Furthermore, we found that patients with low SII had better 1-, 3- and 5-year rates of DFS and OS than those with high SII. In addition, patients with low SII were likely to receive DFS and OS benefits from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy. Conclusion: SII may qualify as a noninvasive, cost-effective, convenient and reproducible prognostic indicator for patients with advanced gastric cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It may help clinicians to identify those patients who will benefit from treatment strategy decisions. © 2017 Chen et al.",

    "Abstract": "A series of hybrid compounds was designed to target histone deacetylases and ds-/G-quadruplex DNAs by merging structural features deriving from Scriptaid and compound 1. Compound 6 binds different DNA arrangements, inhibits HDACs both in vitro and in cells, and is able to induce a reduction of cell proliferation. Moreover, compound 6 displays cell phenotype-reprogramming properties since it prevents the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, inducing a less aggressive and migratory phenotype, which is one of the goals of present innovative strategies in cancer therapies. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Large-scale transcriptome sequencing efforts have vastly expanded the catalog of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with varying evolutionary conservation, lineage expression, and cancer specificity. Here, we functionally characterize a novel ultraconserved lncRNA, THOR (ENSG00000226856), which exhibits expression exclusively in testis and a broad range of human cancers. THOR knockdown and overexpression in multiple cell lines and animal models alters cell or tumor growth supporting an oncogenic role. We discovered a conserved interaction of THOR with IGF2BP1 and show that THOR contributes to the mRNA stabilization activities of IGF2BP1. Notably, transgenic THOR knockout produced fertilization defects in zebrafish and also conferred a resistance to melanoma onset. Likewise, ectopic expression of human THOR in zebrafish accelerated the onset of melanoma. THOR represents a novel class of functionally important cancer/testis lncRNAs whose structure and function have undergone positive evolutionary selection. An ultraconserved lncRNA promotes oncogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Overexpression of DNMT1 and KIT is prevalent in lung cancer, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. While the deregulated activation of DNMT1 or KIT has been implicated in lung cancer pathogenesis, whether and how DNMT1 and KIT orchestrate lung tumorigenesis are unclear. Here, using human lung cancer tissue microarrays and fresh frozen tissues, we found that the overexpression of DNMT1 is positively correlated with the upregulation of KIT in tumor tissues. We demonstrated that DNMT1 and KIT form a positive regulatory loop, in which ectopic DNMT1 expression increases, whereas targeted DNMT1 depletion abrogates KIT signaling cascade through Sp1/miR-29b network. Conversely, an increase of KIT levels augments, but a reduction of KIT expression ablates DNMT1 transcription by STAT3 pathway leading to in-parallel modification of the DNA methylation profiles. We provided evidence that KIT inactivation induces global DNA hypomethylation, restores the expression of tumor suppressor p15(INK4B) through promoter demethylation; in turn, DNMT1 dysfunction impairs KIT kinase signaling. Functionally, KIT and DNMT1 co-expression promotes, whereas dual inactivation of them suppresses, lung cancer cell proliferation and metastatic growth in vitro and in vivo, in a synergistic manner. These findings demonstrate the regulatory and functional interplay between DNA methylation and tyrosine kinase signaling in propelling tumorigenesis, providing a widely applicable approach for targeting lung cancer. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

    "Abstract": "The problems of resistance to apoptosis-inducing drugs, recurrence, and metastases that have bedeviled cancer treatment have been attributed to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumors, and there is currently no clinically indicated drug for their eradication. We previously reported that glycosylated antitumor ether lipids (GAELs) display potent activity against CSCs. Here, we show that by carefully modulating the amphiphilic nature of a monoamine-based GAEL, we can generate a potent triamino scaffold that is active against a panel of hard-to-kill epithelial cancer cell lines (including triple-negative breast) and BT474 CSCs. The most active compound of this set, which acts via a nonmembranolytic, nonapoptotic caspase-independent mechanism, is more effective than cisplatin and doxorubicin against these cell lines and more potent than salinomycin against BT474 CSCs. Understanding the combination of factors crucial for the enhanced cytotoxicity of GAELs opens new avenues to develop potent compounds against drug-resistant cancer cells and CSCs. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer incidence is rising and this global challenge is further exacerbated by tumour resistance to available medicines. A promising approach to meet the need for improved cancer treatment is drug repurposing. Here we highlight the potential for repurposing disulfiram (also known by the trade name Antabuse), an old alcohol-aversion drug that has been shown to be effective against diverse cancer types in preclinical studies. Our nationwide epidemiological study reveals that patients who continuously used disulfiram have a lower risk of death from cancer compared to those who stopped using the drug at their diagnosis. Moreover, we identify the ditiocarb-copper complex as the metabolite of disulfiram that is responsible for its anti-cancer effects, and provide methods to detect preferential accumulation of the complex in tumours and candidate biomarkers to analyse its effect on cells and tissues. Finally, our functional and biophysical analyses reveal the molecular target of disulfiram's tumour-suppressing effects as NPL4, an adaptor of p97 (also known as VCP) segregase, which is essential for the turnover of proteins involved in multiple regulatory and stress-response pathways in cells. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

    "Abstract": "Objective: Rare co-existance of disease or pathology Background: Dermatopathic lymphadenitis is a rare benign lymphatic hyperplasia commonly associated with exfoliative or eczematoid dermatitis. Of interest, this condition can be confused with lymphatic metastasis in adults. Case Report: In this report, we describe the case of a 56-year-old woman diagnosed with left breast invasive ductal carcinoma in remission, who presented with dermatopathic lymphadenitis mimicking breast cancer recurrence. Conclusions: Dermatopathic lymphadenitis is a benign entity that needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy. Pursuing extensive workup in asymptomatic patients with a similar presentation and initial negative tests for malignancy recurrence is not recommended. © Am J Case Rep, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE The difference of tumor hypoxia and tumor volume can result in the different curative effects to the same treatment. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the response discrepancy to systemic chemotherapy of primary and corresponding metastasis lesions in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Patients of advanced NSCLC complicated with intrapulmonary or corresponding mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis were admitted in this cohort between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016. Totally 978 patients were considered eligible and platinum-based two-drug systemic chemotherapy regimens were undergone for two cycles. Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) was used to assess the shrink of both primary and metastasis lesions, and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent impact factors of the response to systemic chemotherapy in both primary and corresponding metastasis lesions. RESULTS Our results indicated that the intrapulmonary (P=0.020) and mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis lesions got a better shrink (P<0.001) compared to primary lesion of these patients when undergone systemic chemotherapy. Univariate logistic analysis indicated that gender (OR=0.647, 95%CI=0.485-0.864, P=0.035), smoking (OR=1.326, 95%CI=1.014-1.773, P=0.046), histology of squamous (OR=0.646, 95%CI=0.493-0.844, P=0.002) also the location of primary lesion (OR=0.673, 95%CI=0.521-0.869, P=0.003) could influence the shrink discrepancy in primary and corresponding metastasis lesions, nevertheless, the multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated that the primary lesion only in central type carcinoma (P=0.028) as well asand the squamous carcinoma subgroups (P=0.026) as had a poorer response to systemic chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Intrapulmonary or mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis lesions had better response to chemotherapy compared to primary lesions in advanced NSCLC patients, which provided as the basis for the choose of optimal treatments in the subgroup of patients except distant metastasis with advanced NSCLC. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Vps34, a class III PtdIns3 lipid kinase involved in the control of both autophagic and endocytic systems, has been studied extensively in numerous fundamental cellular processes. Accumulating evidence indicates that Vps34 may also contribute to the development and progression of human cancers. However, the mechanism of Vps34 in tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we report an unanticipated role of Vps34 in the activation of p62 for cancer development. We identified that Vps34 is a transcriptional activator of p62 through competition of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) for Keap1 binding. Vps34 augments the association of PKC-δ with p62 for its phosphorylation at Serine 349, which leads to positive feedback on the Nrf2-dependent transcription of oncogenes. Additionally, we found that the expression of Vps34 is correlated with the tumorigenic activity of human breast cancer cells. Normally inactive in breast cancer, caspase 8 can cleave Vps34 at residue D285, which directly abolished its lipid kinase activity and dramatically altered cell invasion potential, colony formation, as well as tumorigenesis in orthotopic engraftments in mice. The cleavage at D285 blocks expression of LC3-II, Nrf2 and subsequently, p62, in addition to blocking tumor growth, indicating that the intact structure of Vps34 is essential for its activity. Moreover, either knockout of PKC-δ or knockdown of p62 by small interfering RNA in MCF-7 cells abrogates Vps34-dependent tumor growth. Data presented here suggested that Vps34 stimulates tumor development mainly through PKC-δ- activation of p62. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE KRAS-mutant CRC patients are resistant to cetuximab treatment. In order to benefit more patients from cetuximab targeted therapy, this study aims to investigate the effect of simvastatin on resensitizing cetuximab-resistant human CRC cells in vitro. METHODS The KRAS mutant DLD-1 cells were randomly divided into four groups: normal, cetuximab (150μg/mL), simvastatin (0.2μg/mL) and cetuximab plus simvastatin. Then cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay; cell apoptosis was dectected by flow cytometry; cell cloning ability was determined by colony formation assay; cell invasion was detected by Transwell assay; the expressions of BRAF, p-ERK1/2, Bcl-xl, Bad, caspase-3 were determined by Western blot. RESULTS MTT assay showed that the proliferation rate of DLD-1 cells stimulated by four methods respectively were (100.00±0.00)%, (90.70±1.30)%,(88.00±0.60)% and (72.00±1.20)%. Simvastatin plus cetuximab contrasting to cetuximab alone could significantly reduce the cell proliferation, and there was great interactional effect between these two drugs, F=22.39,P<0.001. Colony formation showed that the cloning rate of cetuximab group and simvastatin plus cetuxiamb gruop were respectively (87.05±2.47)% and (52.28±1.51)%, F=197.86,P<0.001. Flow cytometry showed that simvastatin combined with cetuximab could significantly induce the cell apoptosis rate, which was increased from (9.36±0.33)% to (26.16±2.91)%, F=63.97,P<0.001. Transwell assay showed the invasion rate was significantly reduced when simvastatin combined with cetuximab, which was decreased from (127.45±17.06)% to (42.22±4.78)%, F=37.59, P<0.001. Western blot results showed that BRAF and p-ERK1/2 expressions were decreased, which inhibited the MAPK signaling pathway. The expressions of apoptosis protein such as Bcl-xl, procaspase-3 were down regulated, while Bad and Cleaved caspase-3 were up regulated. CONCLUSIONS Simvastatin combines with cetuximab may siginificantly inhibit the DLD-1 cell proliferation, colony formation and cell invasion, which may be related to the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway, the activation of apoptosis related proteins and apoptosis induction. These may effectively reverse the cetuximab resistance. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment. All right reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study was aimed at investigating whether metformin can reverse the resistance of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin and exploring the underlying mechanism. Methods: Ovarian cancer cell proliferation in vitro was evaluated using a CCK-8 assay. The resistance index of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells was determined and cell cycle and apoptosis rate determined by annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining in CP70 cells. Western blotting was used to determine IGF1, IGF1R, AKT, p-IGF1, p-IGF1R, p-AKT, and MRP2 levels in cells treated with different concentrations of metformin and LY29400, an inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor pathway. Changes in gene expression levels of MRP2, IGF1, IGF1R, and AKT were determined by fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR assay of CP70 cells treated with metformin. Tumors of human ovarian cancer cell lines CP70 and A2780 were established by subcutaneous transplantation of cells in nude mice and the effect of metformin on MRP2 expression and tumor inhibition assessed. Results: The IC50 value of cisplatin in CP70 cells decreased significantly as metformin concentration increased (P &lt; 0.05). The cell cycle distribution in CP70 cells changed with metformin treatment; the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase, as well as the natural apoptosis rate was significantly increased with metformin treatment (P &lt; 0.05). IGF1, IGF1R, AKT p-IGF1, p-IGF1R, and p-Akt protein expression was enhanced dose-dependently with metformin, and was also significantly changed by treatment of CP70 cells with 0 mM metformin +10 mM LY294002. Moreover, changes in the expression of MRP2, IGF1, IGF1R, and AKT was metformin-concentration dependent, and was significantly different from that in the untreated control group (P &lt; 0.05). In nude mice, the tumor volumes of the cisplatin-treated groups were significantly less than in the control group, and was further suppressed by co-treatment with cisplatin and metformin (P &lt; 0.05), indicating that these 2 drugs had a synergistic effect on tumor inhibition. Conclusion: Metformin can improve the sensitivity of ovarian cancer CP70 cells to cisplatin in a concentration-dependent manner by activating the AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting the IGF1R signaling pathway, and reducing MRP2 expression. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor hypoxia has been widely explored over the years as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker. Herein, we synthesized an alkyne functionalized version of evofosfamide, a hypoxia-selective prodrug. The purpose of this effort was to investigate if this novel 2-nitroimidazole phosphoramide nitrogen mustard (2-NIPAM) retained hypoxia selectivity and could be utilized in radiopharmaceutical development to significantly increase retention of conjugated agents in hypoxic cells. 2-NIPAM demonstrated good hypoxia selectivity with a 62- and 225-fold increase in cytotoxicity toward PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines, respectively, under hypoxic conditions. Radiolabeling of 2-NIPAM with 125I was accomplished through a Cu(I)-mediated azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. The 125I-conjugate demonstrated 13.6 and 17.8% lower efflux rates for DU145 and PC-3 cells, correspondingly, under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that the increased retention is likely due to the known intracellular trapping mechanism.

    "Abstract": "A hallmark of cancer is unbridled proliferation that can result in increased demand for de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases required for DNA and RNA biosynthesis. These synthetic pathways are frequently upregulated in cancer and involve various folate-dependent enzymes. Antifolates have a proven record as clinically used oncolytic agents. Our recent research efforts have produced LSN 3213128 (compound 28a), a novel, selective, nonclassical, orally bioavailable antifolate with potent and specific inhibitory activity for aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICARFT), an enzyme in the purine biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition of AICARFT with compound 28a results in dramatic elevation of 5-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (ZMP) and growth inhibition in NCI-H460 and MDA-MB-231met2 cancer cell lines. Treatment with this inhibitor in a murine based xenograft model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) resulted in tumor growth inhibition. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtype of breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of BC. A number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in cancer biology, including BC. Previous lncRNA profiling studies have focused only on triple-negative BC and HER 2-positive BC, and no studies have specifically focused on lncRNAs in ER-positive BC. In this study, we analyzed the expression profile of the lncRNAs and mRNAs found in this particular subtype of BC for the first time. Methods: We evaluated lncRNA microarray data from four pairs of primary BC and adjuvant nontumor breast tissues. Then, we screened out the differently expressed genes and measured the correlation of the expression levels of lncRNAs and ERalpha by Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis. We also performed classification and length distribution of the dysregulated lncRNAs. KEGG pathway analysis was used to understand the biological roles of these differently expressed genes. lncRNA–mRNA coexpression networks were constructed. Finally, RT-PCR was employed to validate the microarray analysis findings. Results: We screened out 2,178 differently expressed lncRNAs, and 13 lncRNAs were found to be associated with the ER expression level. Classification analysis showed that most lncRNAs belonged to intergenic lncRNA and were from 400 to 800 nt in length. Chromosome distribution showed that many of the lncRNAs were mapped to chromosome 1. In the pathway analysis, most of the genes were related to cancer-associated behaviors, such as p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, focal adhesion, and ECM–receptor interaction. lncRNA–mRNA coexpression networks were constructed, and the lncRNAs related to ESR1, BRCA1, and BRCA2 in the two groups were significantly different. The RT-PCR results were consistent with the data obtained from the microarrays. Conclusion: These results provide useful information for exploring potential novel biomarkers as diagnosis and therapy targets for the clinical treatment of ER-positive BC. © 2017 Peng et al.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Compared with IMRT, VMAT for non-small cell lung cancer usually reduces the irradiation volume in the middle and high dose areas of lung, but increases the irradiation volume in the low dose area of lung. This study is to investigate the dosimetric characteristics of a hybrid irradiation technique which combines IMRT and VMAT in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The aim is to reduce the irradiation dose volume of lung, prevent the occurrence of radiation-induced lung injury(RILI) and improve the quality of life of the patients. METHODS Hybrid-IMRT/VMAT, VMAT and IMRT plans were designed in each of 12 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent radiotherapy for the first course between August 1st, 2016 and May 31st, 2017 at the Department of Radiotherapy of Qinghai University Affiliated Hospital, and the prescription dose was 60Gy/30f. The H-IMRT/VMAT plan was compared with VMAT and IMRT to evaluate target dose distribution and OARs dose volume parameters. RESULTS The PTV homogeneity index (HI) of H-IMRT/VMAT, VMAT and IMRT were 0.077±0.014, 0.044±0.012 and 0.070±0.022(P&lt;0.001; P=0.082), and the PTV conformity index (CI) were 0.815±0.033, 0.846±0.041 and 0.811±0.039(P=0.012; P=0.814). The HI and CI of PTV of VMAT were the best, while H-IMRT/VMAT was equivalent to IMRT. H-IMRT/VMAT was better than the other two plans in lung protection. The mean lung dose (MLD), V 5 and V 10 of lung in H-IMRT/VMAT [(13.42±2.25) Gy, (55.47±10.75)% and (36.58±8.69)%] were better than that of VMAT [(14.56±2.36) Gy, (63.07±9.57)% and (47.62±8.92%)], the difference was statistically significant(P&lt;0.001; P=0.001), and V 20 of lung in H-IMRT/VMAT [(21.57±4.77)%] was superior to IMRT [(23.51±4.49)%], the difference was statistically significant (P=0.006). The V 30 , V 40 of lung and heart in H-IMRT/VMAT were not statistically different from those of the other two plans (P&gt;0.05). The Dmax of spinal cord in H-IMRT/VMAT [(34.54±6.60) Gy] was slightly lower than that in VMAT [(35.60±4.24) Gy], the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.303), and compared with IMRT [(36.19±5.63) Gy], the difference was statistically significant (P=0.038). CONCLUSION The target dose distribution of H-IMRT/VMAT plan is close to IMRT plan. Compared with VMAT and IMRT, H-IMRT/VMAT has obvious advantages in decreasing the low and middle dose areas (V 20 , V 10 , V 5 ) of lung and MLD, which can better pretect lung. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE With the continuous deepening of tumor treatment with precision and minimally invasive concept, local thermal ablation therapy is becoming more and more important in the treatment of liver cancer. This article summarizes the change before and after Radiofrequency and Microwave ablation of primary hepatic carcinoma patients and conduct thermal ablation effects on the immune function of patients with PHC. METHODS PubMed, Medline and CNKI have been employed to search for related literature published between 2001-01 and 2017-05 using terms of hepatocellular carcinoma, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation and immune function. A total of 36 English papers and 10 Chinese papers were searched. Eligibility criteria: 1) body's normal anti-tumor immune response; 2) changes in the immune function of patients with PHC; 3)radiofrequency and microwave ablation of liver cancer; 4)ablation effects and related mechanisms on the immune function of patients with PHC. Forty-six pieces of eligible documents have been included into the investigation. RESULTS Radiofrequency and microwave ablation as representative of local minimally invasive treatments have been widely used in clinical practice. Compared with surgical resection, ablation therapy can not only directly inactivate tumor cells and destroy tumor tissues which causing irreversible coagulation necrosis, but also affect the expression of immune cells and cytokines after treatment. The ratio of CD4 + , CD4 + /CD8 + and NK cells after the treatment was higher than that of before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant; the ratio of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T lymphocytes decreased, and the difference was statistically significant; at the same time, the proportion of Th1/Th2 of the helper T cells was adjusted, and the level of Th1 cytokines increased, the level of Th2 cytokines decreased, and the difference was statistically significant compared with the normal control group. CONCLUSION As local thermal ablation is used to treat tumors, it also can improve the tumor microenvironment, alleviate the inhibition of anti-tumor immunity, improve immune function, and reduce recurrence and metastasis. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "A pH and glutathione (GSH) dual bio-relevant triggered supramolecular system is constructed through the non-covalent host-guest interactions between the adamantane (ADA) on camptothecin (CPT) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the side chain of the backbone of hyaluronic acid (HA). The obtained non-covalent supramolecular β-CD-g-OX-HA/ADA-CPT complex could further self-assemble into a stable uniform sphere micellar structure with constant drug loading content in the extracellular environment but is cleaved in the cytosol of the cancer cells due to the acidic environment and the presence of a high concentration of GSH, resulting in a synergistic-fast pH and GSH triggered drug releasing behavior. The cytotoxicity of the supramolecular β-CD-g-OX-HA/ADA-CPT micelles was investigated using Hep G2 cancer cells by MTT assays, which displayed that supramolecular β-CD-g-OX-HA/ADA-CPT micelles had exhibited enhanced cellular proliferation inhibition against Hep G2 cancer cells compared to the free CPT, while the β-CD-g-OX-HA had good cell compatibility. In vivo studies of the β-CD-g-OX-HA/ADA-CPT micelles showed a higher in vivo efficacy without side effects and also confirmed the compatibility of the β-CD-g-OX-HA. It is anticipated that this supramolecular complex will give the possibility to fabricate new types of bio-relevant triggered nanocarriers for cancer therapy. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE JTC-801 is a selective antagonist for NOP 〔Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide〕 receptor, suitable for neuropathic pain and abnormal pain associated with nerve injury. There is none research about effect of JTC-801 on tumor. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of JTC-801 on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of colon cancer HCT116 and HT-29 cells, and to explore the relevant mechanisms. METHODS CCK8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry were adopted to detect cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and PI3K-related proteins. RESULTS CCK8 assay showed that JTC-801 treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 and HT-29 cells with a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Transwell assay showed that 10μmol/L JTC-801 treatment significantly inhibited migration of HCT116 and HT-29 cells [(44±2) vs (96±5), t=16.72,P= 0.000 1; (45±4) vs (93±7), t=10.32,P=0.005]. JTC-801 treatment also significantly inhibited invasion of HCT116 and HT-29 cells [(21±5) vs (43±3), N=3,t=6.54,P=0.002 8; (23±3) vs (40±2), t=8.17, P=0.001 2]. Flow cytometry results showed that JTC-801 promoted apoptosis of HCT116 and HT-29 cells [(13.74±0.42)% vs (4.73±0.33)%, t=29.23,P<0.001; (18.59±0.39) % vs (8.51±0.57)%, t=25.28,P<0.001], and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreased significantly, while the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and Active Caspase3 were significantly increased (P<0.05). JTC-801 treatment also significantly inhibited the expression of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p70s6k protein (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS JTC-801 can inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion and promote apoptosis of colon cancer, which may be achieved by affecting the activation of PI3K pathway. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Natural polyphenols are organic chemicals which contain phenol units in their structures. They show antitumor properties. However, a key problem is their short half-life and low bioavailability under in vivo conditions. Still, definitively demonstrating the human benefits of isolated polyphenolic compounds (alone or in combination) using modern scientific methodology has proved challenging. The most common discrepancy between experimental and clinical observations is the use of nonphysiologically relevant concentrations of polyphenols in mechanistic studies. Thus, it remains highly controversial how applicable underlying mechanisms are with bioavailable concentrations and biological half-life. The present Perspective analyses proposed antitumor mechanisms, in vivo reported antitumor effects, and possible mechanisms that may explain discrepancies between bioavailability and bioefficacy. Polyphenol metabolism and possible toxic side effects are also considered. Our main conclusion emphasizes that these natural molecules (and their chemical derivatives) indeed can be very useful, not only as cancer chemopreventive agents but also in oncotherapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "A novel and sensitive RF magnetron sputtered tin oxide (SnO 2 ) thin film based breast cancer immunosensor that combines exquisite sensitivity, rapid determination and specificity with a simple, inexpensive and easy-to-use technology has been realized. A SnO 2 thin film based biocompatible matrix has been used for immobilization of breast cancer specific antibody CA 15-3 by a physical adsorption technique for an efficient detection of breast cancer antigen CA 15-3. The fabricated immunoelectrode (antibody CA 15-3 (Ab)/SnO 2 /Pt/Ti/glass) has been characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The optimal equivalent circuit model that matches the impedimetric responses of the immunoelectrode describes three distinct regions: the electrolyte solution resistance (R s ), the double layer capacitance (C dl ) and the specific charge transfer resistance (R ct ). The SnO 2 thin film based immunosensor produces a decrease in the peak oxidation current in CV and DPV studies due to the steric hindrance caused by the macromolecular antibody. The immunoelectrode (Ab/SnO 2 /Pt/Ti/glass) exhibits a linear increase in electrochemical impedance response upon combining with the specific antigen CA 15-3, in a wide range of antigen concentration from 50 ng dL -1 to 700 ng dL -1 (8 U mL -1 to 120 U mL -1 ) with a R ct sensitivity of 38.63 (ng dL -1 ) -1 , fast response time and a high shelf life of more than 20 weeks. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, is a traditional oriental medicine used to treat diarrhea and gastroenteritis. Recently, we reported that it could inhibit the growth of intestinal polyp in animals and in patients with the familial adenomatous polyposis by downregulating β-catenin signaling. However, the intracellular target mediating the effects of berberine remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence that berberine inhibits β-catenin function via directly binding to a unique region comprising residues Gln275, Arg316 and Arg371 in nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), where berberine concomitantly binding to and synergistically activating RXRα with 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), a natural ligand binding to the classical ligand-binding pocket of RXRα. Berberine binding promotes RXRα interaction with nuclear β-catenin, leading to c-Cbl mediated degradation of β-catenin, and consequently inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, berberine suppresses the growth of human colon carcinoma xenograft in nude mice in an RXRα-dependent manner. Together, our study not only identifies RXRα as a direct protein target for berberine but also dissects their binding mode and validates that berberine indeed suppresses β-catenin signaling and cell growth in colon cancer via binding RXRα, which provide new strategies for the design of new RXRα-based antitumor agents and drug combinations. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "The chaperone protein and guanine nucleotide exchange factor SmgGDS (RAP1GDS1) is a key promoter of cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. SmgGDS undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, suggesting that it has both cytoplasmic and nuclear functions that promote cancer. Previous studies indicate that SmgGDS binds cytoplasmic small GTPases and promotes their trafficking to the plasma membrane. In contrast, little is known about the functions of SmgGDS in the nucleus, or how these nuclear functions might benefit cancer cells. Here we show unique nuclear localization and regulation of gene transcription pathways by SmgGDS. Strikingly, SmgGDS depletion significantly reduces expression of over 600 gene products that are targets of the DREAM complex, which is a transcription factor complex that regulates expression of proteins controlling the cell cycle. The cell cycle regulators E2F1, MYC, MYBL2 (B-Myb) and FOXM1 are among the DREAM targets that are diminished by SmgGDS depletion. E2F1 is well known to promote G1 cell cycle progression, and the loss of E2F1 in SmgGDS-depleted cells provides an explanation for previous reports that SmgGDS depletion characteristically causes a G1 cell cycle arrest. We show that SmgGDS localizes in nucleoli, and that RNAi-mediated depletion of SmgGDS in cancer cells disrupts nucleolar morphology, signifying nucleolar stress. We show that nucleolar SmgGDS interacts with the RNA polymerase I transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF). The RNAi-mediated depletion of UBF diminishes nucleolar localization of SmgGDS and promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of SmgGDS, indicating that nucleolar sequestration of SmgGDS by UBF stabilizes SmgGDS protein. The ability of SmgGDS to interact with UBF and localize in the nucleolus is diminished by expressing DiRas1 or DiRas2, which are small GTPases that bind SmgGDS and act as tumor suppressors. Taken together, our results support a novel nuclear role for SmgGDS in protecting malignant cells from nucleolar stress, thus promoting cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Drug delivery systems integrated with dual or multi-functionalities of stimuli-responsiveness, targeted and controlled release, and bioimaging are favorable in improving the efficiency of chemotherapy. In this study, the amphiphilic block copolymers of poly(TMC-co-DTM)-SS-POEGMA were synthesized via a combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of oligo(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA) and ring opening polymerization (ROP) of two monomers (trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and N3-functional cyclic carbonate monomer (Carb-N3)) on a bifunctional initiator, followed by \"click\" post-functionalization with alkyne-dithiomaleimide (DTM). The obtained copolymers possessed stimuli-sensitive characteristics and bright fluorescence properties, crucial in achieving the desired therapeutic efficiency. The core-labeled micelles (CLMs) obtained from poly(TMC-co-DTM)-SS-POEGMA showed desirable fluorescence characteristics compared to the alkyne-DTM monomer. Therefore, the material was used directly in cellular uptake studies and exhibited clear green fluorescence. Moreover, the camptothecin (CPT)-loaded CLMs were shown to be stable in aqueous solution and dissociated into their hydrophobic and hydrophilic components in a thiol-rich environment to release CPT. Due to the dual functionalities of reduction-responsiveness and fluorescence, these nanoparticles based on novel poly(TMC-co-DTM)-SS-POEGMA exhibited promising characteristics to be potentially used in cancer chemotherapy. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced liver necrosis takes great part in liver cirrhosis progression. However, less is known about whether hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has effect on liver fibrosis. Here, we report that HBV leads to liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis through miR-30e targeting P4HA2. HBV transgenic mouse was treated by CCl4 to generate a model of liver fibrosis. A crucial enzyme catalyzing collagen formation, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit α2 (P4HA2) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blotting or quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. The function of HBV-modulated P4HA2 in hepatoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo was analyzed by EdU, MTT, colony-forming assay and animal transplantation assay. HBV transgenic mice exhibited more collagen deposition in liver after intraperitoneal injection of CCl4. P4HA2 was dramatically augmented in liver samples of HBV transgenic mice, clinical liver cirrhosis and liver cancer patients. Mechanistically, HBx was capable of inducing P4HA2 through suppressing miR-30e, in which miR-30e could target P4HA2 mRNA 3' untranslated region in liver cancer cells. HBx inhibited the miR-30e expression through increasing methylation of CpG islands in its promoter mediated by EZH2-formed complexes. Functionally, HBx-elevated P4HA2 enhanced the collagen deposition in the liver in vivo and in vitro, leading to liver fibrosis and liver cancer progression. In conclusion, HBx promotes the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma through miR-30e targeting P4HA2 mRNA. We provide novel perspective on how HBx induces liver fibrosis. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The human KRAS transcript contains a G-rich 5′-UTR sequence (77% GC) harboring several G4 motifs capable to form stable RNA G-quadruplex (RG4) structures that can serve as targets for small molecules. A biotin-streptavidin pull-down assay showed that 4,11-bis(2-aminoethylamino)anthra[2,3-b]furan-5,10-dione (2a) binds to RG4s in the KRAS transcript under low-abundance cellular conditions. Dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that 2a and its analogue 4,11-bis(2-aminoethylamino)anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-5,10-dione (2b) repress translation in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of the G4-ligands on Panc-1 cancer cells has also been examined. Both 2a and 2b efficiently penetrate the cells, suppressing protein p21KRAS to <10% of the control. The KRAS down-regulation induces apoptosis together with a dramatic reduction of cell growth and colony formation. In summary, we report a strategy to suppress the KRAS oncogene in pancreatic cancer cells by means of small molecules binding to RG4s in the 5′-UTR of mRNA. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Translationally controlled tumor protein(TCTP) has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, DNA repair and drug resistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying TCTP involved in cellular processes, we performed an affinity purification-based proteomic profiling to identify proteins interacting with TCTP in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. We found that a group of proteins involved in DNA repair are enriched in the potential TCTP interactome. Silencing TCTP by short hairpin RNA in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells leads to the declined repair efficiency for DNA double-strand breaks on the GFP-Pem1 reporter gene by homologous recombination, the persistent activation and the prolonged retention of γH2AX and Rad51 foci following ionizing radiation. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations indicated that TCTP forms complexes with Rad51 in vivo, and the stability maintenance of Rad51 requires TCTP in MCF-7 cells under normal cell culture conditions. Moreover, inactivation of TCTP by sertraline treatment enhances UVC irradiation-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, and causes sensitization to DNA-damaging drug etoposide and DNA repair inhibitor olaparib. Thus, we have identified an important role of TCTP in promoting DNA double-stand break repair via facilitating DNA homologous recombination processes and highlighted the great potential of TCTP as a drug target to enhance conventional chemotherapy for cancer patients with high levels of TCTP expression. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Peptides are a growing class of macromolecules used in pharmaceutics. The path toward the clinical use of candidate peptides involves sequence optimization and cyclization for stability and affinity. For internalized peptides, tagging is also often required for intracellular trafficking studies, although fluorophore conjugation has an impact on peptide binding, permeability, and localization. Herein, a strategy based on cysteine arylation with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (4F-2CN), which simultaneously cyclizes peptides and imparts fluorescence, is reported. The 4F-2CN cyclization of an M2 macrophage-targeting peptide yields, in a single step, a peptide with improved serum stability, intrinsic fluorescence, and increased binding affinity. In a murine breast cancer model, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic fluorescence from the cyclized peptide is sufficient for monitoring biodistribution by whole-organ fluorescence imaging and cell internalization by flow cytometry. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE To study expressions of Livin, a novel member of inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, in prostate carcinoma tissue and to investigate its correlation with PTEN expression. METHODS Livin and PTEN were determined by Western blot in 31 cases of prostate carcinoma tissue and 18 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue, which were collected in Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University between 2015-3-12 and 2016-10-15.Immunohistochemistry(SP method) was also applied to detect the expression of Livin and PTEN protein in prostate carcinoma and to study the correlation between the Livin and PTEN. The association between the expression levels of Livin, PTEN and the clinicopathological characteristics were studied. RESULTS The expressions of Livin protein were significantly higher in prostate carcinoma than those in the benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (2.16±0.83 vs 1.43±0.74, t=3.085, P=0.003). The expressions of PTEN protein were significantly lower in prostate carcinoma than those in the benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (1.33±0.88 vs 2.13±1.51, t=-2.351, P=0.023).The level of Livin and PTEN were close related to clinical stage and metastasis; but have no correlation with gender, tumor location, differentiation degree and PSA. The Livin protein was highly expressed in prostate carcinoma tissue.The PTEN protein was lower expressed in prostate carcinoma tissue. The expression of Livin had negative correlation with the expression of PTEN(OR=0.0392,P=0.0003). CONCLUSION The over expression of Livin and the low expression of PTEN in prostate carcinoma tissue are closed related to clinical stage and metastasis. The low expression of PTEN in prostate carcinoma tissue had negative correlation with the expression of Livin. The negative correlation between Livin and PTEN indicates that they are related to each other in carcinogenesis.The Livin and PTEN may play important roles in occurrence and development of prostate cancer. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Mutations in SETD2, encoding the histone 3 lysine 36 trimethyltransferase, are enriched in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MLL-rearranged acute leukemia. We investigated the impact of SETD2 mutations on chemotherapy sensitivity in isogenic leukemia cell lines and in murine leukemia generated from a conditional knockout of Setd2. SETD2 mutations led to resistance to DNA-damaging agents, cytarabine, 6-thioguanine, doxorubicin, and etoposide, but not to a non–DNA damaging agent, L-asparaginase. H3K36me3 localizes components of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and SETD2 mutation impaired DDR, blunting apoptosis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Consistent with local recruitment of DDR, genomic regions with higher H3K36me3 had a lower mutation rate, which was increased with SETD2 mutation. Heterozygous conditional inactivation of Setd2 in a murine model decreased the latency of MLL-AF9–induced leukemia and caused resistance to cytarabine treatment in vivo, whereas homozygous loss delayed leukemia formation. Treatment with JIB-04, an inhibitor of the H3K9/36me3 demethylase KDM4A, restored H3K36me3 levels and sensitivity to cytarabine. These findings establish SETD2 alteration as a mechanism of resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy, consistent with a local loss of DDR, and identify a potential therapeutic strategy to target SETD2-mutant leukemias. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To investigate the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on structural changes of gut microbiota in colorectal carcinogenesis. METHODS An azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- induced colitis mouse model was established. Fortytwo female FVB/N mice were randomly divided into the following three groups: group 1 (10 mice, negative control) was treated with vehicle, group 2 (16 mice, positive control) was treated with AOM plus vehicle, and group 3 (16 mice, EG) was treated with AOM plus EGCG. For aberrant crypt foci (ACF) evaluation, the colons were rapidly took out after sacrifice, rinsed with saline, opened longitudinally, laid flat on a polystyrene board, and fixed with 10% buffered formaldehyde solution before being stained with 0.2% methylene blue in saline. For tumor evaluation, the colon was macroscopically inspected and photographed, then the total number of tumors was enumerated and tumor size measured. For histological examination, the fixed tissues were paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 5 mm thickness. Microbial genomic DNA was extracted from fecal and intestinal content samples using a commercial kit. The V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA were PCR-Amplified with the barcoded fusion primers. Using the best hit classification option, the sequences from each sample were aligned to the RDP 16S rRNA training set to classify the taxonomic abundance in QIIME. Statistical analyses were then performed. RESULTS Treatment of mice with 1% EGCG caused a significant decrease in the mean number of ACF per mouse, when compared with the model mice treated with AOM/DSS (5.38 ± 4.24 vs 13.13 ± 3.02, P < 0.01). Compared with the positive control group, 1% EGCG treatment dependently decreased tumor load per mouse by 85% (33.96 ± 6.10 vs 2.96 ± 2.86, respectively, P < 0.01). All revealed that EGCG could inhibit colon carcinogenesis by decreasing the number of precancerous lesions as well as solid tumors, with reduced tumor load and delayed histological progression of CRC. During the cancerization, the diversity of gut microbiota increased, potential carcinogenic bacteria such as Bacteroides were enriched, and the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (Clostridiaceae , Ruminococcus , etc .) decreased continuously. In contrast, the structure of gut microbiota was relatively stable during the intervention of EGCG on colon carcinogenesis. Enrichment of probiotics (Bifidobacterium , Lactobacillu , etc .) might be a potential mechanism for EGCG's effects on tumor suppression. Via bioinformatics analysis, principal coordinate analysis and cluster analysis of the tumor formation process, we found that the diversity of gut microbiota increased in the tumor model group while that in the EGCG interfered group (EG) remained relatively stable. CONCLUSION Gut microbiota imbalance might be a potential mechanism for the prevention of malignant transformation by EGCG, which is significant for diagnosis, treatment, prognosis evaluation, and prevention of colorectal cancer. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Solid papillary carcinoma of breast is relatively uncommon. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features of SPC of the breast. METHODS A retrospective study was performed to analyze the the clinicopathological features of 12 cases of solid papillary carcinoma of the breast in Ningbo Woman and Children Hospital from 20 January 2012 to 20 January 2015, and a literature was conducted. RESULTS All cases were females, aged from 55 to 83 years, with mean age of 68.2 years. The presenting symptoms were either a palpable breast mass and nipple discharge or bloody discharge. Two patients accepted modified radical mastectomy, 9 patients accepted mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, and 11 patients had no findings of lymph nodes metastasis, only one accepted segmental mastectomy and did not undergo lymph node biopsy; general observation showed that tumors had substantive lesions, presented ashen or taupe colour, accompanied by cyst formation. Microscopically, tumor appeared swell and substantive lesions with fibrovascular network, nodule boundary clear, arranged closely, and no apparent papillary structures, formed false chrysanthemum-like-structure; the tumor cells were oval, polygonal, or spindled, the morphology as homogenous, the cells were lack of atypia. Mildly to moderately pleomorphic nuclei. Some of the cells were accompanied mucus secretion. Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumors all expressed ER, PR, the staining of HER-2 oncoprotein was negative, the proliferating index of Ki-67 was from 5% to 30%, average positive index was 10%, those almost were Luminal A type of breast cancer. p63 was negative (100%), CK5/6 was almost negative(91.6%), Calponin was almost negative (91.6%), CgA was positive (83.3%),Syn was positive (83.3%). Twelve patients received follow-up from 12 monthes to 48 monthes,none had tumor recurrence and metastasis.CONCLUSIONS SPC of breast, a rare pathologic type, that affects primarily elderly women, with distinctive histological morphology and immunophenotype, intracellular and ectracellular mucus and neuroendocrine, almost no lymph node metstasis, SPC has a good prognosis. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Tissue-resident memory CD8 + T (T RM) cells are found at common sites of pathogen exposure, where they elicit rapid and robust protective immune responses. However, the molecular signals that control T RM cell differentiation and homeostasis are not fully understood. Here we show that mouse T RM precursor cells represent a unique CD8 + T cell subset that is distinct from the precursors of circulating memory cell populations at the levels of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Using computational and pooled in vivo RNA interference screens, we identify the transcription factor Runx3 as a key regulator of T RM cell differentiation and homeostasis. Runx3 was required to establish T RM cell populations in diverse tissue environments, and supported the expression of crucial tissue-residency genes while suppressing genes associated with tissue egress and recirculation. Furthermore, we show that human and mouse tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes share a core tissue-residency gene-expression signature with T RM cells that is associated with Runx3 activity. In a mouse model of adoptive T cell therapy for melanoma, Runx3-deficient CD8 + tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes failed to accumulate in tumours, resulting in greater rates of tumour growth and mortality. Conversely, overexpression of Runx3 enhanced tumour-specific CD8 + T cell abundance, delayed tumour growth, and prolonged survival. In addition to establishing Runx3 as a central regulator of T RM cell differentiation, these results provide insight into the signals that promote T cell residency in non-lymphoid sites, which could be used to enhance vaccine efficacy or adoptive cell therapy treatments that target cancer. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

    "Abstract": "A semisynthetic strategy to obtain monophosphoryl lipid A derivatives equipped with clickable (azide, alkyne, double bond, or thiol precursor) moieties, starting from the native lipid A isolated from Escherichia coli, is presented. These lipid A derivatives can be conjugated with other interesting biomolecules, such as tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs). In this way, the immunostimulant activity of monophosphoryl lipid A can significantly improve the immunogenicity of TACAs, thus opening access to potential self-adjuvant anticancer vaccine candidates. A monophosphoryl lipid A-Thomson-Friedenreich (TF) antigen conjugate was obtained to demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology, which stands as a valuable, rapid, and scalable alternative to the highly complex approaches of total synthesis recently reported to the same aim. A preliminary evaluation of the immunological activity of this conjugate as well as of other semisynthetic lipid A derivatives was also reported. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",
