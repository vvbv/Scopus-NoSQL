    "Abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) has shown significant potential for anti-cancer modality. In this report, according to our best knowledge, we explore for the first time Ti 2 C-based MXene as a novel, highly efficient and selective agent for photothermal therapy (PTT). Ti 2 C superficially modified with PEG was obtained from the layered, commercially available Ti 2 AlC MAX phase in the process of etching aluminum layers using concentrated HF, and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA-XPS). The PEG-coated Ti 2 C flakes showed a satisfactory photothermal conversion efficacy (PTCE) and good biocompatibility in wide range of the tested concentrations. Through in vitro studies, the PEG-modified Ti 2 C demonstrated notable NIR-induced ability to cancerous cells’ ablation with minimal impact on non-malignant cells up to the concentration of 37.5 μg mL −1 . The applied doses of Ti 2 C_PEG in our work were even 24 times lower comparing other MXene-based photothermal agents. This work is expected to expand the utility of 2D MXenes to biomedical applications through the development of entirely novel agents for photothermal therapy.

    "Abstract": "Chemical pollution in marine ecosystems is leading towards an increase in the concentrations of heavy metals in fish body, which might have a negative impact on human health through consumption of fish. Here, five commercially important marine fishes (i.e. Sillaginopsis panijus, Trichiurus lepturus, Harpadon nehereus, Rita rita and Coilia dussumieri) were collected from the Kutubdia Channel of the northern Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. Samples were collected during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon for the year of 2016 to measure the heavy metal concentrations in edible part (flesh) of the fishes; and finally to assess the human health risk due to consumption of those fishes. Heavy metal concentrations (i.e. Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Sn and As) in the collected fish species were determined using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) method. Subsequently, for assessing the human health risk, the target hazard quotient (THQ) values were estimated. This study found that the heavy metal concentration for Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Sn and As in fish samples were 1.51 to 2.53, 2.14 to 5.08, 2.89 to 3.41, 14.54 to 18.45, 23.04 to 32.21 and &lt; 0.41 mg/kg respectively as dry weight basis. This study also revealed that the THQ values for all studied metals in five species of fishes for both seasons were &lt; 1, which indicating no cancer risk due to consumption of those fishes. On the other hand, the target cancer risk for Pb was found within an acceptable level (10 −4 to 10 -6 ). Therefore, it has been suggested that the selected tropical marine fishes might be free from contamination and human might be in safe from any risk due to consumption of those fishes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Gene transfection, as an effective treatment for inherited and acquired life threatening diseases caused by genetic deficiencies and abnormalities, has evolved as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer and other intractable diseases. Non-target-specific vectors will affect normal cells as well as pathogenic cells, resulting in a relative decrease in transfection efficiency and unnecessary cytotoxicity. In the present work, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with folate (FA)-modified polyethylenimine (PEI-FA) were prepared by a single step method (without additional reducing agent) for targeted gene transfection in tumor cells. Moreover, an improved compound vector system was developed by mixing PEI-AuNPs and PEI-FA-AuNPs. It was shown that the compound vector system not only greatly increased transfection efficiency in HeLa cells, but also reduced cytotoxicity. By comparison, the transfection efficiency in L929 cells lacking folate receptor, was clearly lower than in tumor cells. The specific gene transfection of HeLa cells using this vector system could be clearly observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy in a co-culture system of HeLa cells and L929 cells. This transfection system with high-efficiency, high-specificity and low-toxicity appears to have potential in targeted cancer treatment and drug delivery. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Atomic force microscope (AFM) is emerging as an immensely promising tool to study the cellular morphology with a nanometer scale resolution and to analyze nanomechanical properties (NPs) at various physiological conditions. Advancement of AFM technology enables studying living cells and differentiating cancer cell from normal cells based on topography and NPs. Though the trend overlaps from different literature; numerical values of nanomechanical readouts depict variations over a wide range. These anomalies are associated with the experimental setup under study. In this manuscript, we have identified heterogeneity in cell culture system in addition to the selection of AFM probe with specific tip geometry as the major contributors to the above mentioned anomalies. To test our hypothesis, we have used Panc1 cells, which is a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell type. Our results suggest that the cellular morphology, membrane roughness and NPs calculated from AFM study are distinctly influenced by cell cycle. Furthermore, we found that the NPs readout is also significantly associated with AFM tip geometries. The cells were found to be softer in their early resting phase when indented with pyramidal probe and became increasingly stiffer as they progressed through the cell cycles. On the contrary, when indented with the spherical probe, cells in G0/G1 phase were observed to be the stiffest. Such an exhaustive study of the role of cell cycle in influencing the NPs in Panc1 cell line along with the impact of tip geometry on NPs is the first of its kind, to the best of our knowledge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Assess the prevalence of neoplasia ≥6 mm at repeat CT colonoscopy (CTC) in individuals with no significant lesions at baseline. Methods: Individuals aged ≥18 years, with/without CRC risk factors, with no polyps ≥6 mm on baseline CTC (negative baseline) who underwent repeat CTC in a large HMO from 2001 to 2011 were retrospectively identified. Studies were reviewed by board-certified radiologists with experience interpreting CTC. Demographic details, CRC risk factors, and the number, size, and location of incident lesions were noted. Findings were classified using the C-RADS scale. Lesion prevalence at CTC-2 was determined, and study interval and risk characteristics of patients with- and without findings were compared. Results: Our study included 636 individuals (369 men [58.0%]; mean age 59.9 years) with negative baseline CTC who underwent repeat CTC after a mean 4.6 year interval (SD 1.6 years). At baseline, 469/636 (73.7%) were at average risk for CRC; 418 remained at average risk for CTC-2 with 51 (8.0%) developing new risk factors in the interval between studies. At CTC-2, 47 participants (7.4%) presented 52 significant neoplasia: 35 polyps 6–9 mm, 14 polyps ≥10 mm, and 3 masses in 3/636 participants (0.47%). 2/3 masses, 6/14 polyps ≥10 mm (42.9%), and 12/25 polyps 6–9 mm (48.0%) were in individuals with risk factors for CRC. Histopathology was available for 12/52 lesions (23.1%): 8 tubular adenomas, 2 villous adenomas, 1 hamartomatous polyp, 1 case of normal tissue. Conclusion: A mean 4.6 years after negative-baseline CTC, neoplasia ≥6 mm were seen in 7.4% of participants, including masses in 0.47%, supporting recommendations for a 5-year study interval. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Rhizoma Paridis, a traditional Chinese medicine, has shown promise in cancer prevention and therapy. Polyphyllin II is one of the most significant saponins in Rhizoma Paridis and it has toxic effects on kinds of cancer cells. However, our results in this study proved that the polyphyllin II has hepatotoxicity in vitro through caspases activation and cell-cycle arrest. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide results indicated polyphyllin II inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis in HepaRG cells and HL-7702 cells and showed a concentration and time-dependent. Then, we selected the innovative cell model-HepaRG cells to explore the mechanism of hepatotoxicity. Our data showed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased and the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased in HepaRG cells after administration of polyphyllin II. Besides, with the increase of concentration, the release of lactate dehydrogenase increased and the S phase of the cell cycle was arrested. Nevertheless, when pretreatment with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, apoptotic cells decreased significantly, inhibited the production of ROS and improved the decrease of membrane potential in HepaRG cells. Moreover, polyphyllin II treatment increased levels of Fas, Bax, cytochrome c, activated caspase-3, -8, -9, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and decreased Bcl-2 expression levels. Finally, we identified two signal pathways of apoptosis induced by polyphyllin II including the death receptor pathway and the mitochondria pathway. This study confirmed the hepatotoxicity of the polyphyllin II in vitro, which has never been discovered and gave a wake-up call for the clinical application of Rhizoma Paridis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To characterize daily geometrical variations of gastrointestinal organs with respect to pancreatic tumors, through a population-based statistical model. Materials and methods: The study included 131 CT scans from 35 pancreatic cancer patients treated with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT). For each patient, day-to-day anatomical variations of the stomach, the duodenum and the bowel were assessed from the deformation vector fields (DVF) obtained by non-rigidly registering the contours of the fractions to the planning CT scans. For the whole population, day-to-day motion-deformation patterns were abstracted using principal component analysis (PCA) on the set of DVFs mapped on a reference patient. Based on these geometrical variations, anatomies were generated to create population-based dose-volume histograms (DVH) per patient, which were also compared to clinical values. Results: Through PCA, the most dominant directions of daily deformations were localized in the abdominal organs. Common patterns were found, such as stomach contraction–expansion in the anterior–posterior direction ranging from 5 to 13 mm, and superior-inferior deformations on the bowel from 7 to 14 mm. The duodenum resulted to move laterally, but in a lesser extent (4–8 mm). The population-based DVHs derived from the model mostly included the daily DVHs observed in the clinic (in >90% of the cases). Conclusions: Anatomical variations influence the delivered doses to healthy organs during SBRT. A motion model was successfully built and explored to extract the larger directions of movement of the gastrointestinal organs. Day-to-day motion modeling can potentially be used to account for geometrical uncertainties in future plan optimization and in online adaptive strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway controls fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) regulates cytoplasmic MAPK signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) MAPK. To determine the role of DUSP6 in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, we characterized the intestinal epithelial phenotype of Dusp6 knockout (KO) mice under normal, oncogenic, and proinflammatory conditions. Our results show that loss of Dusp6 increased crypt depth and epithelial cell proliferation without altering colonic architecture. Crypt regeneration capacity was also enhanced, as revealed by ex vivo Dusp6 KO organoid cultures. Additionally, loss of Dusp6 induced goblet cell expansion without affecting enteroendocrine and absorptive cell differentiation. Our data also demonstrate that Dusp6 KO mice were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, as opposed to wild-type mice. In addition, Dusp6 gene deletion markedly enhanced tumor load in Apc Min/+ mice. Decreased DUSP6 expression by RNA interference in HT29 colorectal cancer cells enhanced ERK1/2 activation levels and promoted both anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as well as invasion through Matrigel. Finally, DUSP6 mRNA expression in human colorectal tumors was decreased in advanced stage tumors compared with paired normal tissues. These results demonstrate that DUSP6 phosphatase, by controlling ERK1/2 activation, regulates colonic inflammatory responses, and protects the intestinal epithelium against oncogenic stress. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Motivated by the potential anticancer activity of both coumarin and 2-aminothiazole nuclei, a new set of thiazol-2-yl hydrazono-chromen-2-one analogs were efficiently synthesized aiming to obtain novel hybrids with potential cytotoxic activity. MTT assay investigated the significant potency of all the target compounds against the human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa cells). Cell cycle analysis showed that the representative compound 8a led to cell cycle cessation at G0/G1 phase indicating that CDK2/E1complex could be the plausible biological target for these newly synthesized compounds. Thus, the most active compounds (7c and 8a-c) were tested for their CDK2 inhibitory activity. The biological results revealed their significant CDK2 inhibitory activity with IC 50 range of 0.022–1.629 nM. Moreover, RT-PCR gene expression assay showed that compound 8a increased the levels of the nuclear CDK2 regulators P21 and P27 by 2.30 and 5.7 folds, respectively. ELISA tequnique showed also that compound 8a led to remarkable activation of caspases-9 and -3 inducing cell apoptosis. QSAR study showed that the charge distribution and molecular hydrophobicity are the structural features affecting cytotoxic activity in this series. Molecular docking study for the most potent cytotoxic compounds (7c and 8a-c) rationalized their superior CDK2 inhibitory activity through their hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the key amino acids in the CDK2 binding site. Pharmacokinetic properties prediction of the most potent compounds showed that the newly synthesized compounds are not only with promising antitumor activity but also possess promising pharmacokinetic properties. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the effect of setup uncertainties including uncertainties between different breath holds (BH) and inter-fractional anatomical changes under CT-guided BH with intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in patients with liver cancer. Methods and materials: This retrospective study considered 17 patients with liver tumors who underwent feedback-guided BH (FGBH) IMRT treatment with daily CT-on-rail imaging. Planning CT images were acquired at simulation using FGBH, and FGBH CT-on-rail images were also acquired prior to each treatment. Selective robust IMPT plans were generated using planning CT and re-calculated on each daily CT-on-rail image. Subsequently, the fractional doses were deformed and accumulated onto the planning CT according to the deformable image registration between daily and planning CTs. The doses to the target and organs at risk (OARs) were compared between IMRT, planned IMPT, and accumulated IMPT doses. Results: For IMPT plans, the mean of D 98% of CTV for all 17 patients was slightly reduced from the planned dose of 68.90 ± 1.61 Gy to 66.48 ± 1.67 Gy for the accumulated dose. The target coverage could be further improved by adjusting planning techniques. The dose–volume histograms of both planned and accumulated IMPT doses showed better sparing of OARs than that of the IMRT. Conclusions: IMPT with FGBH and CT-on-rail guidance is a robust treatment approach for liver tumor cases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of image heterogeneity analysis of standard care magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) to predict chemoradiotherapy (CRT) outcome. The ability to predict disease recurrence following CRT has the potential to inform personalized radiotherapy approaches currently being explored in novel clinical trials. Methods: An IRB waiver was obtained for retrospective analysis of standard care MRIs from ASCC patients presenting between 2010 and 2014. Whole tumor 3D volume-of-interest (VOI) was outlined on T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of the pre- and post-treatment scans. Independent imaging features most predictive of disease recurrence were added to the baseline clinico-pathological model and the predictive value of respective extended models was calculated using net reclassification improvement (NRI) algorithm. Cross-validation analysis was carried out to determine percentage error reduction with inclusion of imaging features to the baseline model for both endpoints. Results: Forty patients who underwent 1.5 T pelvic MRI at baseline and following completion of CRT were included. A combination of two baseline MR heterogeneity features (baseline T2w energy and DWI coefficient of variation) was most predictive of disease recurrence resulting in significant NRI (p = 0 < 0.001). This was confirmed in cross-validation analysis with 34.8% percentage error reduction for the primary endpoint and 18.1% reduction for the secondary endpoint with addition of imaging variables to baseline model. Conclusion: MRI heterogeneity analysis offers complementary information, in addition to clinical staging, in predicting outcome of CRT in anal SCC, warranting validation in larger datasets. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Copy number variations (CNVs) contribute significantly to human genomic variability, some of which lead to diseases. However, effective detection of CNVs from whole genome next generation sequencing data (NGS) remains challenging. Here, we present BagGMM, a new method to call CNVs using tumor-normal matched samples from NGS data. BagGMM extracts read depth ratios of tumor samples to normal samples, divides the genomic sequences into segments by sliding windows to count the average coverage ratio of each segment, filters candidate deletions and duplications based on a coarse criterion of coverage ratio, and then builds Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for remaining ratios to identify the remaining ambiguous copy number states after filtration. Bagging multiple GMMs makes false positive calls descent instead of using one GMM, thus enhancing the detection power of BagGMM. Considering the computation speed of GMMs and false positive calls, we employ a segmentation procedure “large window and then small windows”, which is also helpful to determine boundary of CNV regions. We apply BagGMM to three simulation datasets and two groups of human whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for breast cancer patients and ovarian cancer patients to identify CNVs, respectively. All performed experiments demonstrate that BagGMM has the capability of robustly identification of CNVs with different sizes and states. The performance of this tool is compared to four peer existing CNV detection methods. BagGMM shows a significant improvement in both sensitivity and specificity for detecting both copy number gains and losses. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The inhibition of steroidogenic cytochrome P450 enzymes has been shown to play a central role in the management of life-threatening diseases such as cancer, and indeed potent inhibitors of CYP19 (aromatase) and CYP17 (17α hydroxylase/17,20 lyase) are currently used for the treatment of breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In the last few decades CYP11B1 (11-β-hydroxylase) and CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase), key enzymes in the biosynthesis of cortisol and aldosterone, respectively, have been also investigated as targets for the identification of new potent and selective agents for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, impaired wound healing and cardiovascular diseases. In an effort to improve activity and synthetic feasibility of our different series of xanthone-based CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 inhibitors, a small series of imidazolylmethylbenzophenone-based compounds, previously reported as CYP19 inhibitors, was also tested on these new targets, in order to explore the role of a more flexible scaffold for the inhibition of CYP11B1 and -B2 isoforms. Compound 3 proved to be very potent and selective towards CYP11B1, and was thus selected for further optimization via appropriate decoration of the scaffold, leading to new potent 4′-substituted derivatives. In this second series, 4 and 8, carrying a methoxy group and a phenyl ring, respectively, proved to be low-nanomolar inhibitors of CYP11B1, despite a slight decrease in selectivity against CYP11B2. Moreover, unlike the benzophenones of the first series, the 4′-substituted derivatives also proved to be selective for CYP11B enzymes, showing very weak inhibition of CYP19 and CYP17. Notably, the promising result of a preliminary scratch test performed on compound 8 confirmed the potential of this compound as a wound-healing promoter. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose/Objective(s): To investigate the patterns of nodal failure in patients enrolled in the international multicentre EMBRACE study. Materials/Methods: Nodal disease at diagnosis (N−, N+) and nodal failure were analysed per region (NF) (pelvic (parametrial, common iliac, internal/external iliac), inguinal and para-aortic (PAO)) in 1338 patients. Treatment consisted of chemo-radiation and MRI guided brachytherapy. PAO radiotherapy and/or nodal boost was left to the treating centre. At time of diagnosis 52% of patients had pathologic nodes. Frequency analyses were performed in relation to patient, primary tumour and nodal disease characteristics, and treatment related factors. Results: Median follow up was 34 months and 83% of NF occurred within 24 months. At diagnosis 99% of the N+ patients had pathologic nodes in the pelvis and 14% in the PAO. NF pelvic and NF PAO were reported in 55% and 68% of patients with NF, respectively. Overall NF was reported in 152 patients (11%); 7 and 16% for N- and N+ patients. Of the patients with NF, 41% were located outside the elective target (39% PAO), 40% inside and 35% inside the nodal boost target. Twelve percent of N+ patients that received a nodal boost had a NF inside the nodal boost target. Conclusion: Within the EMBRACE study cohort the overall number of patients developing nodal failure is low, significantly lower for N− compared to N+ patients. Pathological nodes at diagnosis are mainly located in the pelvis, whereas nodal failures are more often reported in the PAO region. About 40% of all nodal failures were reported outside the treatment targets. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Aim: This phase IB/II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the addition of cetuximab to standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC). Methods: Patients (pts) with resectable LAEC (T 2-3 N 0-1 M 0 , T 1-3 N 1 M 0 or T 1-3 N 0-1 M 1A) received an induction cycle of cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 , day 1, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1000 mg/m 2 /day, days 1–5, followed 4 weeks later by radiotherapy, 50.4 Gy, given with 2 cycles of cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 and escalating doses of 5-FU, days 1–4 and 29–32. Pts received 10 weekly infusions of cetuximab, 250 mg/m 2 , with a loading dose, 400 mg/m 2 . Surgery was planned 6–8 weeks after CRT. Results: 64 pts were treated and 60 completed CRT. Median age was 65 years and 66% were males. Adenocarcinoma/squamous ratio was 61%/39%. Tumors were advanced: 95% T 3 and 67% N 1 . Grade ≥3 toxicities occurred in 72%, with two (3%) toxic deaths. The 5-FU maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was 1000 mg/m 2 /day. Clinical complete response rate was 33%. Of the 55 operated pts, R0 resection was achieved in 51 (93%) and pathological complete response (pCR) in 18 (33%), with 8 (14%) postoperative deaths. The 5-year survival rate for all pts was 38%. Pts with squamous histology had higher pCR (55% vs 20%, p = 0.015), local control (96% vs. 74%, p &lt; 0.001) and 5-year survival (58% vs 25%, p = 0.011) rates. Conclusions: This study suggests that the addition of cetuximab to standard preoperative CRT is feasible. R0, pCR and local control rates are encouraging. Pts with squamous cell tumors benefited more from the addition of cetuximab. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of prebiotics (containing fructooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides, polydextrose, and resistant dextrin) intake on immune function and intestinal microbiota structure in perioperative patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: A randomized, double-blind, no-treatment parallel control clinical trial involving 140 perioperative patients (90 men and 50 women, aged 40–75 y) with CRC was performed. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: an intervention group (prebiotic group, n = 70) that received prebiotic supplementation of 30 g/d for 7 d, and a control group (non-prebiotic group, n = 70) that received no prebiotic supplementation. The nutritional and immunologic indices were evaluated for both groups before and after operation and analyzed against baseline values. Moreover, fecal samples were collected from 40 patients randomly chosen from the two groups to study intestinal microbiota, which was analyzed by sequencing the V3–V4 region of 16S ribosomal DNA using the Illumina (San Diego, CA) MiSeq (PE 2 × 300 bp) platform. Results: Oral intake of prebiotics produced significant effects on immunologic indices in both the preoperative and postoperative periods, but the patterns of effects were different. In the preoperative period, prebiotics increased serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG; P = 0.02), IgM (P = 0.00), and transferrin (P = 0.027; all P &lt; 0.05). In the postoperative period, enhanced levels of IgG (P = 0.003), IgA (P = 0.007), suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (CD3 + CD8 + ; P = 0.043), and total B lymphocytes (CD19 + ; P = 0.012) were identified in the prebiotic group (all P &lt; 0.05). The differences in the intestinal microbiota at the phylum level were not statistically significant between the intervention and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). At the genus level, prebiotics increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium (P = 0.017) and Enterococcus (P = 0.02; both P &lt; 0.05) but decreased the abundance of Bacteroides (P = 0.04) in the preoperative period (all P &lt; 0.05). In the postoperative period, the abundance of Bacteroides (P = 0.04) was decreased, but the abundance of Enterococcus (P = 0.00), Bacillus (P = 0.01), Lactococcus (P = 0.00), and Streptococcus (P = 0.037) increased in the non-prebiotic group (all P &lt; 0.05); however, no significant change was identified in the abundance of Enterococcus (P = 0.56), Lactococcus (P = 0.07), and Streptococcus (P = 0.56) as a result of prebiotic intervention in this period (all P &gt; 0.05). The abundance of Escherichia-Shigella was increased after prebiotic intake in the postoperative period (P = 0.014, P &lt; 0.05). There was a notable trend of decline in the abundance of intestinal microbiota from preoperative to postoperative in the non-prebiotic group. Conclusions: Prebiotic intake is recommended to improve serum immunologic indicators in patients with CRC 7 d before operation. Prebiotics improved the abundance of four commensal microbiota containing opportunistic pathogens in patients with CRC. Surgical stress decreased the abundance of most intestinal microbiota in the intestinal tract but increased the abundance of some opportunistic pathogens and commensal microbiota. Bacteroides is a relevant bacterial species for further research on the mechanism of prebiotics. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: A few observational studies have suggested that progesterone and dydrogesterone may have a lower risk of breast cancer than other progestogens. In our earlier xenograft animal experiments, progesterone did not stimulate breast tumors. The aim of this study was to test dydrogesterone for the first time. The study also evaluated the effects of PGRMC1 on proliferation with progestogens. Methods (1): In-vitro study. The proliferative effects of dydrogesterone and of progesterone were assessed in vitro using T47D cells transfected with PGRMC1 or empty vector in the presence or absence of estradiol. Additionally, to find the strongest proliferator for inclusion as a comparator in the xenograft animal study, norethisterone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol, and cyproterone acetate were tested. Methods (2): Xenograft main study. PGRMC1-transfected or empty-vector T47D and MCF7 xenotransplants were each treated with four different hormonal preparations: E2+placebo; E2+dydrogesterone; E2+progesterone; E2+norethisterone. A total of 112 castrated mice were randomly allocated to the 16 groups. This was thus a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled four-arm study (45–50 days) with the two T47D and two MCF7 xenografts. Tumor volumes were monitored twice weekly. Results (1): In-vitro study. The strongest proliferation was with norethisterone, but only with PGRMC1-transfected cells. There was significant proliferation with dydrogesterone, but not with progesterone in the absence of estradiol. However, no increase in proliferation was achieved by adding dydrogesterone to estradiol compared with the proliferation induced with estradiol alone, in contrast to norethisterone. Results (2): Xenograft main study. There was significantly faster tumor growth with norethisterone + E2 than with E2+placebo in T47D and MCF7 PGRMC1 xenografts, but not with dydrogesterone + E2 or progesterone + E2. There was less tumor growth in empty-vector xenografts, without between-group differences. Conclusion: PGRMC1 increases the breast-cell proliferation effects of certain progestogens, including dydrogesterone, in contrast to progesterone, but not during estradiol-induced proliferation, either in vitro or in a xenograft animal model, in contrast to norethisterone. Thus the proliferative potency of dydrogesterone may be similar to that of progesterone. Clinical studies in women overexpressing PGRMC1 are recommended. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "An algorithm for tumor delineation in positron emission tomography (PET) is presented. Segmentation is achieved by a local active contour algorithm, integrated and optimized with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method, which takes advantage of the stratified k-fold cross-validation strategy. The proposed approach is evaluated considering the delineation of cancers located in different body districts (i.e. brain, head and neck, and lung), and considering different PET radioactive tracers. Data are pre-processed in order to be expressed in terms of standardized uptake value, the most widely used PET quantification index. The algorithm uses an initial, operator selected region containing the lesion, and automatically identifies an operator-independent optimal region of interest around the tumor. Successively, a slice-by-slice marching local active contour segmentation algorithm is used. The key novelty of the proposed approach consists of a novel form of the energy to be minimized during segmentation, which is enhanced by incorporating the information provided by a KNN classifier. The delineation process and its termination are fully automatic, so that intervention from the user is reduced to a minimum. Due to the high level of automation, the final segmented lesion is independent of inter-operator variation in the initial user input, making the entire process robust and the result completely repeatable. In order to assess the performance under different contrast ratio scenarios, we first evaluate the proposed method on five phantom datasets. Next, we assess the applicability of the method in the radiotherapy environment by investigating fifty clinical cases and two different PET radio-tracers. Our investigation shows that the proposed method can be applied in clinical settings and produces accurate and operator-independent segmentations, attaining good accuracy in realistic conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), but little is known about the function of lncRNAs in the colorectal liver metastasis (CLM). This study was designed to identify specific lncRNAs correlating to liver metastasis of CRC, and to further assess their clinical value. Seventeen patients with primary CRC lesions, adjacent normal mucosa, and synchronous liver metastases lesions were divided into discovery set (six patients) and test set (11 patients). Transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) was used to screen differential expression of lncRNAs in the discovery set. Based on bioinformatics data, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the target lncRNA in test set. The relationships between target lncRNA and clinical values were analysed in an expanded validation set of additional 91 patients. 23 upregulated and 14 downregulated lncRNAs were detected for distinguishing synchronous liver metastases, primary CRC lesions from adjacent normal mucosa in the RNAseq set. The expression levels of four lncRNAs in the 37 lncRNA signature were verified by qRT-PCR in the test set. Compared with the paired normal mucosa, high expression levels of lnc-small-nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) were detected not only in primary CRC lesions but also in liver metastases lesions in the test set. Furthermore, in the expanded validation set, high expression of lnc-SNHG15 was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis and liver metastasis (p < 0.05), and patients displaying high lncRNA-SNHG15 expression exhibited a shorter median overall survival duration than those displaying low expression (30.7 vs. 35.2 months; p = 0.003). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that lncRNA-SNHG15 overexpression may serve as a poor prognostic biomarker for CRC patients (p = 0.049; Cox's regression: 2.731). Lnc-SNHG15 overexpression was significantly associated with CLM and high-expression of lnc-SNHG15 in CRC was an independent predictor of poor survival. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Despite existing evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has a favorable prognosis compared to HPV-negative OPSCC, randomized studies have yet to report the effect of de-escalating radiation therapy (RT) dose for definitive treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of dose de-escalated RT (DDRT) vs. standard dose RT (SDRT) in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. Methods: This was an observational study using the National Cancer Database (Year 2010–2014) to identify patients who had HPV-positive OPSCC and were treated with definitive RT or chemo-RT. Patients undergoing surgery were excluded. Patients receiving ≥50 Gy, but <66 Gy were categorized as receiving DDRT. Patients receiving ≥66 Gy were categorized as receiving SDRT. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity scores was used to balance the two groups. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to estimate overall survival (OS). Subset analyses in patients receiving RT alone and concurrent chemo-RT were also performed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate factors associated with OS. Results: 759 patients with HPV-positive OPSCC were identified: 104 received DDRT and 655 received SDRT. The median follow-up was 30.5 (2.4–81.4) months. After IPTW-adjusted analysis, there was no difference in the 3-yr OS between the two groups (82.2% vs. 79.3%; P = 0.85). In the subset of patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, IPTW-adjusted analysis also did not show a difference in the 3-yr OS between the two groups (83.1% vs. 79.6%; P = 0.83). On multivariable analysis, DDRT was not associated with an inferior OS (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53–1.47; P = 0.63). Conclusions: In this study, DDRT was not associated with an inferior OS compared to SDRT in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. Randomized clinical trials to address DDRT in this patient population are currently ongoing. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "A series of novel 7-hydroxycoumarin-3-carboxamides was synthesized by the reaction of 7-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxylic acid with various substituted aromatic amines. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against the four physiologically relevant human carbonic anhydrase (hCA, EC 4.2.1.1) isoforms CA I, CA II, CA IX and CA XII. The CA inhibition results show that the newly synthesized 7-hydroxycoumarin-3-carboxamides (4a-n) exhibited selective inhibition of the tumor associated isoforms, CA IX and CA XII over CA I and II isoforms. The inhibition constants ranged from sub micromolar to low micromolar. Amongst all the compounds tested, compound 4m was the most effective inhibitor exhibiting sub micromolar potency against both hCA IX and hCA XII, with a K i of 0.2 µM. Therefore, it can be anticipated that compound 4m can serve as a lead for development of anticancer therapy by exhibiting a novel mechanism of action.

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regarded as promising biomarkers for the prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of different cancers. However, resulting from their low abundance, short length and high sequence similarity among family members, it is of major challenge to detect these miRNAs. On the basis of a mismatched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) amplification and ratiometric strategy, we constructed an electrochemical sensor for sensitively detecting miRNAs from tumor cells. The target miRNA can cyclically trigger the assembly of two hairpins with mismatched bases into many duplexes via CHA. Subsequently, these duplexes further associate with another hairpin assembled on the sensor surface to generate stable “Y”-shaped DNA complexes, which causes reverse current change for two electrochemical labels on the hairpins. It is found that the introduction of the mismatched bases in the hairpins for CHA can reduce the background noise to improve the signal to background ratio of the sensor, leading to a dynamic range of 5 fM–0.1 nM and a low detection limit of 1.1 fM for miRNA detection. Besides, the developed sensor can be employed to monitor and evaluate the expression levels of miRNAs in different tumor cells, demonstrating its potential real applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Nanodrug carrier-based cancer therapy has been actively developed in the past decades. The main challenges faced by nanodrug carriers include poor drug loading capacity, rapid clearance from blood circulation, and low antitumor efficiency. In this work, a new type of antineoplastic agents, F-RGID, were developed using a two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO) with an incorporated photosensitizer (Indocyanine Green, ICG) and a chemotherapeutic drug (Doxorubicin, DOX) as the internally wrapped nanoparticles, and the RBC membrane (RM) inserted with the targeting molecule (folic acid, F) as a shell. The endogenous nature of RM confers F-RGID excellent biocompatibility and the ability to evade from clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). In addition, F-RGID is decorated with folic acid for selective recognition of tumor cells via a lipid-insertion approach. Another salient feature of the antineoplastic platform is the combination of photothermal-chemotherapy with ICG and DOX. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that F-RGID could provide a bionic nanoplatform for tumor-targeted photothermal-chemotherapy in clinic. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The technology of ink-jet printing has been an appealing alternative to traditional photolithography for fabricating flexible and elastic circuits, having low-cost and ease of control. In this work, a novel, unique and sensitive immunoassay designed based on application of silver nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (Ag/RGO) ink for fabrication of paper based immunosensor, Cysteamine coped gold nanoparticles (CysA/Au NPs) as a signal amplification element for determination of CA15-3 protein. Fully electrochemically methodology was applied to prepare a new transducer based on the Ag/RGO surface which provides high surface area for CA15-3 antibody immobilization in high amount. Under optimized experimental conditions, the Ag-RGO/CysA-Au NPs based immunosensor shows good specificity and sensitivity. The obtained LLOQ of immunosensor for CA 15-3 biomarker was 15 U/mL as well as calibration curve was linear in the range of 15–125 U/mL. The technique was successfully employed assay of CA15-3 biomarker in unprocessed human plasma samples. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In order to investigate potential therapeutically agents, novel products of Biginelli reaction (4a-l) were synthesized and exposed to cytotoxic and caspase activities, angiogenesis, cell cycle distribution, gene and microRNA expression levels, lipophilicity assessment and docking study. Among the twelve novel compounds (4a-l) evaluated for the cytotoxic activity, five of them (4c, 4d, 4f, 4k and 4l) that showed excellent activity on the tested cell lines (HeLa, LS174 and A549) were selected for further evaluation. Interestingly, compound 4f has up to three times higher selectivity index (SI) towards cancer cells than cisplatin (on HeLa, LS174 and A549 SI = 18.2, 13.5 and 11.2, respectively). The obtained results from cell cycle distribution and caspase activity indicate that tested compounds (4c, 4d, 4f, 4k and 4l) promoted caspase-9 activation, implicated in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Lipophilicity of 4a-l was determinate by using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Different series of novel pyrazole and pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidine derivatives (2a-g), (3a-c), (7a-d) and (10a-e) were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit CDK2/cyclin A2 enzyme in vitro. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the newly synthesized compounds was screened against four different human cancer cell lines. The CDK2/cyclin A2 enzyme inhibitory activity revealed that compounds (2d) and (2 g) are among the most active with inhibitory activity values of 60% and 40%, respectively, while compounds (7d) and (10b) exhibited the highest activity among the newly synthesized derivatives against four tumor cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7, A549 and Caco2) with IC50 values 24.24, 14.12, 30.03 and 29.27 μM and 17.12, 10.05, 29.95 and 25.24 μM, respectively. Flow cytometry cell cycle assay was carried for compounds (7d) and (10b) to investigate their apoptotic activity. The obtained results revealed that they induced cell-cycle arrest in the G0-G1phase and reinforced apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Molecular modeling studies have been carried out to gain further understanding the binding mode of the target compounds together with field alignment to define the similar field properties. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A methyl methacrylate (MMA) modified chitosan (CS) conjugate (CSMMA) has been synthesized by a green method via Michael addition reaction between CS and MMA in ethanol. The synthesized conjugate was characterized by FT-IR, 1 H NMR, X-ray diffraction spectrometry and SEM analysis. The results confirmed that CS was covalently linked to MMA yielding a highly porous framework. The uses of CSMMA were analyzed as a potential gene and drug delivery agent. CSMMA proved to be a reasonably good gene delivery agent based on transfection efficiency studies in mammalian cancer cell lines (A549, HeLa and HepG2). For drug delivery studies, nanoparticles of the CSMMA biopolymer were prepared by ionic gelation method with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP). The prepared nanoparticles were characterized in terms of FE-SEM, DLS and zeta potential. In vitro drug release study of curcumin loaded CSMMA nanoparticles showed its maximal entrapment efficiency up to 68% and the drug release was more rapid at a pH (5.0) lower than physiological pH. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The increasing use of dendrimers shows promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, Chagas disease and other conditions such as cancer. In this study, the activity of 1st and 2nd generation dendrimers over T. cruzi in the epimastigote stage was tested. Dendrimers were derived from α-ethynylestradiol (EE) modified with PAMAM-type dendrons through a triazole ring. The activity of each compound was evaluated in five doses (from 1.3 to 20 µmol/mL) by flow cytometry, including benznidazole (Bz) as positive control. The findings show that an equivalent concentration of 14.8 µmol/mL of 2nd generation (G) dendrimer is 8 times more effective than Bz at 24 h, and it maintains its superiority at 48 h with an IC 50 = 1.25 ± 0.19 µmol/mL. A TUNEL assay showed that dendrimers induce cell death in T. cruzi epimastigotes mostly via apoptosis, unlike Bz, which induces death via necrosis in more than 50% of cells. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate diagnostic tests, analysts use meta-analyses to provide inputs to parameters in decision models. Choosing parameter estimands from meta-analyses requires understanding the meta-analytic and decision-making contexts. Study Design and Setting: We expand on an analysis comparing positron emission tomography (PET), PET with computed tomography (PET/CT), and conventional workup (CW) in women with suspected recurrent breast cancer. We discuss Bayesian meta-analytic summaries (posterior mean over a set of existing studies, posterior estimate in an existing study, posterior predictive mean in a new study) used to estimate diagnostic test parameters (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity) needed to calculate quality-adjusted life years in a decision model contextualizing PET, PET/CT, and CW. Results: The mean and predictive mean give similar estimates, but the latter displays greater uncertainty. Namely, PET/CT outperforms CW on average but may not do better than CW when implemented in future settings. Conclusion: Selecting estimands for decision model parameters from meta-analyses requires understanding the relationship between decision settings and meta-analysis studies' settings, specifically whether the former resemble one or all study settings or represents new settings. We provide an algorithm recommending appropriate estimands as input parameters in decision models for diagnostic tests to obtain output parameters consistent with the decision context. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Herein, we report a facile one-step synthetic strategy for fabrication of three (blue, green and yellow) fluorescent color carbon dots (CDs) from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The as-synthesized CDs showed emission peaks at 450, 520 and 560 nm for blue, green and yellow color CDs when excited at 370, 420 and 460 nm, respectively. Using tomato as a carbon source, the fabricated three fluorescent color CDs showed good water dispersity and high quantum yield. The analytical performances of three fluorescent color CDs are evaluated by detecting Fe 3+ ion in biofluids and iron tablets. Upon the addition of Fe 3+ ion under optimal conditions, the fluorescence intensity of three fluorescent color CDs was quenched linearly over the range of 0.1 to 2.0 μM. This method opens a new analytical strategy to quantify Fe 3+ ion in iron tablets and biofluids with high sensitivity. Further, the uptake of three fluorescent color CDs into HeLa cells was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Intracellular experiments demonstrated that the three fluorescent color CDs were effectively internalized the cells and show excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity, suggesting that the CDs can be used as good candidates for biomedical applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Reprogramming of ‘adult’ differentiated somatic cells to ‘embryonic’ pluripotent stem cells accompanied by increased rate of glycolysis. Conversely, glycolysis triggers accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a potential causative factor in aging, by promoting methylglyoxal production. Therefore, it is reasonable that pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) would specifically regulate glycolysis to maintain their embryonic features. In this study, we focused on glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), a key enzyme in the glycine cleavage system that regulates glycolysis and methylglyoxal production in cancer. GLDC was exclusively expressed in PSCs, and inhibition of this enzyme induced alterations of metabolome and AGE accumulation, thereby suppressing the embryonic pluripotent state. Surprisingly, the level of accumulated AGEs in somatic cells gradually decreased during reprogramming, ultimately disappearing in iPSCs. In addition, ectopic expression of GLDC or treatment with the AGE inhibitor LR-90 promoted reprogramming. Together, these findings suggest that GLDC-mediated regulation of glycolysis and controlling AGE accumulation is related to maintenance and induction of pluripotency. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Dibrefeldins A and B (1 and 2), two unexpected brefeldin A (BFA) dimers, as well as brefeldin F (3), brefeldin G (4), and 14-hydroxy-BFA (5), three new BFA derivatives, together with three new naturally occurring BFA derivatives (6–8) and four known analogues (9–12), were isolated from the fungus Penicillium janthinellum. Dibrefeldins A and B (1 and 2) represent the first examples of BFA dimers formed by an esterification between two BFA monomer units. Brefeldin F (3) has an α,β-unsaturated γ-lactone ring, and this moiety was first discovered in naturally occurring BFA derivatives. The structures and relative/absolute configurations of these derivatives were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods, 13 C NMR calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compounds 1, 2, 8, and 9 showed excellent cytotoxic activities against six cancer cell lines with IC 50 values ranging from 0.01 to 4.45 μM. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying HCC progression and metastasis are still in obscure. Here, we used bioinformatic analysis to identify miRNAs that regulate GP73, a specific marker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. The correlations between miR-141-3p and clinic-pathological factors were analyzed in HCC patient samples; proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation were studied using established HCC cell lines. Expression levels of target genes (miR-141-3p, GP73, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, occludin, vimentin, and cytokeratin 18) were detected by either Western blot or qRT-PCR analysis. Xenograft models were established to evaluate tumor growth and metastasis. MiR-141-3p was significantly reduced in HCC tumors and cell lines, highly correlated with tumor progression. In contrast, GP73 was negatively correlated with miR-141-3p in HCC tumors. MiR-141-3p overexpression significantly decreased HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). GP73 overexpression partially restored the inhibitory effects of miR-141-3p, while miR-141-3p overexpression markedly inhibited tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, which were partially reversed by GP73 overexpression. Our findings suggest that miR-141-3p targets GP73 to reverse EMT, subsequently inhibiting HCC progression and metastasis. Thus, overexpression of miR-141-3p could serve as a therapeutic strategy to arrest HCC. © 2019",

Flt3-specific inhibitors have shown promising results in interfering with AML prompting us to model this interesting target. We implemented ligand-based, QSAR-guided, pharmacophore exploration combined with novel structure-based computational workflow based on docking-based comparative intermolecular contacts analysis (db-CICA) combined with homology modelling to explore the pharmacophoric features of 93 diverse cyclic Flt3 inhibitors. The resulting pharmacophore models were used as virtual search queries to scan the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database for novel Flt3 inhibitory leads. Ten hits of novel scaffolds were captured showing anti-Flt3 IC 50 values ranging from 1.2 to 14.7 μM. Interestingly, six of them illustrated low micromolar and submicromolar potencies against the mutated active form of Flt3 (Flt3D835Y) and the related vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Recent evidence has highlighted that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are associated with many diseases, particularly cancer. However, current understanding of the lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains limited. Our studies indicated that the DLEU1 expression level was upregulated in PDAC tissue samples compared with adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, the aberrant overexpression of DLEU1 indicated poor prognosis of patients with PDAC. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that DLEU1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PDAC cells in vitro and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-381 potentially targeted the DLEU1 3′-untranslated region (UTR), suggesting an interaction between miR-381 and DLEU1. Furthermore, miR-381 also targeted the chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) messenger RNA 3′-UTR, which was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, our study demonstrated the oncogenic role of DLEU1 in clinical PDAC specimens and cellular experiments, showing the potential involvement of DLEU1/miR-381/CXCR4 pathway. These results provide novel insight into PDAC tumorigenesis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Intraoperative electron radiation therapy is one of the cancer treatment techniques that delivers high doses to the tumor bed by dedicated mobile accelerators such as LIAC. Two types of applicators (standard cylindrical applicators and beam shaper applicator) can be used with LIAC. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the physical and dosimetric characteristics of emerging electrons from distal end of mentioned applicators. For this purpose, percentage depth dose, dose profiles and output factors were measured and compared. Furthermore, energy and angular distribution of electron beam at the exit of both applicator types were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. A considerable difference was observed in both physical and dosimetric characteristics of emerging electrons from distal end of applicators under investigation which is mainly due to the presence of shielding blades in design of beam shaper applicator. This difference in both dosimetric and physical properties, can change the considered treatment planning procedure for patient irradiation during the employment of each studied applicator type. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Quinoline-derivative coordination compounds were synthesized with Zn(II), Al(III), Cu(II), Ru(II) producing 1–4 compounds using 5-nitro-8-hydroxyquinoline and 5–8 compounds using 5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline. These coordination compounds were characterized by elemental analysis and 1 H NMR, IR, UV–Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, representing the coherent data matched all compounds. Myelotoxicity data, as well as the biochemical data, depicted the compounds have low cytotoxicity towards the blood cells. All coordination compounds displayed slight antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis; [RuCl(NO)(5-chloro-8-oxyquinoline) 2 ] compound (8) represent the best result to inhibitions of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Antineoplasic action depicted the [Ru(NO)(5-nitro-8-oxyquinoline) 2 Cl] compound (4) as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against MCF-7 (a breast cancer cell line), compared to cisplatin (Platistine® CS) and cyclophosphamide (Genuxal®) drugs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Liver diseases are serious life-threating conditions that should be controlled. Here, we identify a protein fraction from royal-jelly (RJ) that represents the most effective composite against CCl 4 -induced hepatotoxicity and HepG2 cell growth. Two closely related proteins were purified from this fraction by a new simple method and identified by MALDI-TOF MS as major RJ protein 2 (MRJP2) and its predicted isoform X1. The in silico assessment (3D structures and functions) of these proteins were performed using Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER) analysis and RAMPAGE program. These two purified proteins were able to relieve the necrotic hepatocytes (by 60.4%) via reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and intracellular reactive species. The latter effects associated with improving hepatocyte functions. Furthermore, they revealed the potent anticancer effect via induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and controlling the expression of both Bcl-2 and p53 in HepG2 cells. Thus, MRJP2 and its isoform X1 can be a promising dual strategy for fighting hepatic injury and cancer in future animal and human studies. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The present study demonstrated the development of gemcitabine and betulinic acid co-encapsulated PLGA−PEG polymer nanoparticles for enhancing the chemotherapeutic response. This combinatorial PLGA-PEG nanoparticle was formulated using double emulsion and had size <200 nm. The developed nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy for their size and shape, respectively. The in vitro release of the drugs from combinatorial nanoparticles was predominantly followed by Fickian diffusion phenomenon. Study on hemocompatibilty approved the administration of this combinatorial nanoparticle for animal study. In vitro cytotoxicity study on Panc1 cells using MTT assay, reactive oxygen species production and cellular apoptotic assay demonstrated that combinatorial nanoparticle was more cytotoxic compared to native drugs solution. Furthermore, the combinatorial nanoparticle suppressed tumor growth more efficiently in Ehrlich (solid) tumor model than the native gemcitabine and betulinic acid at the same concentrations. These findings indicated that PLGA-PEG nanoparticle might be used to co-deliver multiple chemotherapeutic drugs with different properties for enhancing antitumor efficacy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Iron is an essential element of the human body, and redox cycling between ferric iron (Fe(III)) and ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is closely related to the occurrence of the disease. Herein, we described a novel stable Au-nanocomposites fluorescence nanosensor that was designed by cross-linking polymerization of histamine and BSA-gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with glutaraldehyde. After reacting with the Fe(III), the Au NPs were released from the Au-nanocomposites through synergy between chelating effect of histamine and Fe(III) catalytic hydrolysis of schiff base reaction. Fluorescence enhancement of the nanosensor for Fe(III), which achieved high sensitivity detection of Fe(III) and the detection limit was 18.7 pM. The nanosensor was able to differentiate normal cells (hepatocytes LX-2) with cancer cells (HepG2) by fluorescence imaging of Fe(III) levels in cells. Finally, the nanosensor was successfully applied for fluorescence imaging of Fe(III) levels in labile iron pools of ferroptosis. This study not only provides a sensitive imaging method for Fe(III) in cells, but also provides a new strategy for study of Fe(III)-related cellular function regulation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Regio and stereoselective activation of sp 3 C–H bonds remain one of the major advantages of biocatalysis over traditional chemocatalytic methods. Herein, we describe the oxy-functionalization of halimane diterpenoid 1 by whole cells of three filamentous fungi, aiming to obtain derivatives with desirable biological properties. After incubating 1 with Fusarium oxysporum, Myrothecium verrucaria, and Rhinocladiella similis at different concentrations and incubation times, four known (3, 5, 6, and 7) and three new (2, 4, and 8) halimane derivatives were obtained and characterized. F. oxysporum catalyzed the hydroxylation of positions C-2 (2) and C-7 (4), while R. similis simultaneously mediated the 2-oxo-functionalization and the hydration of 13,14-(C–C)double bond belonging to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system (8). Compounds 1–7 were non-cytotoxic against HCT-116 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines at tested concentrations. However, substrate 1 displayed moderate reduction ability against biofilm produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC35984 (84% at 1.6 mM), and this effect was retained to some extent by derivatives 4 and 7. These results emphasize the prominent potential of filamentous fungi associated with the microbiota of medicinal plants as versatile catalysts for singularly useful reactions through their complex enzymatic machinery, as well as the high susceptibility of halimane-diterpenoid substrates. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely aggressive malignancy with very limited treatment options. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising cytotoxic agents capable of highly selective delivery. Aspartate-β-hydroxylase (ASPH) is a type II transmembrane protein highly expressed in PDACs (97.1%) but not normal pancreas. We investigated anti-tumor effects of an ADC guided by a human monoclonal antibody (SNS-622) against ASPH in human PDAC cell lines and derived subcutaneous (s.c.) xenograft as well as a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) murine model with spontaneous pulmonary metastasis. The cytotoxic effects exhibited by several candidate payloads linked to SNS-622 antibody targeting ASPH + PDACs were analyzed. After i.v. administration of SNS-622-emtansine (DM1) ADC, the primary PDAC tumor growth and progression (number and size of pulmonary metastases) were determined. The PDAC cell lines, s.c. and PDX tumors treated with ADC were tested for cell proliferation, cytotoxicity and apoptosis by MTS and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. SNS-622-DM1 construct has demonstrated optimal anti-tumor effects in vitro. In the PDX model of human PDAC, SNS-622-DM1 ADC exerted substantially inhibitory effects on tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis through attenuating proliferation and promoting apoptosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Endocrine disruptive compounds are widely used and well-known chemicals that could alter some vital processes taking place in living organisms. These chemicals might cause serious health disorders such as different types of cancer, sexual anorexia and mood disorders. In this study, combination of stearic acid coated magnetic nanoparticles based dispersive solid-phase extraction method (DSPE) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) instrumentation was used for the extraction/preconcentration of 4-tert-octylphenol, chlorpyrifos-ethyl and penconazole from aqueous samples. All the extraction parameters such as the amount of nanoparticles, duration of the interaction, the type and the amount of the eluent were optimized. As a result of optimization studies, limit of detection values were found to be 0.41 μg/L for 4-tert-octylphenol, 0.33 μg/L for penconazole and 9.77 μg/L for chlorpyrifos-ethyl. In order to investigate the accuracy and the applicability of the developed method in different matrices, recovery studies were performed in tap and wastewater samples. The results showed that the method is accurate and sensitive for the analytes of interest and applicable in different matrices with high recovery results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Increasing evidence has demonstrated that abnormal expression of lncRNA is correlated with various malignant tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our current study was aimed to investigate the role of LINC00707 in HCC development. We observed that LINC00707 was upregulated in HCC cell lines compared with normal liver cell lines. Then, Hep3B cells and SNU449 cells were infected with LV-shLINC00707 and LV-LINC00707. LINC00707 silencing could greatly repress the proliferation and colony formation of HCC cells in vitro. On the contrary, overexpression of LINC00707 induced HCC cell proliferation and colony formation. In addition, HCC cell apoptosis was significantly enhanced and HCC cell cycle was blocked in G1 phase by LV-shLINC00707. Hep3B cells and SNU449 cell invasion capacity was restrained by the knockdown of LINC00707, whereas upregulation of LINC00707 exhibited an opposite phenomenon. Accumulating evidence has reported that ERK/JNK/AKT signaling is involved in multiple cancers, including HCC. Here, in our study, we identified that ERK/JNK/AKT signaling was dramatically restrained by silencing of LINC00707 while activated by LV-LINC00707 in HCC cells. Subsequently, an in vivo experiment was conducted, and it demonstrated that LINC00707 could modulate HCC development through activating ERK/JNK/AKT signaling. Taking the above results together, it was implied in our study that LINC00707 contributed to HCC progression through modulating the ERK/JNK/AKT pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "4-Amino-N-adamantylphthalimide (1) is a dye with moderate absorptivity (in CH 3 CN ε 363 = 4200 M −1 cm −1 ) and high quantum yield of fluorescence (Φ F = 0.15–0.80) that exhibits fluorosolvatochromic properties. The dye can be excited at 405 nm and the position of fluorescence maximum and the Stokes shift are well correlated with the E T (30) parameter. The excitation in the near-visible part of the spectrum and low cytotoxicity allow use of the dye in live cell microscopy. Due to its amphiphilic character, the dye stains artificial membranes in liposomes. Using confocal microscopy on two human cancer cell lines, we have shown that 1 stains primarily intracellular lipid droplets. Colocalization experiments with different organelle markers indicated that 1 additionally stains mitochondrial membranes. The fluorosolvatochromism of 1 allows the simultaneous visualization of mitochondria and intracellular lipid droplets in two separate emission channels, which has a potential use in cells and tissues exhibiting intense oxidative metabolism of lipids. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A new ergosterol derivative, 23R-hydroxy-(20Z,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),20(22)-tetraen-3-one (1), and a biosynthetically related known compound, (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (2), were isolated from the co-culture between endophytic fungus Pleosporales sp. F46 and endophytic bacterium Bacillus wiedmannii Com1 both inhibiting in the medicinal plant Mahonia fortunei. The structure of the new compound 1 was determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis using HRMS and NMR, together with the modified Mosher's ester method. This is the first example of isolation of a ergosterol derivative with a Δ 20(22) -double bond in the side chain. Compound 1 exhibited moderate antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and no obvious cytotoxic activities against the cancer cell lines A549, MDA-MB-231 and Hct116. Our results not only reveal that compound 1 is a potent antibacterial lead compound, but also highlight the powder of co-cultivation for inducing the production of cryptic natural products from endophytes derived from the same host plant. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "MXenes as a new class of 2D materials have recently been widely applied in energy storage, electrocatalysis, sensors, adsorption, water purification, and so on, due to their tunable versatile properties. Herein, we demonstrate a simple, rapid and highly-sensitive sensing platform based on ultrathin two-dimensional MXene Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets (Ti 3 C 2 NSs) for selective analysis of Human papillomavirus (HPV), a major human pathogens and causative agents of cervical cancer. Ultrathin Ti 3 C 2 NSs, obtained by exfoliating their layered HF-etched powder, exhibit high fluorescence quenching ability to dye-labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and different affinities for ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Under the fluorescence quenching effect of Ti 3 C 2 NSs, ssDNA probe (P) shows the minimal fluorescent emission. After the formation of duplex structure with its complementary target, ssDNA (T), the fluorescence intensity enhances evidently. Exonuclease III (Exo III) was used to improve the sensitivity by promoting more fluorescence enhancement. This magnified fluorescent sensor for HPV-18 detection shows a low detection limit of 100 pM and a high specificity. Furthermore, the developed DNA sensor can be employed to determine PCR amplified HPV-18 from cervical scrapes samples. It highlights ultrathin Ti 3 C 2 NSs as a potential candidate for construction of fluorescence DNA biosensors with excellent performances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, sodium 2-Mercaptobenzimidazole-5-sulfonate (SMBD) was used as both a protecting ligand and a reducing agent to synthesize highly fluorescent gold nanoclusters (SMBD@AuNCs). When 360 nm was used as the excitation wavelength, the resultant AuNCs exhibited orange-yellow fluorescence with the maximum emission at 630 nm. In addition, it was found that the fluorescent SMBD@AuNCs could been significantly quenched by Hg 2+ over other ions. The phenomenon was further used to design a SMBD@AuNCs-based fluorescence sensing method for the detection of Hg 2+ . Under the optimal conditions, the detection limit of the proposed method for Hg 2+ was 0.5 nM, with a good linear range from 4.0 nM to 20.0 μM (R 2 = 0.999). Then, it could be successfully utilized for determining trace amount of Hg 2+ in real water samples. Furthermore, owing to the excellent biocompatibility, the as-prepared fluorescent AuNCs showed a great potential application in bioimaging fields. Cytotoxicity studies showed that the AuNCs exhibited negligible effects in altering cell proliferation or triggering apoptosis. The as-synthesized AuNCs have been successfully applied as a photoluminescent probe for human bladder cancer cellular imaging. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have drawn increasing attention because of the role which they play in various diseases, including osteosarcoma. So far, the function and mechanism of HOTAIR in osteosarcoma are unclear. In our study, we observed that HOTAIR was elevated accompanied with a decrease of miR-217 and an increase of ZEB1 in human osteosarcoma cells including U2OS, MG63, Saos-2, and SW1353 compared with human osteoblast cell line hFOB. In addition, the subsequent functional assay exhibited that silencing HOTAIR could significantly repress osteosarcoma cell growth, migration, invasion, and induce cell apoptosis capacity, which indicated that HOTAIR exerted an oncogenic role in osteosarcoma. Moreover, it was revealed by using bioinformatics analysis that HOTAIR can be targeted by microRNA-217 (miR-217). miR-217 has been recognized as a crucial tumor suppressive gene in cancers. We verified that mimics of miR-217 were able to suppress the osteosarcoma development. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR showed that HOTAIR siRNA increased miR-217 expression. Besides these, ZEB1 was identified as a downstream gene of miR-217 and we found that HOTAIR can mediate osteosarcoma progress by upregulating ZEB1 expression via acting as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) via miR-217. Taken these together, our findings in this study indicated that HOTAIR/miR-217/ZEB1 axis, as a novel research point can provide new insights into molecular mechanism of osteosarcoma development. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Theranostic nanoplatforms have been recognized for imaging-guided diagnosis and chemotherapy of cancer by integrating imaging function into the drug delivery systems (DDSs). Here, a facile approach was developed for the fabrication of polymeric prodrug microspheres by introducing pH sensitive “off-on” fluorochrome Rhodamine 6G into bioreducible cleavable bisulfide crosslinked PEGylated poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PEG-PGMA) microspheres, followed with chemical conjugation of doxorubicin (DOX) via an acid-labile hydrazone linkage. High drug content of 25.4% was achieved for the final PEG-PGMA-Hy-DOX prodrug microspheres with average hydrodynamic diameter of 332 nm. The in vitro controlled release showed leakage-free in physiological medium but a sustained drug release up to 58% within 56 h in tumor intracellular microenvironment. The cellular experiments showed that the PEG-PGMA-Hy-DOX prodrug microspheres could be effectively internalized into HepG2 cells with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy than the free DOX. Furthermore, they showed fluorescence only in tumor intracellular microenvironment, indicating their promising potential for precise imaging-guided diagnosis and chemotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum nucleoside-derived antiviral drug used in combination pharmacotherapy treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. Current evidence indicates that ribavirin-associated teratogenicity is not significant in humans, but more information about the developmental toxicity and mechanisms involved in ribavirin placental kinetics is required to assure its safe use in pregnancy. Thus, we have investigated potential roles of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs, SLC29A), Na + -dependent influx-mediating concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs, SLC28A), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux pumps, in ribavirin placental pharmacokinetics. Our data indicate that ENT1 participates in uptake of ribavirin by BeWo cells, fresh human placental villous fragments and microvillous plasma membrane (MVM) vesicles while activity of CNTs (probably CNT2) was only observed in BeWo cells. In situ dual perfusion experiments with rat term placenta in an open circuit setup showed that ENT inhibition significantly decreases total ribavirin maternal-to-foetal and foetal-to-maternal clearances. In contrast, no contribution of ABC transporters, p-glycoprotein (ABCB1), breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2), or multidrug resistance-associated protein (ABCC2) was detected in assays with MDCKII cells overexpressing them, or in closed circuit dual perfusion experiments with rat term placenta. In summary, our data show that ribavirin placental pharmacokinetics are largely controlled by ENT1 activity and independent of ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC2 efflux pumps. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a cytokine with potent regulatory effects on different immune cells. Recently, IL-21 has been contemplated for use in the treatment of cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating human IL-21 gene expression has not yet been described. In this study, we initially studied the promoter region and identified the transcription start site. We thereafter described the essential region upstream of the transcription start site and showed the in vivo binding of NFATc2 and SP1 transcription factors to this region, in addition to their positive role in IL-21 expression. We also studied the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating IL-21 expression. We, thus, established the miRNA profile of CD4+CD45RO+ versus CD4+CD45RA+ isolated from healthy volunteers and identified a signature composed of 12 differentially expressed miRNAs. We showed that miR-302c is able to negatively regulate IL-21 expression by binding directly to its target site in the 3′-untranslated region. Moreover, after using fresh human CD4-positive T cells, we observed the high acetylation level of histone H4, an observation well in line with the already described high expression of IL-21 in CD4+CD45RO+ versus CD4+CD45RA+ T cells. Altogether, our data identified different molecular mechanisms regulating IL-21 expression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "By exploiting the chemical versatility and the high water dispersibility of α,β-poly(N-2-hydroxyethyl)D,L-aspartamide, in this work, two different polymer derivatives were synthesized for the first time. Obtained macromolecules were characterized and used to produce hydrogels exploitable for the local release of hydrophobic anticancer drugs. The first derivative, bearing pendant β-cyclodextrins, was employed to solubilize tamoxifen, chosen as a model drug, and to produce a water soluble supramolecular complex, as evidenced through tamoxifen phase solubility studies. The second derivative, bearing pendant Cyclo(Arginine-Glyicine-Asparagine-D-Phenilyalanine-Cysteine) peptide moieties, was used as a macromolecular crosslinker to obtain a hydrogel with cellular recruitment properties. The occurrence of crosslinking between the two derivatives was studied through rheological analysis and different procedures were employed to obtain tamoxifen medicated hydrogels. In vitro release studies, together with cytotoxicity and recruitment experiments, reveal that the obtained hydrogels can control the release of anticancer drugs, have a cytotoxic effect on human breast carcinoma cells and, thanks to the presence of adhesion moieties, are able to recruit cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the present work, we developed nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) as novel fluorescence probe for the quantitative detection of cysteamine. NCDs were synthesized by a rapid one-pot microwave assisted pyrolysis method using tartaric acid as the source of carbon and urea as N-dopant. The synthesized NCDs possessed multicolor (blue, green and red) fluorescence and excitation wavelength dependent emission behaviour. It was found that the fluorescence intensity of NCDs was quenched with the addition of cysteamine which may be attributed to the formation of non-fluorescent ground state complex. Under optimum condition, the linear response was observed in the range of 10–210 μM and the detection limit was found to be 75.6 nM for sensing the cysteamine. Moreover, the proposed sensing methodology showed high selectivity for cysteamine over a number of interfering metal ions and amino acids. The remarkable biocompatibility of NCDs was investigated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells which impacts its immense potential for diagnostic purposes. The proposed sensing method is thus simple with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity. We expect that this method will become a potential tool for the detection of cysteamine in biological samples. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Of the erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular receptors (Ephs), EphB4 has recently emerged as a potential target in several cancers due to its roles in modified cell migration and invasion. As little is known about the roles of EphB4 in glioma, we sought to investigate its function in glioma by in vitro cell migration and invasion assays, immunoblotting and immunostaining. EphB4 was expressed in glioma cell lines and stem-like cell lines. The stimulation of glioma cells with ephrin-B2, the sole ligand of EphB4, conducted EphB4 phosphorylation and suppressed migration and invasion that downregulation of EphB4 using small interfering RNA abrogated. The stimulation also suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt. We confirmed by immunostaining that EphB4-positive cells existing only in the tumor core, whereas ephrin-B2-positive cells widespread in both the tumor core and the invasive area signifying that EphB4-ephrin-B2 reaction occurred only at the tumor core. Taken together, our data suggest that ephrin-B2-dependent EphB4 phosphorylation acts as an anchoring signal to reduce the malignancy by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation in the glioma core, whereas the scarcity of signaling in the tumor periphery promotes invasion into the surrounding brain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Histopathological image analysis works as ‘gold standard’ for cancer diagnosis. Its computer-aided approach has attracted considerable attention in the field of digital pathology, which highly depends on the feature representation for histopathological images. The principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel unsupervised deep learning framework that has shown its effectiveness for feature representation learning. However, PCA is susceptible to noise and outliers to affect the performance of PCANet. The Grassmann average (GA) is superior to PCA on robustness. In this work, a GA network (GANet) algorithm is proposed by embedding GA algorithm into the PCANet framework. Moreover, since quaternion algebra is an excellent tool to represent color images, a quaternion-based GANet (QGANet) algorithm is further developed to learn effective feature representations containing color information for histopathological images. The experimental results based on three histopathological image datasets indicate that the proposed QGANet achieves the best performance on the classification of color histopathological images among all the compared algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Miniaturized devices for the extraction of DNA have been used for assessing genetic material in biological, forensic and environmental samples. However, the ability to isolate trace amounts of highly fragmented DNA from biological fluids remains a challenge. The current work reports a microfluidic approach that combines on line a dynamic magnetic extraction procedure with droplet-based digital PCR (ddPCR). This strategy maximizes the surface area for DNA binding within the chip, in order to capture short DNA fragments, with the possibility of recovering the purified samples into picoliter volumes for high sensitivity mutation detection. The application of this technology to capture circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) from serum samples of cancer patients is demonstrated herein, with efficiencies comparable to standard column-based DNA extraction methods. This technology uses lesser amounts of required material and reagents, and has a higher potential for automation and multiplex DNA analysis. Furthermore, this approach can also be extended for the detection of other circulating biomarkers, such as nucleic acid sequences with aberrant methylation patterns or miRNA. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The biological activity of macrofungal polysaccharides (MFPS) depends on their structural features and is a topic of keen interest for researchers since long time. In this communication, we report a water soluble macrofungal heteropolysaccharide (MFPS1) with a molar weight of ˜145,000 g/mol, obtained through alkali extraction, of the wild mushroom, Marasmiellus palmivorus, with significant immunomodulatory properties. In cancer, after the induction of metastasis, the anticancer immune system becomes unresponsive. By studying cytokine secretion and immune phenotyping, it was observed that MFPS1 reactivated the anticancer immune surveillance system. MFPS1 executed T-cell maturation and activation via M1Φ; and also stimulated natural killer (NK) cell and B-cell population. The entire immune activation pathway corroborates its anticancer activity. The RP-HPLC analysis of hydrolyzed MFPS1 showed arabinose, glucose, galactose and mannose as monosaccharide units. The proposed structure of repeating unit was established from methylation analysis, 1D- and 2D NMR study, HR-MS and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "A versatile of mesoporous silica is designed and operated, including ion doping, surface modify and pore adsorption, based on aqueous well-dispersed. Thus, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform is obtained through endowing some functional materials. Detailedly, Gd ions is introduced to mesoporous silica (GM nanoparticles) via a co-assemble process, which is used as prime carrier with MRI. Furthermore, the surface graft of hyaluronic acid (HA) molecule makes contribution to lymph system-targeted delivery (GMH nanoparticles). Additionally, the introduction of functional molecules including Iopamidol (IGMH nanoparticles) and DOX (DGMH nanoparticles) could combine the diagnosis and therapy with CT and sustained drug release. We present evidence that the IGMH and DGMH nanoparticles are highly targeted to lymph system in vitro and in vivo, and highlight CT and MR imaging of IGMH nanoparticles in lymph system, and chemotherapy and MR imaging of DGMH nanoparticles in lymph cancer. Our results provide a new universal manufacture for mesoporous silica to obtain a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform, has great potential for use in biological applications. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) ranks the most lethal skin cancer worldwide. However, other risk factors have been hardly explored, aside from ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were implied to be potential risk factors for CMM, although all the evidence was obtained from the western countries. This study examined the relationships between plasma levels of PCBs and CMM risk adjusting for sun sensitivity and sun exposure in a Chinese population, using a case-control study, including 450 CMM cases and 500 healthy controls. Plasma levels of a total of 33 PCB congeners were assayed in both cases and controls. Our results showed that there was a significant association between total summed PCB level and CMM risk, with a 1.44-fold increased risk for those in the highest quartile compared to those in the lowest quartile (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02–2.03, P for trend = 0.031). Significantly increased ORs were also observed for individual PCB congeners (PCB52, PCB170 and PCB180). These associations persisted after control for sun sensitivity and sun exposure. Our study represents the first evidence conducted in Asians, and does support the hypothesis that PCB exposure increases CMM risk. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "We report the hydrothermal synthesis of uniform size (∼6 nm) oleic acid capped CoFe 2 O 4 (OA-CoFe 2 O 4 ) nanoparticles. These OA-CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles were initially hydrophobic and not dispersible in water which were transformed into hydrophilic nanoparticles by modifying their surface with citric acid using a rapid mechanochemical ligand exchange process, which makes CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles stable colloidal solution in water. The synthesized citric acid coated CoFe 2 O 4 (CA-CoFe 2 O 4 ) nanoparticles show a high enough and stable zeta potential over 120 days. CA-CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles exhibited high biocompatibility under in vitro cell studies. The specific absorption rate (SAR) of the CA-CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles was measured by induction heating studies. Upon the exposure of AC external magnetic field, the viability of cancer cells was reduced considerably, suggesting efficient potentiality of these CA-CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles for Magnetic Hyperthermia Applications. Present mechanochemical ligand exchange method is proposed as an efficient method for large scale production of biocompatible and water dispersible magnetic oxide nanoparticles for Magnetic Hyperthermia Applications. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Estrogen-related receptor (ERR) α has recently caught the attention of toxicologists, since its gene expression in breast, prostate and endometrial cancers has a poor prognosis for these diseases. In this study, QSAR models for ERRα agonism and luciferase inhibition were developed for the in silico determination of potential ERRα agonists among common endogenous and exogenous substances from the Human Metabolome Database and EU Pesticides Database. The role of the luciferase inhibition model is to detect potential False Positives among predicted ERRα agonists due to interference with the assays reporter. An Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm was used to find optimal models parameters that are optimal for developing models with the best Balance Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and Positive Predictive Value. Optimized models were merged to create combined ones in order to overcome the shortcomings of individual models. Combined models were used for prediction and a final prediction call scheme was designed to combine the ERRα agonism and luminescence inhibition predictions into a clear activity evaluation. 16 chemicals are recommended for ERRα agonism testing, most notable being isoflavones glycitein and naringenin, as well as, several metabolites of daidzein and genistein. The importance of the counterscreen assay and literature data in support of testing is discussed. Models were validated according to OECD principles and a QMRF report for combined ERRα agonism model was created. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: To determine the predictive value of preoperative lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) for pathological and survival outcomes in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). Methods: This retrospective study included 704 UTUC patients between 2008 and 2017. We used a cutoff LMR of 3.6 to evaluate its relationship with oncological outcomes after RNU, using the Kaplan–Meier method and logistic regression models. Results: During median follow-up of 39 months, decreased preoperative LMR was an independent predictor of poor pathological outcomes. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that patients with low LMR (<3.6) had poor cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS); this prognostic value was ascertained for patients with high pathological grade and more advanced stage UTUC, but not for patients with low pathological features. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed that low LMR was an independent predictor of poor CSS, RFS and OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.42, P = 0.02; HR = 1.39, P = 0.008; HR = 1.38, P = 0.017, respectively]. Conclusion: Preoperative low LMR was an independent predictor of poor pathological and oncological outcomes of UTUC after RNU. Subgroup analysis confirmed that the prognostic value of LMR was confined to patients with a high pathological grade and more advanced stage tumor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A water-soluble comb-like porphyrin polymer based on hyaluronic acid (HA) as the main chain and sulfonate substituted tetraphenylporphyrin (TASP) as side groups, named as HA-g-NH-TPP-(SO 3 Na) [(HA-g-TASP)], was designed and synthesized, which could be used as a potential photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT). This photosensitizer displayed high-water solubility, low dark cytotoxicity, high photocytoxiticy and high singlet oxygen yield (Φ Δ = 0.86). The HA-g-TASP was carefully characterized by UV–Vis, FTIR, and 1 H NMR. UV–Vis spectra showed the Q bands of the HA-g-TASP spectrum had a significant red shift about 50 nm to near-infrared (NIR) region compared with TASP, the HA-g-TASP had a smaller energy band gap. The NIR region is known as the transparent window of the organisms, NIR irradiation shows larger penetration distance in tissue. As a novel photosensitizer, HA-g-TASP exhibited low cytotoxicity in dark and also low photocytotoxicity towards normal cells, but performed enhanced photodynamic activity against cancer cells (HeLa cells). As a result, HA-g-TASP with comb-like structure may be a useful photosensitizer for practical photodynamic therapy in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The polymeric micelles were prepared through a copolymerization of allyl polyethylene glycol (APEG) and N-isopropylacrylamide in the presence of 2-aminoethanethiol (AET), followed by a ring opening polymerization of γ-benzyl-L-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride (BLG-NCA). Doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug was covalently conjugated into the core of micelles via hydrazone bonds. The drug loading capacity could reach up to 15% with drug encapsulation efficiency of 80%. The pH/thermo sensitivities were observed in the process of in vitro drug release. The DOX-loaded micelles exhibited accelerated drug release behaviors in an acidic condition, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy was observed. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of micelles against Hela and 3T3 cells was evaluated before and after drug loading. The DOX-loaded micelles showed strong cytotoxic activity to the cancer cells. But the blank micelles showed non-cytotoxicity. Therefore, the thermo/pH dual-responsive polymeric micelles have a promising future applied as a controlled drug delivery system for anticancer drugs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) surface is a generalization of the ROC curve and is widely used for assessment of the accuracy of diagnostic tests on three categories. Verification bias occurs when not all subjects have their labels observed. This is a common problem in disease diagnosis since the gold standard test to get labels, i.e., the true disease status, can be invasive and expensive. The same situation happens in the evaluation of semi-supervised learning, where the unlabeled data are incorporated. A Bayesian approach for estimating the ROC surface is proposed based on continuous data under a semi-parametric trinormality assumption. The proposed method is then extended to situations in the presence of verification bias. The posterior distribution is computed under the trinormality assumption using a rank-based likelihood. The consistency of the posterior under a mild condition is also established. The proposed method is compared with existing methods for estimating an ROC surface. Simulation results show that it performs well in terms of accuracy. The method is applied to evaluate the performance of CA125 and HE4 in the diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) as a demonstration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "An innovative, facile, low- cost and one-pot hydrothermal synthesis was developed for preparing a high fluorescence carbon dots (CDs). In this report for the first time, Lawsonia inermis (Henna) plant as a carbon source was used to produce CDs without adding any chemical reagent and it was characterized by different techniques. The as-synthesized CDs exhibit high stability under various conditions and exceptionally solubility in hydrophilic solvents such as water and ethanol. In addition, the CDs were employed as a biocompatible probe for determination of methotrexate (MTX) in the range of 0.02 μmol L −1 to 18 μmol L −1 with a detection limit as 7 nmol L −1 . Highly selective and sensitive determination of MTX was carried out through the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism. It is noteworthy that, the antibacterial studies of this CDs lead to interesting results which suggested Henna CDs kill Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria like an antibiotic drug. Also, compared with the henna plant, CDs show antibacterial properties in much lower concentrations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor based on hybrids of NaYF 4 :Yb, Tm, zinc oxide (ZnO) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) was constructed to detect alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which possesses the advantages of low background noise and non-damage to the biological substance. Herein, we prepared NaYF 4 :Yb,Tm/ZnO/CdS composite film electrode by pulsed laser deposition. The selected materials of ZnO and CdS can make full use of the upconversion luminescence (˜360 nm, ˜480 nm) of NaYF 4 :Yb,Tm nanophosphors under 980 nm laser excitation. Meanwhile, an effective matching of energy levels between the conduction bands of CdS and ZnO can prompt photoelectrochemical performance of the electrode. The biosensor shows ultrasensitive detection of AFP with a wide linear range from 0.01 ng mL −1 to 200 ng mL −1 and a low detection limit of 5 pg mL −1 . Therefore, the proposed PEC biosensor based on upconversion nanophosphors is potentially attractive for achieving excellent photoelectrochemical biosensor for detection of other cancer markers in clinical analysis. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Motion management in the treatment of lung cancer is necessary to assure highest quality of the delivered radiation therapy. In this study, the breath-hold technique is experimentally investigated for pencil beam scanned (PBS) proton therapy, with respect to the dosimetric effect of residual breath-hold motion. Material and methods: Three-dimensional (3D)-printed tumours extracted from CT scans of three patients were inserted into a dynamic anthropomorphic breathing phantom. The target was set up to move with the individual patient's tumour motion during breath-hold as previously assessed on fluoroscopy. Target dose was measured with radio-chromic film, and both single field uniform dose (SFUD) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans were delivered. Experiments were repeated for each patient without any motion, to compute the relative dose deviation between static and breath-hold cases. Results: SFUD plans showed small dose deviations between static and breath-hold cases, as evidenced by the gamma pass rate (3%, 3 mm) of 85% or higher. Dose deviation was more evident for IMPT plans, with gamma pass rate reduced to 50–70%. Conclusions: The breath-hold technique is robust to residual intra-breath-hold motion for SFUD treatment plans, based on our experimental study. IMPT was less robust with larger detected dose deviations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We studied the behavior of doxorubicin (DOX; an anticancer drug) molecules loaded on a boron nitride oxide nanosheet (BNO-NS) using the density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation methods. We found that DOX molecules in π-π or covalent interaction with BNO-NS preserve their optical properties in water. Moreover, the BNO-NS vector allowed stabilizing the DOX molecules on a cellular membrane contrary to isolated DOX that randomly moved in the solvent box without any interaction with the cell membrane. From these results, we conclude that hydrophilic BNO-NS represents a good candidate for DOX molecule transport and stabilization near a cell membrane. In this drug delivery system, the choice of BNO-NS as nanovector is important because it allows delivering an elevated therapeutic dose directly on the cancer cell target without hindrance of the DOX payload. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) absorbing dyes have been attached much importance recently, since the promising prospect in photoacoustic (PA) imaging and photothermal (PT) therapy in cancer treatment. In this work, PA signal and PT effect of pyrene derivatives (C12 and C13) prepared via click reaction were evaluated, systematically. It was studied about the further application of loading the representative trisubstituted pyrene derivative (C13) into biocompatible liposomes and subsequent PA measurement. C13 showed the excellent PA effect, whether it's embedded or not. Since temperature increment of the dyes were remarkable in PT test, the same representative derivative C13 was picked and loaded into PNIPAM-b-PNBM polymer micelles as photothermal conversion agent. Preliminary studies suggested that the trisubstituted pyrene derivatives had great potential to replace the function of temperature stimulus. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapy agent linked to cognitive deficits in cancer patients received chemotherapy treatment. MTX decreases cell proliferation in the hippocampus, which is concomitant with cognitive deficits in animal models. The present study aimed to investigate the disadvantages of MTX on cognition associated with cell division, survival, and immature neurons involved in hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as the practical neuroprotective effects of melatonin. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given two injections of MTX (75 mg/kg) on days 8 and 15 followed by Leucovorin (LCV, 6 mg/kg) at hours 18, 26, 42, 50 via i.p. injection. Some rats received co-treatment with melatonin (8 mg/kg, i.p. injection) for 15 days before and during MTX administration (preventive), 15 days after MTX administration (recovery), or both (30 days total; throughout). Hippocampal-dependent memory was examined using novel objection location (NOL) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Cell division, survival and immature neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampus were evaluated using immunofluorescence staining. Rats given MTX/LCV were found to have cognitive memory deterioration based on the NOL and NOR tests. Moreover, reductions in cell division, cell survival, and the numbers of immature neurons were detected in the MTX/LCV group when compared to the controls. This damage was not observed in rats in the preventive, recovery, or throughout groups. These findings reveal that melatonin has the potential to diminish the negative effects of MTX on memory and neurogenesis. This also indicates the benefit of melatonin co-administration in patients who undergo chemotherapy treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) affects survival, regulation and differentiation of both central and peripheral nervous system neurons. NGF exerts its effects primarily through tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), inducing a cascade of tyrosine kinase-initiated responses. In spite of its importance, the general behavior of NGF looks contradictory: its effects can be both stimulatory and inhibitory. The present study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms induced by NGF in glioma cancer cells. Methods: The effects of NGF were investigated in high grade glioma and low grade pediatric glioma (PLGG) cell lines through comparative studies. In particular, we investigated TrkA-mediated cellular pathways, molecular signaling, proliferation, cell cycle and cellular senescence. Results: We found that exposure of PLGG cells to NGF produced stable growth arrest with the features of a senescence phenotype but without the expression of anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, a marker of apoptosis. Moreover, NGF treatment promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. In addition, K252a, a TrkA inhibitor, significantly reduced the phosphorylation of the aforementioned signaling pathways, suggesting that NGF-activated ERK1/2 and AKT signaling take place downstream of TrkA-neurotrophin interaction. Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence that NGF can induce senescence of PLGG cells in a receptor-mediated fashion, thus supporting the hypothesis that in the clinical setting NGF might be beneficial to pediatric glioma patients. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "L-Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-Dopa to dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to serotonin. Although DDC has been purified from a variety of peripheral organs, including the liver, kidney and pancreas, the physiological significance of the peripherally expressed enzyme is not yet fully understood. DDC has been considered as a potential novel biomarker for various types of cancer, however, the role of DDC in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be evaluated. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), on the other hand, has been shown to play a key role in the tumorigenesis, proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis of HCC by regulating gene expression. We initially identified the interaction of DDC with PI3K by means of the phage display methodology. This association was further confirmed in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, human embryonic kidney cells, human neuroblastoma cells, as well as mouse brain, by the use of specific antibodies raised against DDC and PI3K. Functional aspects of the above interaction were studied upon treatment with the DDC inhibitor carbidopa and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Interestingly, our data demonstrate the expression of the neuronal type DDC mRNA in HCC cells. The present investigation provides new evidence on the possible link of DDC with the PI3K pathway, underlining the biological significance of this complex enzyme. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM)",

    "Abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a known tumor suppressor, which also exerts a tumor promoting activity at an advanced stage of cancer. Previously, we reported that expression of interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), also known as interferon regulatory factor-8, is positively correlated with TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-β RI) expression in osteosarcoma patient tissues. In this study, we demonstrated that ICSBP upregulated TGF-β RI and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like phenomena in human osteosarcoma cell lines. As determined by soft agar growth of osteosarcoma cells and xenografted mouse models, ICSBP increased tumorigenicity, which was reversed by ICSBP knock-down or a TGF-β RI inhibitor. To test whether ICSBP directly regulates the promoter activity of TGF-β RI, we performed a TGF-β RI promoter assay, an electro mobility shift assay, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that TGF-β RI promoter was activated in ICSBP-overexpressing osteosarcoma cells. Exploiting serial deletions and mutations of the TGF-β RI promoter, we found a putative ICSBP-binding site at nucleotides −216/−211 (GGXXTC) in the TGF-β RI promoter. Our data suggest that ICSBP upregulates TGF-β RI expression by binding to this site, causing ICSBP-mediated tumor progression in osteosarcoma cells. In addition, we found a positive correlation between ICSBP and TGF-β RI expression in several types of tumors using the cBioportal database. We demonstrated that interferon consensus sequence-binding protein upregulates transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor (TGF-β RI) expression by binding to nucleotides −216/−211 (GGXXTC) in the TGF-β RI promoter, which resulted in increased tumorigenicity and tumor progression in human osteosarcoma cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Galbanic acid (GBA) is an active sesquiterpene coumarin derivative, with various medicinal benefits, including anticancer properties. However, the low solubility of GBA is the main limitation of its clinical applications. In this study, we used a nanosystem based on poly (D, l-lactide)–polyethylene glycol (PLA–PEG), for the delivery of GBA to C26 colon carcinoma cells. The physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles (NPs) prepared by the emulsification–evaporation method were evaluated. MTT assay was used to compare the anticell proliferation of GBA and PLA–PEG–GBA against C26 cell lines. PLA–PEG-NPs with an average size of about 140 nm had an enhanced release of GBA at a pH of 5.5 compared with a pH of 7.4. Cytotoxicity studies showed that the IC 50 of the PLA–PEG–GBA NPs (8 µM) was significantly lower than free GBA (15 µM). In the in vivo study, PLA–PEG–GBA NPs exhibited remarkable efficacy and reduced in vivo toxicity in C26 colon carcinoma tumor-bearing female BALB/c mice. To study the antiangiogenesis effect of the NPs, tumor sections were stained with an anti CD34 antibody. The results show the CD34 (+) vessels were decreased in the GBA and PLA–PEG–GBA treated mice by more than 75% and 90%, respectively. These results suggest that the encapsulation of GBA into the PLA–PEG could potentially be used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is known to exert vasculoprotective effects independent of its anti-bacterial properties; however the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. Reversion Inducing Cysteine Rich Protein with Kazal Motifs (RECK) is a cell surface expressed, membrane anchored protein, and its overexpression inhibits cancer cell migration. We hypothesized that minocycline inhibits platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration via RECK upregulation. Our data show that the BB homodimer of recombinant PDGF (PDGF-BB) induced SMC migration and proliferation, effects significantly blunted by pre-treatment with minocycline. Further investigations revealed that PDGF-BB induced PI3K-dependent AKT activation, ERK activation, reactive oxygen species generation, Nuclear Factor-κB and Activator Protein-1 activation, microRNA (miR)-221 and miR-222 induction, RECK suppression, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2 and 9) activation, effects that were reversed by minocycline. Notably, minocycline induced RECK expression dose-dependently within the therapeutic dose of 1–100 μM, and silencing RECK partially reversed the inhibitory effects of minocycline on PDGF-BB-induced MMP activation, and SMC proliferation and migration. Further, targeting MMP2 and MMP9 blunted PDGF-BB-induced SMC migration. Together, these results demonstrate that minocycline inhibits PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation and migration by restoring RECK, an MMP inhibitor. These results indicate that the induction of RECK is one of the mechanisms by which minocycline exerts vasculoprotective effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play significant roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor progression. LINC01433 has been implicated in the progression of lung cancer. However, its biological role in HCC remains poorly understood. In our current study, we focused on the detailed mechanism of LINC01433 in HCC development. First, it was exhibited that LINC01433 was remarkably elevated in HCC cells, which indicated that LINC01433 was involved in HCC. Then, knockdown of LINC01433 was able to restrain HCC cell proliferation and cell colony formation and greatly induced cell apoptosis. On the contrary, overexpression of LINC01433 promoted HCC cell proliferation, increased cell colony formation, and enhanced cell invasion capacity. Subsequently, we found that miR-1301 was remarkably decreased in HCC cells, and it can serve as a target of LINC01433 according to bioinformatics analysis. In addition, the binding correlation between them was validated by performing RNA pull-down experiments and RIP assay. Moreover, STAT3 was predicted and validated as a target of miR-1301, and it was shown that miR-1301 mimics significantly suppressed STAT3 in HCC cells. Finally, in vivo models were established, and the results demonstrated that silencing of LINC01433 could repress HCC development through modulating miR-1301 and STAT3. Taken together, these results indicated in our study that LINC01433 participated in HCC progression through modulating the miR-1301/STAT3 axis and it might act as a novel biomarker in HCC diagnosis and treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor eradication has many challenges due to the difficulty of selectively delivering anticancer drugs to malignant cells avoiding contact with healthy tissues/organs. The improvement of antitumor efficacy and the reduction of systemic side effects can be achieved using drug loaded nanoparticles. In this study, poly (ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles (PECA-NPs) were prepared using an emulsion polymerization method and their potential for cancer treatment was investigated. The size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of prepared nanoparticles are about 80 nm, 0.08 and −39.7 mV, respectively. The stability test shows that the formulation is stable for 15 days, while an increase in particle size occurs after 30 days. TEM reveals the spherical morphology of nanoparticles; furthermore, FTIR and 1 H NMR analyses confirm the structure of PECA-NPs and the complete polymerization. The nanoparticles demonstrate an in vitro concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (Caco-2), as assessed by MTT assay. The anticancer activity of PECA-NPs was studied on 3D tumor spheroids models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and kidney adenocarcinoma cells (A498) to better understand how the nanoparticles could interact with a complex structure such as a tumor. The results confirm the antitumor activity of PECA-NPs. Therefore, these systems can be considered good candidates in tumor treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare malignant salivary gland neoplasm in the pediatric population. Few studies have discussed best practice with respect to diagnosis and treatment in children. Objective: To present our institution's experience with the evaluation and management of pediatric mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the head and neck. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients under 20 years of age diagnosed with mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the head and neck between 1998 and 2017. Data assessed includes demographics, clinical presentation, imaging examinations, histopathology, treatment, complications, local recurrence, distant metastasis, and follow-up. Results: Sixteen patients (10 female, 6 male) were identified with a median age of 12.9 (IQR: 10.9–15.0) years. Tumors were located within the parotid gland (n = 11, 68.8%), accessory lobe of the parotid gland (n = 2, 12.5%), palate (n = 2, 12.5%), and submandibular region (n = 1, 6.3%). In 9 patients (56.3%) a neoplastic etiology was suspected based on the clinical and/or radiographic findings and confirmed pathologically on biopsy or excision. All patients were treated surgically and five patients required adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient had recurrence requiring re-excision. Seven patients (43.8%) had transient facial paresis post-operatively and one had Frey syndrome. Median follow-up time was 59.7 months (IQR: 18.9–99.3). Conclusion: The malignant nature of mucoepidermoid carcinoma requires comprehensive, multidisciplinary management. Imaging and tissue sampling by fine needle aspiration give clinicians the best insight into location and nature of the mass. Complete surgical excision with attention to preservation of facial nerve and achieving negative margins is desired. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs, and play an important role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Circulating miRNAs have increasingly been recognized as biomarkers for detecting and diagnosing those diseases. Few studies have investigated the association of circulating miRNA with the early stages of cognitive impairment, such as mild cognitive impairment, in the general population. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between cognitive function and several serum miRNAs levels related to amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis in a Japanese general population who had never been diagnosed with dementia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 337 Japanese subjects (144 men, 193 women) who attended a health examination. The short form of the Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. Serum levels of 6 miRNAs (let-7d, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-103a) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for lower SMMSE score (SMMSE score < 28) were significantly increased in the lowest tertile of serum miR-20a (OR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09–4.04) and miR-103a (OR, 1.91; 95%CI, 1.00–3.69) compared to the highest tertile. Moreover, serum levels of miR-20a, -27a, and -103a were linearly and positively associated with SMMSE scores after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusion: Low serum levels of miR-20a, -27a, and -103a are independently associated with cognitive impairment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Crocin, a constituent of the saffron spice, exhibits promising antitumor activity in animal models and also inhibits the proliferation of several types of cancer cells in culture. Recently, we have shown that crocin binds to purified tubulin at the vinblastine site, depolymerizes microtubules and induces a mitotic block in cultured cells. Here, we extend our previous suggestion and explore the cellular effects of crocin to further understand its mechanism of action. In a kinetic study, we observed that the crocin-induced depolymerization of microtubules preceded both DNA damage and reactive oxygen species generation indicating that depolymerizing microtubules is the primary action of crocin. Crocin also inhibited the growth of cold-depolymerized microtubules in HeLa cells indicating that it can inhibit microtubule dynamics. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, crocin was found to suppress the spindle microtubule dynamics in live HeLa cells. Further, crocin treatment resulted in activation of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins, BubR1 and Mad2. Similar to other microtubule-targeting agents, crocin also perturbed the localization of end-binding protein EB1 from the growing microtubule ends and enhanced the acetylation of remaining microtubules. Further, crocin was found to bind to purified tubulin with a dissociation constant of 12 ± 1.5 μM. The results suggested that crocin exerted its antiproliferative effect primarily by inhibiting the assembly and dynamics of microtubules. Importantly, the combination of crocin with known anticancer agents like combretastatin A-4, cisplatin, doxorubicin or sorafenib, exerted a strong synergistic cytotoxic effect in HeLa cells indicating that crocin may enhance the effectiveness of other anticancer agents. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Beneficial effects of fish consumption on heart failure (HF) may be modified by contaminants in fish. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are of particular concern as they have been associated with well-established risk factors of HF, but current data are limited. Objectives: We aimed to assess the association between dietary PCB exposure and risk of HF, accounting for dietary intake of long-chain omega-3 fish fatty acids. Design: We used the prospective population-based research structure SIMPLER (previously the Swedish Mammography Cohort and Cohort of Swedish Men) comprising 32,952 women and 36,546 men, free from cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes at baseline in 1997. Validated estimates of dietary PCBs and long-chain omega-3 fish fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] were obtained via a food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Incident cases of HF were ascertained through register linkage. Results: During an average of 12 years of follow-up, we ascertained 2736 and 3128 incident cases of HF in women and men, respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models, mutually adjusted for PCBs and EPA-DHA, the relative risk (RR) for dietary PCB exposure was 1.48 (95% CI 1.12–1.96) in women and 1.42 (95% CI 1.08–1.86) in men, comparing extreme quintiles. Corresponding RRs for EPA-DHA intake were 0.71 (95% CI 0.54–0.93) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.63–1.07), respectively. Conclusions: Dietary exposure to PCBs was associated with an increased risk of HF in both women and men. EPA-DHA intake was associated with a lower risk of HF in women, with a similar tendency in men. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "In this work, axially [3,5-bis(3-pyridin-4-ylpropoxy)phenyl]methoxy groups substituted silicon (IV) phthalocyanine 2, napthalocyanine 3 and their water soluble derivatives 2a, 3a were synthesized and DNA interaction, topoisomerases inhibitory properties, cytotoxicity against five carcinoma cell lines of water soluble derivatives were examined. The calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) binding properties of 2a and 3a were monitored using UV–Vis spectroscopy and agarose gel electrophoresis. The results showed that the compounds interacted to CT-DNA via intercalation with K b values of 3.94 ± (0.15) × 10 6 and 1.08 ± (0.10) × 10 5 M −1 . In DNA cleavage studies, the compounds cleaved to supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA significantly with irradiation as compared to without irradiation. The results of topoisomerases studies claimed that both compounds had inhibitory effects against topoisomerases. In the cytotoxicity studies, the CC 50 values of the compounds were found in range of 2.15–52.97 μM against to five carcinoma cell lines. The SI values of 3a were found as 4.51, 1.43 and 3.66 against A549, BT20 and SK-MEL 128 cell lines. The cell cycle arrest was investigated against A549 cells by flow cytometry and obtained results indicated that both compounds induce cell cycle arrest at G 0 /G 1 phase. All of obtained results demonstrated that 3a had lead anticancer agent toward lung, breast and melanoma due to its high selectivity to cancer cell lines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The matricellular protein periostin (PN) promotes postnatal valve remodeling and maturation. Incomplete remodeling of the valve can trigger degenerative processes that lead to a myxomatous phenotype that includes loss of PN. However, signaling pathways involved that link valvular-interstitial-fibroblast cells (VICs) to proliferation, migration and actin remodeling functions are unclear. The p21-activated kinases (Paks) have been shown to regulate cytoskeleton rearrangements and cell proliferation/adhesion/migration functions in a variety of cellular contexts, including normal cells and cancer cells. This study shows that Pak1, but not Pak2 and Pak4, is a critical mediator of VIC survival and actin organization, and that the molecular signaling regulating actin-remodeling is initiated upon PN/beta-integrin-induced phosphorylation of the focal-adhesion-kinase (Fak) (Y397). Molecular and pharmacological inhibition of key components of PN/Fak/Akt1 signaling abolished the PN-induced actin polymerization and the activation of mTOR, p70S6K and Pak1. Similarly, blocking mTOR inhibited p70S6K, Pak1 phosphorylation and consequently actin-polymerization. Accordingly, inhibiting p70S6K blocked Pak1 phosphorylation and actin polymerization, and subsequently inhibited adhesion and growth of VICs. Periostin-induced Akt1 activation of Pak1 is independent of Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases, and Akt1 is both downstream and upstream of Pak1. Further, the PN-Pak1-induced Akt1 protects cells from apoptosis through suppression of transcriptional activation of Forkhead-Transcription-Factor (FKHR). In contrast, kinase deficient Pak1 increases apoptosis by increasing FKHR-mediated transcriptional activation. These studies define new functional significance of PN-Fak-Akt1-Pak1 signaling that at least partly regulates Akt1-induced actin polymerization and FKHR-mediated transcriptional activation, which may eventually regulate the mature-valve-leaflet remodeling function, and also FKHR-mediated transcriptional activation for pro-survival of VICs. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Core-shell α-Fe 2 O 3 –ZnO structures of different nanotextured morphology were synthesized through wet chemical routes using different solvents like ethanol, ethanolamine, water and acetaldehyde. Morphological tuning using different solvents resulted in the formation of different shapes, such as disc, spindle, rod and sphere (abbreviated as FZ-ND, FZ-NSP, FZ-NR and FZ-NS, respectively). Structural, morphological and compositional characterization of these nanoparticles (NPs) has been carried out. Antibacterial efficacy of the synthesized NPs was checked against Gram negative V. cholerae N16961 (VcN16961) and Gram positive S. aureus bacteria by recording optical density (OD) at different time points. Among the NPs tested, FZ-NSP was found to be the most effective against VcN16961, while FZ-NR showed maximum efficacy against S. aureus, implying the importance of nanotextured surface as well as the morphology in the manifestation of antibacterial activity. The kinetics of growth for both the bacteria has been modelled using logistic approach. Cytotoxicity was evaluated through MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) and against normal human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293). The lesser toxicity of α-Fe 2 O 3 –ZnO towards HEK-293 and the potent anticancer activity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells underline its applicability as anticancer agent. With continued improvement of nanotechnology, this study may pave the way for designing and construction of various morphologically diverse, nanotextured materials with desired functional attributes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The worldwide increase of human life expectancy and the rapid aging of the population will contribute to an increasing prevalence of chronic illness. Even so, individuals who reach very advanced ages often postpone or escape age-related diseases that are common causes of death. Objective: This article aims to examine health-related characteristics of two distinct samples of Portuguese centenarians (one predominantly rural – PR vs. one predominantly urban - PU), and explore potential dissimilarities in their morbidity profiles and use of health care services. Methods: A total of 241 centenarians were considered. Sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and use of health care services were assessed by semi-structured interviews with the centenarians and their proxies (family or formal caregiver). Results: A higher average of 4.80 self-reported illnesses (sd = 2.01) were found in the PU sample (vs. 2.96; sd = 1.77 in the PR sample); in overall the PR sample presented a better health condition with lower levels of physical and mental impairments, and a greater number of centenarians who did not succumb to the three most common lethal diseases (heart disease, non-skin cancer and stroke) in the elderly population (85.4% vs. 60% in the PU sample). Conclusions: Portuguese centenarians experienced a substantial number of illnesses, but an overall better health status was found in centenarians from the PR area. By providing distinctive health-related profiles, our findings suggest the importance of contextual factors in shaping how very advanced ages may be achieved. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to derive distant metastases (DM) risk-groups in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients treated with postoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy (PO-IMRT). Methods: OSCC patients treated with PO-IMRT were divided into discovery (2005–2012) and validation (2013–2014) cohorts. DM predictors were identified from multivariable analysis (MVA) to derive low- and high-risk groups in the discovery-cohort. The result was subsequently evaluated in validation-cohort. Results: Overall 447 patients were included (discovery-cohort: n = 300, and validation-cohort: n = 147). Between the two cohorts, there were no significant differences in DM (p = 0.16) or OS (p = 0.26). MVA identified pN2-3 and histological grade 2–3 (G2-3) as DM predictors. High-risk group included patients who had both poor predictors (pN2-3 and G2-3), while low-risk group included patients with no or only one poor predictor. In discovery-cohort, 3-year distant control (DC) was 78% and 97% in high- and low-risk groups respectively (p < 0.001, concordance index = 0.72). In validation-cohort, risk-group classification performed similarly (concordance index = 0.73). The 3-year OS for high- versus low-risk group was 85% versus 95% in discovery-cohort (p < 0.001), and 74% versus 93% in validation-cohort (p < 0.001). Conclusion: A model (G2-3/pN2-3) which identifies high DM risk was validated internally. This model might be used to design future prospective studies investigating treatment intensification and/or DM surveillance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the present investigation, FePt alloy nanoparticles were synthesized with controlled size and elemental composition followed by surface modification using (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES). Lenalidomide was covalently bound to FePt-NH 2 by pH sensitive hydrazone bonding. Hyaluronic acid was conjugated to amino groups of APTES while lactoferrin (Lf) was directly conjugated to excess carboxylic group present on hyaluronic acid (HA) to form surface modified pH sensitive alloy-drug nanoconjugates (SPANs). The multifunctional nanoconjugates were characterized and evaluated using extensive in vitro and in vivo techniques. The nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent heating ability on exposure to alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation. The acidic microenvironment of lysozome triggered release of LND from SPANs. Owing to leaching of Fe and Pt contents, SPANs demonstrated ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87MG cell line which further enhanced therapeutic effect of SPANs. Significant difference in cell viability suppression was observed in in vitro photothermal, chemo-photothermal and chemo-magnetophotothermal killing of cancer cells using SPANs in U87MG cell lines. Significant difference in heating ability and cell cytotoxicity of SPANs in comparison to alternative magnetic field and NIR irradiation was observed for DUAL-mode exposure of SPANs. The results of cellular internalization study showed efficient internalization of SPANs inside U87MG cells. The in vivo results (both qualitative and quantitative) confirmed enhanced uptake of SPANs in brain after intranasal administration with enhanced nasal and mucus penetration owing to presence of Lf. No significant interaction was observed with ECM and mucin due to presence of carboxyl group on SPANs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the impact of long noncodingRNA (lncRNA) colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) on hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cell propagation, invasion, and migration by mediating miR-203/ BCAT1 axis. Methods: Microarray analysis was based on 25 pairs of HCC cancerous tissues and adjacent tissues. The expression levels of CRNDE, miR-203, and BCAT1 in HCC tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The liver cell line L-02 and HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh-7 were utilized to assess the regulatory eﬀects of CRNDE and miR-203 on HCC progression in vitro. Western blot was used to qualify BCAT1 protein expression level. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis, whereas cell invasion and migration assay were performed by the Transwell assay. The relationship among CRNDE, miR-203, and BCAT1 was validated by dual luciferase assay. Tumor Xenograft study was established to verify the pathological effect of CRNDE on HCC development in vivo. Results: The expression levels of the CRNDE and BCAT1 were upregulated in HCC tissues and cells, whereas miR-203 was downregulated in HCC. Knockdown of CRNDE or miR-203 overexpression would inhibit HCC cell propagation and metastasis, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-203 was negatively correlated with CRNDE, the same as miR-203 with BCAT1. Dual luciferase assay showed that miR-203 was an inhibitory target of CRNDE, and BCAT1 was directly targeted by miR-203 as well. Conclusion: LncRNA CRNDE could enhance HCC tumorgenesis by sponging miR-203 and mediating BCAT1. LncRNA CRNDE might facilitate HCC cell propagation, invasiveness, and migration through regulating miR-203/ BCAT1 axis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A novel type of microcontainers based on hollow silver alginate microspheres and magnetite nanoparticles is reported as development of recently published technology. Magnetite nanoparticles were incorporated by two methods - co-precipitation with porous calcium carbonate during template formation and adsorption onto CaCO 3 particles or microcontainers’ shell. Amount of magnetite loaded and microshells size (4.6 to 6.9 μm) were found to depend on the chosen method for magnetite nanoparticles incorporation. Stability of hollow microshells in saline, phosphate buffer and culturing media was studied. Microcontainers’ susceptibility to magnetic field was investigated in solutions of varied viscosity, and their group movement velocity under constant magnetic field was evaluated by sequential optical microscopy imaging. Cell viability tests with prepared microshells were performed that demonstrated negligible cytotoxicity effect on human dermal fibroblasts cells. With HeLa cells moderate viability inhibition was found at high carriers:cells ratio at early time points which is attributed to more active and receptor-mediated endocytosis of carriers as well as known cytotoxicity of magnetite in some cancer cells. At 24 and 48 h time points HeLa cells proliferation fully recovers. Reported data opens perspectives for further biomedical-oriented studies and application of this novel kind of microcontainers with a number of techniques applicable for imaging, control and triggered cargo release provided by presence of silver and magnetite nanoparticles in the carriers and their suitability for further versatile functionalization by traditional LbL approach if needed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nanoparticle-based therapies have emerged as a promising approach to overcome limitations of conventional chemotherapy. Present study investigates the potential of oleic acid-functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles (MN-OA) to enhance the radiation response of fibrosarcoma tumor and elucidates its underlying mechanism. Methods: Various cellular and molecular assays (e.g. MTT, clonogenic, cell cycle analysis, cell death, DNA damage/repair) and tumor growth kinetics were employed to investigate the mechanism of MN-OA induced radio-sensitization. Results: Mouse (WEHI-164) and human (HT-1080) fibrosarcoma cells treated with MN-OA and gamma-radiation (2 Gy) showed a significant decrease in the cell proliferation. Combination treatment showed significant decrease in clonogenic survival of WEHI-164 cells and was found to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe. The mechanism of radio-sensitization was found to involve binding of MN-OA with HSP90, resulting in down-regulation of its client proteins, involved in cell cycle progression (Cyclin B1 and CDC2) and DNA-double strand break repair (e.g. RAD51 and BRCA1). Consistently, longer persistence of DNA damage in cells treated with MN-OA and radiation was observed in the form of γ-H2AX foci. The efficacy and mechanism of MN-OA-induced radio-sensitization was also validated in an immuno-competent murine fibrosarcoma model. Conclusion: This study reveals the key role of HSP90 in the mechanism of tumor radio-sensitization by MN-OA. General significance: Present work provides a deeper understanding about the mechanism of MN-OA-induced tumor radiosensitization, highlighting the role of HSP90 protein. In addition to diagnostic and magnetic hyperthermia abilities, present remarkable radiosensitizing activity of MN-OA would further excite the clinicians to test its anti-cancer potential. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an effective target for the treatment of many epithelial cancers. However, EGFR inhibitors have low clinical response rates and are prone to drug resistance arising from mutations and heterodimerization of EGFR. Therefore, targeting the highly conserved dimer interface of EGFR may be an effective strategy for improving the clinical response of anti-EGFR therapies. Nanobodies have significant advantages over conventional antibodies in terms of size, solubility, stability and cost-effectiveness. To investigate the feasibility of nanobodies targeting the dimer interface of EGFR as novel anticancer drugs, four nanobodies were screened from a commercial humanized nanobody phage antibody library using the EGFR 237−267 peptide from the β-hairpin loop of the dimer interface of EGFR as the antigen. A nanobody with an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.6, named EGFR dimer Nb77, was selected for further analysis of anticancer activities. EGFR dimer Nb77 was expressed in Escherichia coli Shuffle T7-B as a soluble (His) 6 -tagged protein and purified by a CM Sepharose column and a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column. Purified EGFR dimer Nb77 could specifically bind to the surface of EGFR-overexpressing A431 cells in a dose-dependent and ligand-dependent manner, and this nanobody could effectively inhibit the growth of the tumour cells, with an inhibition rate similar to that of the monoclonal antibody EGFR dimer 5G9, which also targets the dimer interface of EGFR. This work is the first to prove that nanobodies targeting the dimer interface of EGFR have promising prospects as anticancer agents. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "As one of critical base excision repair enzymes, uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) can specifically repair uracil-induced DNA damage to maintain the genome integrity of organisms. Moreover, abnormal expression of UDG is related to various cancers and other serious diseases. Therefore, it is essential to accurately and sensitively monitor UDG activity. In this work, a ratiometric fluorescence method using poly-(thymine) DNA template copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as the output signals is developed for simple, selective, and sensitive detection of UDG. A double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) consisting of a uracil-containing single chain and a trigger sequence is designed as a substrate dsDNA. Meanwhile, another dsDNA comprising 30 pairs of A-T bases ((AT) 30 dsDNA) is designed to be partially complementary to the trigger chain. The (AT) 30 dsDNA itself has no blunt or recessed 3′ end and cannot be cut by exonuclease III (Exo III). With the Exo III-assisted amplification, adding UDG results in the success synthesis of red-emissive Cu NCs, while the dsDNAs in the system are hydrolyzed and the fluorescence signal of DAPI is weak. In contrast, without addition of UDG, the fluorescence intensity of Cu NCs is low, while the DAPI emits significantly enhanced fluorescence signal. The proposed method presents a detection limit of 5.0 × 10 −5 U mL −1 and can be applied to the HeLa cell lysate sample with satisfactory results. Additionally, the kinetic parameter is studied and the UDG inhibition effect is evaluated. In summary, this work provides a potential platform for DNA repair enzyme-related analysis and clinical diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment is characteristically acidic and this extracellular acidosis is known to play a role in carcinogenesis and metastasis and can affect tumor chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. Intracellular pH has been used as a possible biomarker of salvageable tissue in ischemic stroke. A non-invasive MRI-based approach for the determination and imaging of cerebral pH would be a powerful tool in cancer diagnosis and monitoring, as well as stroke treatment planning. Several pH-based MRI imaging approaches have been proposed but for these to be useful, disentangling the effects of pH from other parameters which may affect the measured MRI signal is crucial to ensure accuracy and specificity. R 1 relaxation in the rotating frame (R 1 ρ ) is an example of a method that has been proposed to probe pH in vivo using MRI. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between R 1 ρ , pH, and macromolecular density in vitro using phantoms and in human volunteers. Here we show that the rate of R 1 ρ relaxation (=1/T 1 ρ ) varies with pH but only in the presence of macromolecules. At constant pH, phantom macromolecular density inversely correlated with R 1 ρ . R 1 ρ imaging of the normal human brain demonstrated regional heterogeneity with significant differences between structurally distinct regions, which are likely to be independent of pH. For example, R 1 ρ was higher in the basal ganglia compared to grey matter and higher in grey matter compared to white matter. We conclude that R 1 ρ cannot be reliably used to image tissue pH without deconvolution from the effects of local tissue macromolecular composition. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the prognostic value of skull-base invasion (SBI) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), propose a subclassification of SBI. Methods: 792 and 433 patients with pathologically proven NPC and complete clinical and magnetic resonance imaging records at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and Foshan Hospital were enrolled, and investigated using heat map/cluster, network and survival analyses. Results: The results of heat map/cluster analyses and network analysis showed that T3 patients with pterygoid process and/or base of the sphenoid bone invasion (T3 slight) had better treatment outcomes than those with other SBIs (T3 severe). Significant differences were observed between T3-slight and T3-severe groups with regard to 5-year overall survival (OS) (93.0% vs. 83.5%, p = 0.014) and progression-free survival (PFS) (82.5% vs. 74.1%, p = 0.044) rates. No significant difference was observed between T3-slight group and T2 patients with regard to 5-year OS (93.0% vs. 84.7%, p = 0.062) and PFS (82.5% vs. 78.9%, p = 0.459) rates. Therefore, we downgraded patients with T3 slight to T2, yielding a new T classification sample. The survival curves of the 5-year OS and PFS rates of T2 and T3 were more reasonable after sample redistribution than those before sample redistribution. The differences in the 5-year OS and PFS rates between T2 and T3 patients after sample redistribution approached significance (p = 0.075 and 0.051, respectively). Conclusions: Different types of SBIs had different effects on the prognosis for NPC. We recommend patients with T3 slight not be defined as T3 but, rather, as T2. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (AILI) is a significant clinical problem worldwide, the hepatotoxicity mechanisms are well elucidated, but the factors involved in the necrosis and repair still remain to be investigated. APAP was injected intraperitoneally in male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Quantitative proteome analysis of liver tissues was performed by 2-nitrobenzenesulfenyl tagging, two-dimensional-nano high-performance liquid chromatography separation, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry analysis. Diffrenetial proteins were verified by the immunochemistry method. 36 and 44 differentially expressed proteins were identified, respectively, at 24 hr after APAP (200 or 300 mg·kg −1 ) administration. The decrease in the mitochondrial protective proteins Prdx6, Prdx3, and Aldh2 accounted for the accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and aldehydes, impairing mitochondria structure and function. The Gzmf combined with Bax and Apaf-1 jointly contributed to the necrosis. The blockage of Stat3 activation led to the overexpression of unphosphorylated Stat3 and the overproduction of Bax. The overexpression of unphosphorylated Stat3 represented necrosis; the alternation from Stat3 to p-Stat3 in necrotic regions represented hepatocytes from death to renewal. The high expressions of P4hα1, Ncam, α-SMA, and Cygb were involved in the liver repair, they were not only the markers of activated HSC but also represented an intermediate stage of hepatocytes from damage or necrosis to renewal. Our data provided a comprehensive report on the profile and dynamic changes of the liver proteins in AILI; the involvement of Gzmf and the role of Stat3 in necrosis were revealed; and the role of hepatocyte in liver self-repair was well clarified. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Although stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the standard of care for inoperable early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), its role for medically operable patients remains controversial. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a multi-institutional study to assess post-SBRT disease control and survival outcomes in medically operable patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including patients with biopsy-proven cT1-2N0M0 NSCLC treated with definitive SBRT (2006–2015). Per patient charts, inoperability referred to documentation of poor surgical candidacy with a given rationale for lack of resection. Charts of operable patients contained documentation of patients refusing surgery or choosing SBRT, without a documented rationale for inoperability. Subjects were excluded in cases of ambiguity regarding the aforementioned definitions and/or lack of clearly documented operability status. Endpoints included local failure (LF) and regional-distant failure, both evaluated with Fine and Gray competing risks regression; Kaplan-Meier methodology analyzed overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Of 952 patients, 408 (42.9%) were operable, and 544 (57.1%) were inoperable. Median follow-up was 22 months. Two-year LF was 9.7% in operable patients and 8.2% in inoperable patients (p = 0.36). There was no statistical difference in regional-distant failure (p = 0.55) between cohorts. Operable patients experienced statistically higher OS (p = 0.04), but not PFS (p = 0.11). Respective 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS in operable patients were 85.4%, 66.2%, and 51.2%. Conclusions: Although patients with operable NSCLC experience higher OS than their inoperable counterparts, disease-related outcomes are similar. These results may better inform shared decision-making between medically operable patients and their multidisciplinary providers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Since Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles synthesized by plant extracts possess good bio-compatibility and superparamagnetic properties, the possibility of these could be used as a carrier in drug delivery. In this work, doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), an anti-cancer drug, loaded on glutaric anhydride-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -Glu) was investigated at varying pH values for effective drug delivery. Various factors affecting the adsorption of DOX onto the Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -Glu were examined, where the adsorption efficiency of DOX reached 92% at a concentration of 20 mg/L employing 10 mg of Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -Glu at 303 K in pH 7.4. However, the adsorption efficiency of DOX was decreased to 18% at acidic pH value down to 3.0, implicating that the drug releasing process was controlled by pH. Adsorption kinetics was fitting to pseudo-second-order and the isothermal adsorption conformed to Freundlich isotherm. The morphology and surface composition of the synthesized Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -Glu were characterized by SEM, TEM, and N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing that the specific surface area being 62.6 m 2 /g and the size ranging from ~30 to 50 nm. The zeta potential results indicated that Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -Glu were negatively charged in various pH from 3 to 8.5. Characterizations by FTIR and UV–Vis techniques suggested that the DOX was absorbed and it can be delivered by Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -Glu. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The compound, [dmpH] 2 [pydc] (L) as ligand was synthesized by the proton-transfer reaction of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (pydcH 2 ) with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (dmap). The new coordination complexes of [dmpH] 2 [La 2 (pydc) 4 (H 2 O) 4 ]·2H 2 O (1) and [dmpH] 2 [Ce(pydc) 3 ]·2H 2 O (2) were prepared from the reaction of the ligand with La(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O and Ce(SO 4 ) 2 ·4H 2 O metal salts, respectively. All structures were characterized by X-ray crystallography. Cytotoxicity of compounds was tested under MTT method, against HT29 (a human colon adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (a human liver hepatocellular carcinoma) and HL60 (a human lymphocyte) cell lines. Complex (1) with IC 50 values of about 1–100 μM was more active than other compounds on all three cell lines. The strongest anti-proliferative effect was observed for (1) toward HL60 cell line with IC 50 value equal to 1 μM. High cytotoxicity of complexes indicated that they can be further evaluated for cancer treatment in the next set. UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy, emission titration and viscosity were employed to investigate the mode of interaction between (L), (1) and (2) with calf-thymus DNA. All studies represented that (L), (1) and (2) interact with CT-DNA via intercalation mode. A direct correlation was recognized between inhibitory and DNA interaction potent of the compounds. Also, the results of molecular docking were in agreement with obtained experimental data of DNA interaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Currently in diagnostic setting for breast cancer, FFDM and DBT are performed conjunctively. However, performing two imaging modalities may increase radiation exposure by double. Two-dimensional reconstructed images created from DBT with 2DSM, has a potential to replace conventional FFDM in concerning both radiation dosage and image quality. With increasing concerns for individual radiation exposure, studies analyzing radiation dosage in breast imaging modalities are needed. This study compared radiation dosage and image quality between DBT + 2DSM versus FFDM. Methods and materials: 374 patients (mean age 52 years) who underwent both DBT and FFDM were retrospectively reviewed. Radiation dosage data were obtained by radiation dosage scoring and monitoring program Radimetrics (Bayer HealthCare, Whippany, NJ). Entrance dose and mean glandular doses in each breast were obtained for both modalities. To compare image quality of DBT + 2DSM and FFDM, a 5-point scoring system for lesion clarity was assessed. The parameters of radiation dosage (entrance dose, mean glandular dose) and image quality (lesion clarity scoring) were compared. Results: For entrance dose, DBT had lower mean dosage (14.8 mGy) compared with FFDM (21.8 mGy, p-value < 0.0001). Mean glandular doses for both breasts were lower in DBT (Left 1.74, Right 2.1) compared with FFDM (Left 2.85, Right 2.74, p-value < 0.0001). Lesion clarity score was higher in DBT with 2DSM (mean score 4.03) compared with FFDM (3.82, p-value < 0.0001). Conclusion: DBT showed lower radiation entrance dose and mean glandular doses to both breasts compared with FFDM. DBT + 2DSM had better image quality than FFDM, suggesting that DBT with 2DSM has potential as an alternative to FFDM. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) in mitochondria plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Mitochondrial matrix pyridine nucleotides are potent regulators of the PTP, but the role of extramitochondrial nucleotides is unclear. Methods: The PTP opening was explored in isolated mitochondria and mitochondria in permeabilized differentiated and undifferentiated cells in the presence of added NAD(P)(H) in combination with Mg 2+ , adenine nucleotides (AN), and the inhibitors of AN translocase (ANT), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and cyclophilin D. Results: Added NAD(H) and AN, but not NADP(H), inhibited the PTP opening with comparable potency. PTP suppression required neither NAD(H) oxidation nor reduction. The protective effects of NAD(H) and cyclosporin A were synergistic, and the effects of NAD(H) and millimolar AN were additive. The conformation-specific ANT inhibitors were unable to cancel the protective effect of NADH even under total ANT inhibition. Besides, NAD(H) activated the efflux of mitochondrial AN via ANT. VDAC ligand (Mg 2+ ) and blockers (G3139 and 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid) potentiated and attenuated the protective effect of NAD(H), respectively. However, in embryonic and cancer (undifferentiated) cells, in contrast to isolated differentiated hepatocytes and cardiocytes, the suppression of PTP opening by NADH was negligible though all cells tested possessed a full set of VDAC isoforms. Conclusions: The study revealed a novel mechanism of PTP regulation by external (cytosolic) NAD(H) through the allosteric site in the OM or the intermembrane space. General significance: The mechanism might contribute to the resistance of differentiated cells under different pathological conditions including ischemia/reperfusion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant and aggressive glioma with abnormal expression of genes that mediate glycolytic metabolism and tumor cell growth. Petunidin-3-O-glucoside (Pt3glc) is a kind of anthocyanin in the red grape and derived beverages, representing the most common naturally occurring anthocyanins with a reduced incidence of cancer and heart diseases. In this study, whether Pt3glc could effectively regulate glycolysis to inhibit GBM cell was investigated by using the DBTRG-05MG cell lines. Notably, Pt3glc displayed potent antiproliferative activity and significantly changed the protein levels related to both glycolytic metabolism and GBM cell survival. The expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X protein was increased with concomitant reduction on the levels of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 and caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, the levels of survival signaling proteins, such as protein kinase B (Akt) and phospho-Akt (Scr473), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phospho-ERK, were significantly decreased by Pt3glc in combination with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor of LY294002. Most importantly, the levels of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and phosphorylated p53 were also downregulated, indicating that Pt3glc combinated with PI3K inhibitor could induce GBM cell death may act via the SIRT3/p53-mediated mitochondrial and PI3K/Akt-ERK pathways. Our findings thus provide rational evidence that the combination of Pt3glc with PI3K inhibitor, which target alternative pathways in GBM cells, may be a useful adjuvant therapy in glioblastoma treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Sialic acid (SA) is a notable tumor marker in human. Its increased level beyond the normal concentration in human biological samples is related to different kinds of cancers development. In this contribution, a novel colorimetric assay is reported for SA detection in form of N-acetylneuraminic acid. The sensitive detection strategy is proposed via the specific SA induced aggregation of 3‑aminophenyl boronic acid (3APBA) assembled on dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-DSP). DSP was functionalized on AuNPs through a strong Au–S interaction and 3APBA was assembled on AuNPs-DSP by the amine coupling reaction between the carboxyl group of DSP on gold nanoparticles surface and the amino group of 3APBA to generate a covalent amide bond. The addition of 3APBA to buffered AuNPs-DSP generated a ruby red colloidal nanosensor. With increasing concentration of SA, a probe color turned rapidly from red to blue-gray via aggregation of AuNPs-DSP-3APBA. At optimal conditions, the absorbance ratio (A 700 /A 520 ) was linear with SA concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 0.25 mM and 0.30–0.70 mM. A limit of detection of 35.0 μM was achieved which is the lowest amongst reported colorimetric methods for SA determination. The practical efficacy of the assay was demonstrated on human serum, along with no interfering effects and satisfactory accuracy and precision. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "At present, there is a higher demand for the efficacy of nanoparticle drugs. It is hoped that more drugs will reach the tumor site and that the drug will be less harmful to other normal cells of the body before reaching the tumor site. Most target research for nanomedicine can achieve better positioning through complex processes, such as synthesis. To overcome these difficulties, such as the complexity of the preparation method and lack of good targeting, we used simple polydopamine (PDA) as a pH-sensitive targeting anchor for nanoparticles (NPs). We successfully conjugated folic acid (FA) to the surface of honokiol (HK) nanoparticles coated with PDA using a typical surface modifier. After preparation into HK-PDA-FA-NPs, we characterized the particle size, potential and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The targeted nanoparticles (HK-PDA-FA-NPs) can be stably present in various physiological media and exhibit pH sensitivity during drug release in vitro. HK-PDA-FA-NPs have better targeting ability to 4T1 cells than HK-NPs. Targeted nanoparticles have a tumor inhibition rate of greater than 80% in vivo, which is significantly higher than ordinary HK-NPs. This experiment shows that surface modification of HK-NPs coated with PDA is a promising preparation method for targeted therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Study objective: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy of women all over the world. In this study, we compared the effects of ultrasound-guided modified pectoral nerve (PECS) block and erector spinae plane (ESP) block on postoperative opioid consumption, pain scores, and intraoperative fentanyl need of patients undergoing unilateral modified radical mastectomy surgery. Design: Single-blinded, prospective, randomized, efficacy study. Setting: Tertiary university hospital, postoperative recovery room and surgical ward. Patients: Forty patients (ASA I–II) were allocated to two groups. After exclusion, 38 patients were included in the final analysis (18 patients in the PECS groups and 20 in the ESP group). Interventions: Modified pectoral nerve block was performed in the PECS group and erector spinae plane block was performed in the ESP group. Measurements: Postoperative tramadol consumption and pain scores were compared between the groups. Also, intraoperative fentanyl need was measured. Main results: Postoperative tramadol consumption was 132.78 ± 22.44 mg in PECS group and 196 ± 27.03 mg in ESP group (p = 0.001). NRS scores at the 15th and 30th min were similar between the groups. However, median NRS scores were significantly lower in PECS group at the postoperative 60th min, 120th min, 12th hour and 24th hour (p = 0.024, p = 0.018, p = 0.021 and p = 0.011 respectively). Intraoperative fentanyl need was 75 mg in PECS group and 87.5 mg in ESP group. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.263). Conclusion: Modified PECS block reduced postoperative tramadol consumption and pain scores more effectively than ESP block after radical mastectomy surgery. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Hydrophobic drugs, such as methotrexate, are not easily delivered into the human body. Therefore, the use of amphiphilic nanoplatforms to the transport of these drugs through the bloodstream is a challenge. While the hydrophobic region interacts with the drug, the hydrophilic outer layer enhances its bioavailability and circulation time. Poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) PEG-b-PCL micelles are biodegradable and biocompatible, allowing its use as a nanocarrier for drug delivery systems. The stealth property of PEG that composes the outer layer of nanoplatforms, makes the micelle unperceivable to phagocytic cells, increasing the circulation time in the human body. In addition, folic acid functionalization enables micelle selectively targeting to cancer cells, improving treatment efficiency and reducing side effects. In this work, PEG-b-PCL copolymer was synthesized by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of the ε-caprolactone with Poly(ethylene glycol) as a macroinitiator and tin(II) 2-ethyl hexanoate as a catalyst. Functionalization of such micelles with folic acid occurred through the modification of the PEG terminal group. The surface modification of the copolymer micelles resulted in higher critical micellar concentration (CMC), increasing approximately 100 times. The synthesis of the copolymers resulted in molecular weight around 3000 g mol −1 with low polydispersity. The polymer micelles have a hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 100–200 nm and the functionalized sample doesn't show aggregation in the considered pH range. High incorporation efficiency was obtained with a minimum percentage of 85%.

    "Abstract": "Background: The obesity epidemic has prompted the need to better understand the impact of adipose tissue on human pathophysiology. However, accurate, efficient, and replicable models of quantifying adiposity have yet to be developed and clinically implemented. We propose a novel semiautomated radiologic method of measuring the visceral fat area (VFA) using computed tomography scan analysis. Materials and methods: We obtained a cohort of 100 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, with a median age of 60.9 y (age range: 35-87 y) and an average body mass index of 28.8 kg/m 2 ± 6.56 kg/m 2 . The semiautomated quantification method of adiposity was developed using a commercial imaging suite. The method was compared to two manual delineations performed using two different picture archiving communication systems. We quantified VFA, subcutaneous fat area (SFA), total fat area (TFA), and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (V/S ratio) on computed tomography axial slices that were at the L4-L5 intervertebral level. Results: The semiautomated method was comparable to manual measurements for TFA, VFA, and SFA with intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.99, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively. However, the ICC for the V/S ratio was only 0.44, which led to the identification of technical outliers that were identified using robust regression. After removal of these outliers, the ICC improved to 0.99 for TFA, VFA, and SFA and 0.97 for the V/S ratio. Measurements from the manual methodology highly correlated between the two picture archiving communication system platforms, with ICC of 0.98 for TFA, 0.98 for VFA, 0.96 for SFA, and 0.95 for the V/S ratio. Conclusions: This semiautomated method is able to generate precise and reproducible results. In the future, this method may be applied on a larger scale to facilitate risk stratification of patients using measures of abdominal adiposity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Recently, inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (hCA) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) have appeared as a promising approach for pharmacological intervention in a variety of disorders such as glaucoma, epilepsy, obesity, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Keeping this in mind, N,N′-bis[(1-aryl-3-heteroaryl)propylidene]hydrazine dihydrochlorides, N1-N11, P1, P4-P8, and R1-R6, were synthesized to investigate their inhibitory activity against hCA I, hCA II, and AChE enzymes. All compounds in N, P, and R-series inhibited hCAs (I and II) and AChE more efficiently than the reference compounds acetazolamide (AZA), and tacrine. According to the activity results, the most effective inhibitory compounds were in R-series with the Ki values of 203 ± 55–473 ± 67 nM and 200 ± 34–419 ± 94 nM on hCA I, and hCA II, respectively. N,N′-Bis[1-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(morpholine-4-yl)propylidene]hydrazine dihydrochlorides, N8, in N-series, N,N′-Bis[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(piperidine-1-yl)propylidene]hydrazine dihydrochlorides, P4, in P-series, and N,N′-bis[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(pyrrolidine-1-yl)propylidene]hydrazine dihydrochlorides, R5, in R-series were the most powerful compounds against hCA I with the Ki values of 438 ± 65 nM, 344 ± 64 nM, and 203 ± 55 nM, respectively. Similarly, N8, P4, and R5 efficiently inhibited hCA II isoenzyme with the Ki values of 405 ± 60 nM, 327 ± 80 nM, and 200 ± 34 nM, respectively. On the other hand, P-series compounds had notable inhibitory effect against AChE than the reference compound tacrine and the Ki values were between 66 ± 20 nM and 128 ± 36 nM. N,N′-Bis[1-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(piperidine-1-yl)propylidene]hydrazine dihydrochlorides, P7, was the most potent compound on AChE with the Ki value of 66 ± 20 nM. The other most promising compounds, N,N′-bis[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(morpholine-4-yl)propylidene]hydrazine dihydrochlorides, N4 in N-series and N,N′-bis[1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(pyrrolidine-1-yl)propylidene]hydrazine dihydrochlorides, R4 in R-series were againts AChE with the Ki values of 119 ± 20 nM, 88 ± 14 nM, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The upgrade of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) began in 2000 to enhance the performance in nuclear physics, atomic physics, irradiative materials, and biology, cancer therapy using heavy ions and hadron physics. The upgraded program of HIRFL aimed to provide all ions from protons to uranium for higher beam intensity. As one of subprojects upgrade program in HIRFL, the low-level radio frequency (LLRF) system is also completely redesigned to better stabilize the beam acceleration parameters during the machine operation. The purpose of this article is to describe the design and implementation of the new fully digital LLRF system for six sets of radio frequency (RF) systems at the HIRFL. All components, including the quadrature demodulation, phase and amplitude detectors, phase shifter, and proportional integral (PI) loop filter, were designed in detail and realized in field programmable gate array (FPGA). A special synchronous RF source was designed to provide a phase reference for the different RF systems. A new tuning system was designed to ensure that the RF system remains in a good working state. An economical compensation method for the temperature drift in the pick-up cables was designed to improve the control accuracy of the system. The new LLRF systems have passed a 24 h high power test on the HIRFL cavities. The phase stabilization control accuracy was |Δϕ|≤0.2 o , and the amplitude fluctuation was |ΔA|≤2∗10 −3 . Compared with the original analog system, the control precision and stability have been improved by an order of magnitude. The extraction beam energy of SFC was measured, and its stability is better than 4.3∗10 −3 , after this LLRF system is applied successfully. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver carcinoma and has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers. The γδ T cells could infiltrate HCC and have demonstrated potent tumor-killing capacity. Here, we found that in peripheral blood, the vast majority of γδ T cells were Vδ2 T cells. In HCC patients, the frequency of Vδ2 T cells was significantly lower than in controls. γδ T cells that were harvested directly ex vivo possessed very limited capacity to eliminate Zol-loaded HCC cell lines, even at a high effector to target ratio. In vitro expansion with Zol could significantly increase the capacity of γδ T cells to eliminate HCC cell lines. But even with in vitro expansion, the γδ T cells from HCC patients presented significantly lower cytotoxic capacity than the γδ T cells from healthy individuals. The expression of IL-2 and IL-21 by γδ T cells was significantly lower in HCC patients than in control volunteers. Supplementing recombinant human IL-2 and IL-21 in the in vitro expansion culture increased the cytotoxic capacity of γδ T cells. In addition, the frequency of PD-1 + γδ T cells was significantly higher in HCC patients than in controls ex vivo, and was significantly elevated after in vitro expansion. Hep3B and HepG2 did not express PD-L1, while a small fraction of SNU-398 expressed PD-L1. Interestingly, co-incubation with γδ T cell elevated PD-L1 expression in HCC cell lines. Blocking PD-1 during in vitro expansion stage significantly elevated cytotoxicity toward all the HCC cell lines, while blocking PD-1 during the cytotoxicity assay significantly elevated cytotoxicity toward HepG2 and SNU-398, but not toward Hep3B. Overall, these results demonstrated that the circulating γδ T cells in HCC patients were reduced in cytotoxic capacity, possibly associated with the lack of IL-2 and IL-21 production and PD-1 upregulation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Heavy metal contamination is widespread in Bangladesh. Previous studies have observed lead increases blood pressure over time. However, the role of other metal contaminants and essential micronutrients, which could also adversely affect blood pressure or act as protective factors, is understudied. Objectives: We therefore evaluated the associations of lead, manganese, and selenium with blood and pulse pressure trajectories. Methods: We prospectively followed placebo-assigned participants nested within a randomized trial for the prevention of arsenic-related skin cancer (n = 255). Blood lead, manganese, and selenium were measured at baseline; blood pressure was measured at baseline and at 3 biennial follow-up examinations. Mixed-effect linear regression models were used to estimate associations with average annual changes in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Results: In models simultaneously adjusted for baseline blood lead, manganese, and selenium concentrations in addition to other potential confounders, lead was linearly associated with increases in systolic blood pressure, but not with diastolic blood pressure or pulse pressure. A non-linear association was observed for manganese, such that mid-range concentrations were associated with decreases in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Baseline selenium concentrations in the highest quartile were also associated with longitudinal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while null associations were observed with pulse pressure. In exploratory analyses, the combination of mid-range manganese and high selenium concentrations completely offset lead-associated increases in blood and pulse pressure. Conclusions: The results indicate a direct, linear association of lead exposure with systolic blood pressure, and manganese and selenium exposures within certain ranges may have a blood pressure-lowering effect in this population. The findings of this study suggest toxic lead exposures remain a significant public health problem in Bangladesh where high levels are associated with high blood pressure; however, the nutritionally essential micronutrients manganese and selenium appear to confer protection from the hypertensive effects of lead. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Melanoma is one of the most common skin cancer that is characterized by rapid growth, early metastasis, high malignant, and mortality. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that promoter methylation of tumor-suppressor genes is implicated in the pathogenesis of melanoma. In the current study, we performed a meta-analysis to identify promising methylation biomarkers in the diagnosis of melanoma. We carried out a systematic literature search using Pubmed, Embase, and ISI web knowledge database and found that gene promoter methylation of 50 genes was reported to be associated with the risk of melanoma. Meta-analysis revealed that hypermethylation of claudin 11 (CLDN11; odds ratio [OR], 16.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.97–143.29; p = 0.010), O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT; OR, 5.59; 95% CI, 2.51–12.47; p < 0.0001), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16; OR, 6.57; 95% CI, 2.19–19.75; p = 0.0008), retinoic acid receptor β (RAR-β2; OR, 24.31; 95% CI, 4.58–129.01; p = 0.0002), and Ras association domain family member (RASSF1A; OR, 9.35; 95% CI, 4.73–18.45; p < 0.00001) was significantly higher in melanoma patients compared with controls. CLDN11 (OR, 14.52; 95% CI, 1.84–114.55; p = 0.01), MGMT (OR, 8.08; 95% CI, 1.84–35.46; p = 0.006), p16 (OR, 9.44; 95% CI, 2.68–33.29; p = 0.0005), and RASSF1A (OR, 7.72; 95% CI, 1.05–56.50; p = 0.04) hypermethylation was significantly increased in primary melanoma compared with controls. Methylation frequency of CLDN11 (OR, 25.56; 95% CI, 2.32–281.66; p = 0.008), MGMT (OR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.98–10.90; p = 0.0004), p16 (OR, 4.31; 95% CI, 1.33–13.96; p = 0.01), and RASSF1A (OR, 10.10; 95% CI, 2.87–35.54; p = 0.0003) was significantly higher in metastasis melanoma compared with controls. These findings indicated that CLDN11, MGMT, p16, RAR-β2, and RASSF1A hypermethylation is a risk factor and a potential biomarker for melanoma. CLDN11, MGMT, p16, and RASSF1A promoter methylation may take part in the development of melanoma and become useful biomarkers in the early diagnosis of the disease. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The solute transport distribution in a tumor is an important criterion in the evaluation of the cancer treatment efficacy. The fraction of killed cells after each treatment can quantify the therapeutic effect and plays as a helpful tool to evaluate the chemotherapy treatment schedules. In the present study, an image-based spatio-temporal computational model of a solid tumor is provided for calculation of interstitial fluid flow and solute transport. Current model incorporates heterogeneous microvasculature for angiogenesis instead of synthetic mathematical modeling. In this modeling process, a comprehensive model according to Convection-Diffusion-Reaction (CDR) equations is employed due to its high accuracy for simulating the binding and the uptake of the drug by tumor cells. Based on the velocity and the pressure distribution, transient distribution of the different drug concentrations (free, bound, and internalized) is calculated. Then, the fraction of killed cells is obtained according to the internalized concentration. Results indicate the dependence of the drug distribution on both time and space, as well as the microvasculature density. Free and bound drug concentration have the same trend over time, whereas, internalized and total drug concentration increases over time and reaches a constant value. The highest amount of concentration occurred in the tumor region due to the higher permeability of the blood vessels. Moreover, the fraction of killed cells is approximately 78.87% and 24.94% after treatment with doxorubicin for cancerous and normal tissues, respectively. In general, the presented methodology may be applied in the field of personalized medicine to optimize patient-specific treatments. Also, such image-based modeling of solid tumors can be used in laboratories that working on drug delivery and evaluating new drugs before using them for any in vivo or clinical studies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Younger children are referred for surgical intervention in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Outcome data in this population after a laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy and Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (LRS-IPAA) are limited. We reviewed our experience to determine if younger children would have similar functional outcomes. Methods: After institutional review board approval, a review of children with FAP and UC undergoing LRS-IPAA at a children's hospital from 2002 to 2017 occurred. The study groups were defined based on age: young group (YG; 5-12 y) and older group (OG; 13-18 y). Data points included demographics, postprocedure course, and outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: Sixty-five children were identified and grouped by age: YG (n = 22, average age 9 y) and OG (n = 43, average age 15.4 y). Thirteen children in YG had UC, and nine had FAP. Twenty-eight children in OG were diagnosed with UC, and 15 with FAP. After LRS-IPAA, continence, appetite recovery, and use of antidiarrheal medications were not significantly different between groups. The incidence of pouch stricture, diagnosis of pouchitis, and complications were also not significantly different. Two children (YG), aged 11 and 12 y at the time of colectomy, were initially diagnosed with UC and then reassigned as having Crohn's disease because of persistent symptoms. One child, who underwent colectomy at 17 y for FAP, had invasive rectal cancer and died 3 y later from metastatic disease. Time of follow-up for OG is 8-61 mo (average: 37 mo). Period of follow-up for YG is 11-73 mo (average: 43 mo). Conclusions: There are no significant differences in the functional outcomes between groups after LRS-IPAA. Although numbers are small, these data suggest younger age should not be a deterrent when contemplating LRS-IPAA in the treatment of UC and FAP in the pediatric population. Younger patients with FAP may benefit from early intervention. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The conjugation of diclofenac (DICLH), a Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID), with biocides such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and triphenylphosphine (TPP), through silver(I) ions, results into the chemical [Ag n (DICL) n (L) m ] k (L = DMSO and n = 2, m = 2, k = infinite (1); L = TPP and n = 1, m = 2, k = 1 (2)). The compounds were characterized by m.p., FT-IR, UV–vis and 1 H NMR spectroscopic techniques. The crystal and molecular structures of 1–2 were determined by X-ray crystallography. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of 1–2 against the human breast adenocarcinoma cancer cells MCF-7 (hormone dependent) and MDA-MB-231 (hormone independent) reveals that the 1 inhibits the MCF-7 rather than the MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting hormone mimetic behaviour. Compound 2 inhibits both cancerous cell lines, stronger than cisplatin. Both compounds inhibit MCF-7 cells migration. Compounds 1–2, exhibit, lower toxicity against fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells than cisplatin. Their genotoxicity was evaluated on MRC-5 cells. The molecular mechanism of 1–2 against MCF-7 cells was clarified by (i) their cell cycle arrest study (ii) their mitochondrial membrane permeability (iii) their binding affinity towards Calf Thymus (CT)-DNA and (iv) their inhibitory activity against the enzyme lipoxygenase (LOX). Regression analysis of the data obtained for [Ag(NSAID)(Ar 3 P) m ] (NSAID = p‑hydroxy‑benzoic acid (p-HO-BZAH), salicylic acid (SALH 2 ), aspirin (ASPH), naproxen (NAPRH), nimesulide (NIMH); L = TPP, Tri(p‑tolyl)phosphine (TPTP), Tri(o‑tolyl)phosphine (TOTP), Tri(m‑tolyl)phosphine (TMTP); m = 2 or 3) and [Ag(DICL) 2 (DMSO) 2 ] k (k = infinite) was performed. Considering the biological results (IC 50 ) as dependent variable a theoretical equation is obtained for these compounds. The calculated IC 50 values are compared satisfactorily with the corresponding experimental inhibitory activity of the complexes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: In recent decades‎ ‎radiotherapy has became one of the most useful and cost effective tools in cancer treatment‎. Having a number of unique characteristics made gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as promising candidates in achieving dose enhancement in tumor and improving the radiation treatment outcome‎. ‎Considering the widely documented tendency of GNPs to localize around the nucleus‎ ‎the distribution model of GNPs in the medium needs to be investigated in detail and to be well quantified‎. Methods: The MCNPX Monte Carlo code was used to simulate particle transport in cells‎. ‎A single cell‎ ‎including an ellipsoidal cytoplasm with a centrally located sphere surrounded by a cube as the medium was modeled‎. ‎The physical dose due to the irradiation of 10–100 keV monoenergetic photons was calculated in the nucleus‎. To investigate the effect of the approach used for distribution of GNPs in the medium on dose enhancement factor‎ (‎DEF)‎ three models have been proposed‎: ‎filling the medium and the cytoplasm with either a gold-water mixture or a homogeneously distributed GNPs‎ ‎and the heterogeneous model by simulating spheres of GNPs localized in the cytoplasm‎. Results: The results show an overestimation of dose enhancement caused by gold-water mixture rather than that of homogeneous distribution‎. The DEFs for the heterogeneous model‎ ‎while follow the same behavior of two other models against various primary energies‎ ‎quantitatively demonstrate a significant distinction‎. ‎This model was also examined by studying the effect of concentration (the ratio of the mass of GNPs to the mass of the medium)‎ ‎size and density of‎ GNPs on nucleus dose enhancement‎. ‎It was found that though the values calculated for DEF strongly depend on concentration of GNPs‎ ‎for a given concentration‎ ‎they would not considerably be affected by changing the GNPs’ size‎. As a criterion to assess their density around the nucleus‎ ‎the distance between two typical GNPs was found to be a key determinant factor to predict and to control dose enhancement in the target volume‎. For the primary photons of 30 keV‎ ‎our results showed a negligible difference between the DEFs calculated due to the cell orientation in the medium‎. ‎By extending the heterogeneous model for ten different locations of nucleus in the cell‎ ‎the energy dependence behavior of DEF was observed‎. Conclusions: The results obtained emphasize the importance of accurate modeling of the distribution of GNPs in cell to demonstrate the more precise potential of gold in improving radiotherapy treatments‎. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "A novel nanocomposite of rGO@CD@Au was prepared by a hydrothermal method. Microscopic techniques and various spectroscopic were used to characterize the nanocomposites. Under a suitable reaction condition, uniform Au nanoparticles on the reduced graphene oxide sheets could be selectively synthesized, which showed the best surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) activity among all samples. Cell experiments indicated the as-prepared rGO@Au@CD possessed better biocompatibility than the corresponding rGO@CD@Ag or rGO@Au. DOX, a widely used anti-cancer drug, could be detected at low concentration using this nanocomposite as SERS substrate. The present study provided an ideal drug monitoring system for malignant cancer therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "An extensive investigation on spatial distribution and environmental risk assessment based on total content and fractions of heavy metals, as well as the cancer risk of Cd from seven adjacent contaminated paddy fields at Xiangtan City, southern China, was conducted in this study. A total of 63 soil samples were analyzed for soil physical properties and concentrations of eight heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn). The results showed that concentrations of metals except for Cr, Mn and Ni exceeded the background values to varying degrees, and particularly, content of Cd was as 57.4–612 times higher than background values. Principal components analysis and correlation analysis revealed three groups: industry activities for Cd and Zn; natural sources mainly for Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr, with some slight anthropogenic activities for Cu and Pb accumulation; and manganese ore associated with cobalt for Co and Mn. Combined with different indices, Cd and Zn were the major contributors to the ecological risk, and cancer risk of Cd indicated an unacceptable degree in this area. Altogether, results from this study will facilitate a better understanding of metals distribution characteristics and provide a scientific basis for further comprehensive management for these paddy fields. Combination of functional microbial agent and plants promises to be a feasible and effective remediation method for cadmium pollution in the study area. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Daily PM2.5 was collected in the periods before, during and after the Chinese Spring Festival (CSF) in both 2016 and 2018 to clarify the annual variation in the concentrations and health risks of toxic metals under different firework/firecracker (FF) management strategies. PM2.5 and bound metals all decreased during the CSF from 2016 to 2018. According to relative abundance analysis, toxic metals, i.e., Ba, Pb, Cu and Cr, showed obvious peak concentrations and abundance levels on intensive FF burning days, i.e., New Year's Eve, Chinese New Year and the Lunar Festival. In both CSF periods, three sources of toxic metals, namely, FF burning, coal combustion, and resuspended dust and vehicle emissions, were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF). Among them, the mass contribution of FF decreased from 0.83 μg m−3 (11%) in the 2016 CSF to 0.23 μg m−3 (9.0%) in the 2018 CSF. The FF-attributed noncancer and cancer risks due to metals for residents under long-term exposure were 0.02 (19.9%) and 1.76 × 10−7 (17.9%) in the 2016 CSF and 0.01 (20.2%) and 8.59 × 10−8 (14.7%) in the 2018 CSF. Although a policy shift from “restriction” to “prohibition” regarding FF has indeed decreased toxic metal concentrations and health risk, Cr(VI) and Ba should be examined more closely in the future because they have become dominant contributors to cancer risk and noncancer risk, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor-targeted core-shell nanoparticles were developed for a multifunctional drug delivery system (DDS) for cancer therapy. Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles with mesoporous silica (Fe 3 O 4 NPs@mSiO 2 ), in which Fe 3 O 4 and mSiO 2 form the core and shell, respectively, were functionalized to deliver a hydrophobic anti-tumor drug and to heat targeted tumor cells with the energy of an alternating magnetic field. For targeting tumor cells, tLyP-1, a tumor cell homing and penetrating peptide, was engrafted on to the Fe 3 O 4 NPs@mSiO 2 (Fe 3 O 4 NPs@mSiO 2 -tLyP-1). The fabricated Fe 3 O 4 NPs@mSiO 2 -tLyP-1 were loaded with camptothecin (CPT); they showed robust, selective targeting and penetrating efficacy for Hela cells, and induced cell death. The CPT-loaded Fe 3 O 4 NPs@mSiO 2 -tLyP-1 (Fe 3 O 4 NPs@mSiO 2 -tLyP-1(CPT)) reduced the cell viability of Hela cells to 28.8%. Furthermore, in combination with application of an alternating magnetic field to cause hyperthermia, the nanoparticles made it possible to decrease viability to 18.3%. The systemic toxicity of Fe 3 O 4 NPs@mSiO 2 -tLyP-1(CPT) to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was minimal, because the nanoparticles selectively targeted and penetrated the tumor cells. This study indicates that the developed Fe 3 O 4 NPs@mSiO 2 -tLyP-1 have potential as a DDS in the chemo-hyperthermic treatment of cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Diesel engine exhaust (DEE), which is the product of diesel combustion, is considered carcinogenic in humans. It comprises toxic gases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and particulate matter which can reach the pulmonary parenchyma and trigger various diseases, including cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of DEE exposure on peripheral blood and buccal epithelial cells in mechanics occupationally exposed to DEE. We recruited 120 exposed mechanics and 100 non-exposed control individuals. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of percentage of tail DNA and damage index (DI) in the alkaline comet assay; levels of biomarkers by cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay; frequency of micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB), nuclear bud (NBUD) and apoptotic cells (APOP) and levels of biomarkers for micronucleus, karyorrhexis (KRX), karyolysis (KRL) and condensed chromatin (CC) by the buccal micronucleus cytome (BM-Cyt) assay. A significant and positive correlation was found between the frequency of MN in lymphocytes and buccal cells in the exposed group. Also, there was a significant correlation between age and percentage of tail DNA and DI in the comet assay, APOP and MN in the CBMN-Cyt assay and NBUD and MN in the BM-Cyt assay. Additionally, we found a positive and significant correlation of MN frequency in lymphocytes and buccal cells and age and MN frequency in lymphocytes with the time of service (years). Regarding lifestyle-related factors, a significant correlation was observed between meat and vitamin consumption and NBUD formation on CBMN-Cyt and between meat consumption and MN formation on CBMN-Cyt. Of the BM-Cyt biomarkers, there was a correlation between alcohol consumption and NBUD formation and between binucleated cell (BN), pyknosis (PYC), CC and KRL occurrence and family cancer history. These results are the first data in Colombia on the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects induced by continuous exposure to DEE and thus showed the usefulness of biomarkers of the comet, CBMN-Cyt and BM-Cyt assays for human biomonitoring and evaluation of cancer risk in the exposed populations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Phenolic derivatives are compounds used in the production of pesticides, pharmaceutical products and several other industrial applications. These compounds are discharged into freshwater from industrial effluents, domestic sewage, urban and agricultural run-offs which leads to pollution. Water at six sampling locations along the course of Buffalo River; namely Buffalo river estuary (BRE), Mdantsane (MSN), Zwelitsha (ZW), King William's Town (KWT), Izele Town (IZ) and Maden dam (MD) in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were evaluated for phenolic contamination using eleven phenolic derivatives of United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) priority pollutants. Samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction technique, derivatized with acetic anhydride and analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The levels of the individual pollutants in the river water were higher in summer (&lt; LOD to 12246 ng/L) than in autumn (&lt; LOD to 713 ng/L). Their concentrations were found higher than the USEPA recommended limit (500 ng/L) in most of the sampling sites. The most prominent pollutant was 2-NP. However, the cancer risk assessment values and hazard quotient were below USEPA maximum limits of 10 −6 and 1, respectively. Conclusively, the concentrations of these organic pollutants could be a threat to public health and should be managed to be below the recommended limit though the present levels are unlikely to cause cancer to both human and wildlife. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Increasing evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to tumorigenesis, progression and recurrence of various malignancies including Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Lnc-DILC is reported to be the tumor suppressor gene to play an important role in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the role of lnc-DILC in GBC remains to be elucidated. Herein, we show that lnc-DILC is upregulated in gallbladder CSCs and GBC patients’ tissues. Knockdown of lnc-DILC attenuates the self-renewal, tumorigenicity, proliferation and metastasis of gallbladder CSCs. Mechanistically, lnc-DILC promotes gallbladder CSCs expansion via Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Special Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor FH535 diminishes the discrepancy of self-renewal, growth and metastasis between lnc-DILC interference GBC cells and their control cells. In conclusion, lnc-DILC drives gallbladder CSCs self-renewal, tumorigenicity, proliferation and metastasis by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and may therefore prove to be a potential therapeutic target for GBC patients. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "We constructed a novel stimuli-responsive system, MSNPs 1, based on mechanized silica nanoparticles, in which mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) acted as nanocontainers to load cargo, and supramolecular switches consisting of hydrazone bond, azobenzene and α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) realized the controlled release of cargo molecules from MSNPs 1. In neutral solution and without UV light irradiation, the azobenzene component on functional stalks was in trans form, and combined with α-CD to block the mesoporous channels and prevent the cargo from escaping. Upon adjusting the solution pH to acid range, the acid-sensitive hydrazone bonds rapidly hydrolyzed, resulting in the disconnection between pseudorotaxanes and MSNs. The encapsulated cargo molecules were released simultaneously from MSNPs 1 due to the removal of supramolecular switches. On the other hand, when the neutral solution was irradiated with UV light at 365 nm, trans-azobenzene converted to cis, disassociating with α-CD to activate the switches and release the cargo. The unique acid- and light-triggered controlled release properties of MSNPs 1 have potential application in various fields. In this manuscript, doxorubicin (DOX) was selected to be stored in MSNPs 1, due to the anticancer property. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells could phagocytose DOX-loaded MSNPs 1 easily, and the released DOX showed the killing effect. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common female reproductive system tumors. In this study, we explored the clinical significance of Histone demethylase KDM5B gene and its effects on paclitaxel (PTX) sensitivity in EC. Method: First, we found that KDM5B expression significantly higher in EC tissues and cell lines. The elevated KDM5B expression was associated with high pathological grade and low PTX sensitivity. The functional role of KDM5B in PTX-resistant Ishikawa-R and HEC1A-R cells were examined by gene silencing experiments. Results: Knockdown of KDM5B resulted in the re-sensitization towards paclitaxel in both resistant cell lines. In addition, we also identified that microRNA-29c-3p (a tumor suppressor) was significantly lower in the EC cells and linked to the low PTX sensitivity of EC. The up-regulation of miR-29c-3p using exogenous mimic molecules markedly increased PTX sensitivity in both cell lines and reduced expression of KDM5B while the inhibitor of miR-29-3p resulted in the opposite effects. Notably, we also demonstrated that the level of miR-29c-3p was inversely correlated to the invasive, colony-forming abilities and PTX resistance in both cell lines. We also identified that miR-29c-3p has a binding site in the 3′UTR of the KDM5B gene, establishing a link of this signaling axis. In conclusion, high-expression of KDM5B is associated with the poor response to PTX in EC patients. Silencing of KDM5B led to the reversal of PTX resistance through miR-29c-3p/KDM5B pathway in EC. Conclusion: Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which EC cells acquire paclitaxel resistance and potential this signaling as a theronostic marker for this malignancy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The BCR-ABL1 oncogene is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) pathogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms that initiate leukemogenesis are still unclear. Cancer pathogenesis has been associated with genetic alterations that may lead to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently deleted or inactivated in various tumors. A recently discovered variant of PTEN, PTEN-Long (PTEN-L), results from an alternative translation initiation site located upstream of the canonic AUG and generates a protein of 576 amino acids instead the expected protein of 403 amino acids. A 16 bp perfect palindromic motif centered on the PTEN-L CUG 513 start codon is required for translation initiation. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of PTEN-L gene rs12573787 is located on the first exon respect to the CUG initiation site. In this case-control study we evaluated the association of genetic variants in PTEN-L with CML risk and therapy response in the Argentine population. The allele A of SNP rs12573787 was found to be associated with CML risk OR (95% CI) 1.71 (1.11–2.63) p = 0.016, which resulted consistent by multivariate analysis adjusted by gender and age. According to previous evidence that CML is more frequent in males, we found that the genetic risk of CML was confined to this gender. Unexpectedly, we also found this association confined to CML patients older than 45 years old. To our knowledge, this is the first time that PTEN-L rs1257378 was studied in CML suggesting that the variant A allele is a risk factor for CML development but, no association with the failure to TKIs treatment was found. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Photolysis and microbial activity are relatively obvious in shallow, eutrophic waters with low dissolved oxygen content. Ubiquitous humic acid (HA) can act as electron acceptor and be reduced by bacterial under such conditions, and the reduced form of humic acid (RHA) plays an important role in the photolysis contaminants. In this study, anaerobic 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) photodegradation was performed along with biodegradation by Shewanella putrefaciens mediated by HA. The mechanism of such coupled photolysis and biodegradation of EE2 was thus elucidated. The removal rate in such coupled degradation in the presence of 10 mgC L−1 of HA at pH 8.0 was greater than that of either photolysis or biodegradation alone. HA which had been reduced in a double-chamber microbial fuel cell showed better promotion to EE2 photodegradation than fresh HA. Reactive species scavenging experiments indicated that hydroxyl radical and excited triplet states of HA were primary contributors to EE2 photodegradation in anaerobic conditions. More of them were produced from RHA than from pristine HA. Besides, the degraded EE2 solutions inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 human cancer Cells. These findings improve our understanding of the environmental transformation of EE2 in the shallow, anoxic waters. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Enrichment of potentially harmful elements in surface water results in ecological risk to the surrounding environment. Assessing the environmental risk of these elements is of great importance. In this study, surface water samples from 6 different subsidence water bodies in the Huainan coal mining area were collected. The concentrations of Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Co, Cr, V, Fe, Mn and Zn were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and those of As and Hg were analyzed by atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Then, human health risks through the ingestion and dermal contact pathways were assessed and analyzed on the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation. The mean and 95th percentile risks were reported. The results showed that the total carcinogenic risk values in every subsidence water body summed for Cr, Ni and As via two exposure pathways were greater than the maximum acceptable level (1 × 10−4), and Xinji'er water body had the highest carcinogenic risk. Among three elements, Ni was the highest contributor to carcinogenic risk. All non-carcinogenic health risk (hazard quotients) values except for one water area of Co (Xinji'er) were less than 1; however, the total non-carcinogenic health risks of two water bodies (Xinji'er, Xinjiyi) summed for all the elements based on mean concentrations were higher than 1. Xinji'er had the highest hazard index. The extent of the impacts of the total hazard quotients followed the order of Co &gt; As &gt; Cd &gt; Hg &gt; Pb &gt; V &gt;Fe &gt; Ni &gt; Mn &gt; Zn &gt; Cr. Furthermore, the total hazard quotients of Co and As via ingestion pathway summed for the six subsidence water areas were greater than 1, which should be a concern. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Globally, prostate cancer remains a challenging health burden for men as it is the second leading cause of cancer death in men and about one in nine will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. Enhanced expression of COX-2 and Glut-1 proteins are reported as major factors leading to the origin and progress of prostate cancer through modulating the associated signaling pathways. In this study, we have synthesized a multifunctional liposomal system containing celecoxib and genistein drugs. The combinatorial effect of these drugs leads to the selectively induce the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells than normal fibroblast cells. The mechanistic study suggests that enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and a decrease in cellular GSH concentration, along with inhibition of COX-2 synthesis and Glut-1 receptors are the key processes behind the inhibition of prostate cancer cells. Overall, these results provide strong evidence for the role of COX-2 and Glut-1 proteins for the progression of prostate cancer and highlighting the potential of celecoxib and genistein as a useful and combinatorial pharmacological agent for chemotherapeutic purposes in prostate cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), has limited treatment options. We repurposed the FDA-approved drug bazedoxifene as a novel inhibitor of interleukin 6/glycoprotein 130 signaling. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of bazedoxifene alone or in combination with paclitaxel on several estrogen receptor positive and TNBC cells. Bazedoxifene inhibited the cell viability of these cells, as well as tumor growth of TNBC cells in a xenograft tumor model. Furthermore, bazedoxifene combined with paclitaxel exhibited more potent inhibition of cell viability, colony formation, and cell migration and induced more apoptosis in vitro, and generated stronger inhibition of tumor growth of TNBC in vivo than either drug alone. Western blotting showed that bazedoxifene inhibited estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells by suppressing the expression of estrogen receptor, Cyclin D1, p-P70S6K, Survivin, c-Myc, and Bcl-2, and bazedoxifene inhibited TNBC cells by inhibiting the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) , Cyclin D1, p-P70S6K, c-Myc, p-AKT (Ser473) and p-ERK 1/2 (T202/Y 204) without changing the expression of total STAT3. When combined with paclitaxel, bazedoxifene may be a potential small molecule for the treatment of both estrogen receptor positive and triple-negative breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "SARI (suppressor of activator protein 1, regulated by IFN) functions as a tumour suppressor and is inactivated in various cancers. However, the mechanism underlying SARI inactivation in cancer remains elusive. In this study, we detected a high level of DNA methylation of the SARI promoter and an inverse correlation between SARI promoter methylation and expression in malignant tissues from patients with colon cancer. Furthermore, we found that the SARI promoter methylation status is a prognostic indicator for patients with colon cancer. A dCas9-multiGCN4/scFv-TET1CD-sgRNA-based SARI-targeted demethylation system (dCas9-multiGCN4/scFv-TET1CD-sgSARI) was constructed to precisely and specifically demethylate regions of SARI; this system resulted in the substantial activation of SARI expression. Further in vitro and in vivo data confirmed that dCas9-multiGCN4/scFv-TET1CD-sgSARI exerts anti-tumour effects by regulating tumour proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Collectively, specific demethylation of the SARI promoter and restoration of endogenous SARI expression by dCas9-multiGCN4/scFv-TET1CD-SARI have therapeutic applications for colon cancer and perhaps for other cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Upregulation of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1) has been suggested to promote tumor growth and metastasis. However, the factors governing its cellular levels remain unclear. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 47 (USP47), a member of the deubiquitinating enzymes family, interacts with SATB1 and mediates its deubiquitination and stability. USP47 deficiency impairs transcriptional activity of SATB1 target genes and inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, and tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colon cancer. Furthermore, we identified SMURF2 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes SATB1 degradation by upregulating its ubiquitination, and its deficiency promotes colon cancer cell proliferation and SATB1 target gene transcription. SMURF2 is negatively regulated by USP47, and USP47 depletion sensitizes colon cancer cells to 5-FU treatment-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings provide a ubiquitination-related mechanistic link to USP47, SMURF2, and SATB1 and suggest that USP47 might be targeted for colon cancer treatment when SATB1 is overexpressed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This study identified LIMK2 kinase as a disease-specific target in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) pathogenesis, which is upregulated in response to androgen deprivation therapy, the current standard of treatment for prostate cancer. Surgical castration increases LIMK2 expression in mouse prostates due to increased hypoxia. Similarly, human clinical specimens showed highest LIMK2 levels in CRPC tissues compared to other stages, while minimal LIMK2 was observed in normal prostates. Most notably, inducible knockdown of LIMK2 fully reverses CRPC tumorigenesis in castrated mice, underscoring its potential as a clinical target for CRPC. We also identified TWIST1 as a direct substrate of LIMK2, which uncovered the molecular mechanism of LIMK2-induced malignancy. TWIST1 is strongly associated with CRPC initiation, progression and poor prognosis. LIMK2 increases TWIST1 mRNA levels upon hypoxia; and stabilizes TWIST1 by direct phosphorylation. TWIST1 also stabilizes LIMK2 by inhibiting its ubiquitylation. Phosphorylation-dead TWIST1 acts as dominant negative and fully prevents EMT and tumor formation in vivo, thereby highlighting the significance of LIMK2-TWIST1 signaling axis in CRPC. As LIMK2 null mice are viable, targeting LIMK2 should have minimal collateral toxicity, thereby improving the overall survival of CRPC patients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "JunD, a member of the AP-1 family, is essential for cell proliferation in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We recently demonstrated that JunD knock-down (KD) in PCa cells results in cell cycle arrest in G 1 -phase concomitant with a decrease in cyclin D1, Ki67, and c-MYC, but an increase in p21 levels. Furthermore, the over-expression of JunD significantly increased proliferation suggesting JunD regulation of genes required for cell cycle progression. Here, employing gene expression profiling, quantitative proteomics, and validation approaches, we demonstrate that JunD KD is associated with distinct gene and protein expression patterns. Comparative integrative analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified 1) cell cycle control/regulation as the top canonical pathway whose members exhibited a significant decrease in their expression following JunD KD including PRDX3, PEA15, KIF2C, and CDK2, and 2) JunD dependent genes are associated with cell proliferation, with MYC as the critical downstream regulator. Conversely, JunD over-expression induced the expression of the above genes including c-MYC. We conclude that JunD is a crucial regulator of cell cycle progression and inhibiting its target genes may be an effective approach to block prostate carcinogenesis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Activated Akt and ERK signaling pathways are closely related to breast cancer progression, and Akt or ERK inhibition induces cell senescence. However, the crosstalk between the Akt and ERK signaling pathways in cell senescence and how to simultaneously suppress Akt and ERK signaling in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are undefined. In this study, we found that norcantharidin (NCTD) effectively induced cell senescence and cell cycle arrest in TNBC in vitro, which was accompanied by a decline in phosphorylated Akt and ERK1/2 and a rise in p21 and p16. The inhibitors LY294002 and U0126 imitated the effect of NCTD when these two inhibitors were combined regardless of crosstalk between these two signaling pathways. In addition, NCTD inhibited the growth of xenografts via downregulation of phosphorylated Akt and ERK1/2 and upregulation of p21 in vivo. However, NCTD upregulated the level of soluble signaling factors of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in a NF-κB-independent manner. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that NCTD induced cell senescence and cell cycle arrest mainly by simultaneously blocking Akt and ERK signaling in TNBC, suggesting that NCTD may be used as a potential adjuvant therapy in TNBC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "3,3’-Diindolymethane (DIM) is a dimeric condensation product of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) that is found in broccoli and cabbage. Although DIM has been reported to exhibit anticancer properties against multiple tumor types, the direct target proteins of DIM have not been fully investigated. In the present study, we report that DIM is a novel COX1/2 and ERK1/2 inhibitor that suppresses growth of colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. To identify possible molecular targets of DIM, 11 potential candidate proteins were validated by an in vitro kinase or enzyme assay. We found that DIM directly inhibits COX1/2 and ERK1/2 protein activities in vitro. Additionally, the PGE2 production (COX-mediated metabolite) and phosphorylated RSK expression (ERK1/2 direct downstream kinase) were strongly suppressed by DIM in colon cancer cells. The inhibition of cell growth by DIM is dependent on the expression of COX1/2 or ERK1/2 proteins. Notably, oral administration of DIM suppressed patient-derived xenograft colon tumor growth in an in vivo mouse model. Overall these results suggest that DIM is a potent and dual COX1/2 and ERK1/2 inhibitor that might be used for chemotherapy against colon cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Snail is an important transcription factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and related to poor prognosis and distant metastasis of tumor patients. Snail is a liable protein and degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome system. There are various E3 ligases mediating its degradation, but the deubiquitinating enzyme reversed Snail degradation is not fully understood. In this study, we screened a DUB library and found USP26 is a potent deubiquitinase mediating Snail stabilization. We also identified that USP26 is a booster of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell migration and invasion, and it is highly expressed in ESCC samples. Our observation demonstrates that USP26 is a novel deubiquitinating enzyme of Snail and it provides a potential target for the therapy of esophageal cancer metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce cell death in cancer cells by triggering an acute proteotoxic stress response characterized by accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, ER stress and the production of reactive oxygen species. The aggresome pathway has been described as an escape mechanism from proteotoxicity by sequestering toxic cellular aggregates. Here we show that b-AP15, a small-molecule inhibitor of proteasomal deubiquitinase activity, induces poly-ubiquitin accumulation in absence of aggresome formation. b-AP15 was found to affect organelle transport in treated cells, raising the possibility that microtubule-transport of toxic protein aggregates is inhibited, leading to enhanced cytotoxicity. In contrast to the antiproliferative effects of the clinically used proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the effects of b-AP15 are not further enhanced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Our results suggest an inhibitory effect of b-AP15 on the transport of misfolded proteins, resulting in a lack of aggresome formation, and a strong proteotoxic stress response. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Shellfish consumption is an important pathway for coastal residents exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) and methylmercury (MeHg). An integrated method had been developed for simultaneous determination of iAs and MeHg in shellfish with microwave-assisted extraction and high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry identification. The limits of detection were 0.0520, 0.1003 and 0.0015 mg/kg (dry weight) for As III , As V and MeHg, respectively. The proposed method was applied to evaluate the contents and health risks of iAs and MeHg in shellfish from the typical coastal cities (Lianyungang and Yantai) in China. The concentrations of iAs and MeHg in fresh shellfish were 0.10–1.69 mg/kg and 0.46–6.38 μg/kg, respectively. The target hazard quotient and target cancer risk values of iAs were the highest for the children and adults in Lianyungang, and were respectively larger than 1 and 1 × 10 −4 , indicating both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of iAs exposure were significant in this area. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ze-Qi-Tang (ZQT), a classic Chinese herbal formula, has been for over thousand years used for the treatment of several respiratory ailments like cough, asthma, hydrothorax and lung cancer. Aim of study: Cumulative literature on ZQT herbal formula reveals that its several constituent components are potent inducer of apoptosis in different cancer cells. However, the activity of ZQT against non-small-cell-lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been previously examined. The aim of the study is to investigate the molecular mechanism of ZQT on NSCLC cells. Materials and methods: Cell growth were determined by CCK-8 and colony formation assay. Induction of cellular apoptosis or arrest of cell cycle were determined by flow cytometric analysis using annexin V/ propidium iodide, Hoechst 33342 or TUNEL staining method. In some assay p53 activity of NSCLC (A549 and H460) cells were blocked with pifithrin-a, prior to treatment with ZQT. The level of expression of cell cycle and apoptosis related marker proteins were estimated by western blot. The anticancer activity of ZQT in vivo were monitored in nude mice that were induced with tumor by subcutaneous inoculation of A549 cells and then treated by ZQT(100 mg/kg,200 mg/kg,400 mg/kg) gavaging for 30 days. Mice’ body weight and tumor volume were measured weekly. The survival carve was recorded. Apoptosis from mice’ tissue was observed by TUNEL assay. Pathological histology of liver, kidney and heart were detected by H&E staining, and its functions were tested by ELISA. Results: Dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation of NSCLC (A549 and H460) cells by ZQT therapy along with induction of cell cycle arrest at G0⁄G1 phase were observed. The arrest of cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cellular proliferation were associated with up regulation of p53 along with down regulation of Cyclin B1 and Cdk2 indicating a mitochondrial related induction of apoptosis with ZQT. A reversal of ZQT-induced apoptosis and G0⁄G1 arrest was observed with pifithrin-a pretreatment. ZQT was also found to suppress the progression of tumor growth in mouse xenograft models and prolong survival. In addition, no hepato- or nephro- or cardio-toxicity with ZQT treatment were detected in mice. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the ZQT formula inhibits the growth of NSCLC cells and is a potential agent of complementary and alternative treatment for lung cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Treatment of cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is challenging in clinics. Oxycodone is used to treat CIBP. However, the lack of understanding of the mechanism of CIBP limits the application of oxycodone. In this study, proteomic profiling of oxycodone-treated spinal dorsal cord of rats with CIBP was performed. Briefly, a total of 3519 proteins were identified in the Sham group; 3505 proteins in the CIBP group; and 3530 proteins in the CIBP-OXY treatment group. The 2-fold cut-off value was used as the differential protein standard for abundance reduction or increase (p < 0.05). Significant differences were found in the abundance of 16 proteins between Sham and CIBP group; 11 proteins in the CIBP group had increased abundance while 5 proteins had reduced abundance. Furthermore, fifteen proteins with differential abundance were identified between the CIBP group and the OXY group. Compared with the CIBP group, there were six increased abundances and nine reduced abundances in the OXY group. In addition, a reduced expression of ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 binding factor 1 (Arl6ip-1), an endoplasmic reticulum protein that has an important role in cell conduction and material transport, was found in the CIBP group compared with the Sham group. Its expression increased after the administration of OXY. Proteomics results were further verified by Western-blot. Fluorescent staining revealed that Arl6ip-1 co-localized with spinal dorsal horn neurons, but not with astrocytes or microglia. Based on the observed results, we believe that Arl6ip-1 may be a potential drug target for OXY treatment of CIBP rats. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity can be a dose-limiting side effect to effective chemotherapy. Acute hyperexcitability causes cold-evoked sensory and motor symptoms, which resemble neuromyotonia. An accessible and non-invasive technique for early detection could help select patients for potential treatments. We assessed the use of a simple surface electromyography (sEMG) in patients directly after oxaliplatin infusion. Methods:In patients with colorectal cancer, acute neurotoxicity was evaluated by means of a physical examination, a questionnaire, and sEMG directly after the second and fourth cycle of oxaliplatin. Questionnaires were also assessed 1 day after infusion. Results: 14 patients were measured after the second cycle and 8 patients were also measured after the fourth cycle of oxaliplatin. All patients reported to a variable degree oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity symptoms: sensitivity to touching cold or swallowing cold items were reported as most severe. Clinical signs of hyperexcitability were observed in 55% of the measurements. Spontaneous activity compatible with neuromyotonia was observed in 82% of the sEMG recordings. Conclusions: Patient reported symptoms, physical examination and simple sEMG are complementary measurements to detect acute oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity. After further validation, sEMG recording can be used as a simple objective screenings tool to detect nerve hyperexcitability directly after oxaliplatin administration. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "The neurosphere assay is a powerful in vitro system for studying stem/progenitor-cell-driven tissue growth. By employing a stochastic cellular automata model, we simulated the development of tumorous neurospheres in response to transformation of a randomly selected progenitor cell into a brain tumor stem cell. Simulated tumorous neurospheres were distinguished from normal neurospheres by their size, which exceeded that of normal neurospheres typically manifold. A decisive factor that determined whether brain tumor stem cells gave rise to tumorous neurospheres was their ability to escape encapsulation by neighboring cells, which suppressed mitotic activity through contact inhibition. In our simulations, the likelihood of tumorigenesis was strongly negatively correlated with the developmental maturity of the neurospheres in which the transformation of a progenitor cell into a brain tumor stem cell was induced. This likelihood was furthermore modulated by the probability of the progeny of dividing cells to undergo cell death. In developmentally immature neurospheres, the number of normal neurospheres, relative to the number of tumorous neurospheres, increased with increasing cell death probability. Markedly, in developmentally mature neurospheres the opposite effect was observed. This dichotomous effect of cell death on simulated tumor progression provides theoretical support for the seemingly paradoxical finding made by other authors in experimental studies that anti-cancer therapies based on induction of apoptosis may both promote and suppress tumor growth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Epigenetics is coming to the fore as a key process which underpins health. In particular emerging experimental evidence has associated alterations to DNA methylation status with healthspan and aging. Mammalian DNA methylation status is maintained by an intricate array of biochemical and molecular processes. It can be argued changes to these fundamental cellular processes ultimately drive the formation of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, which are a hallmark of diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. In recent years mathematical models have been used as effective tools to help advance our understanding of the dynamics which underpin DNA methylation. In this paper we present linear and nonlinear models which encapsulate the dynamics of the molecular mechanisms which define DNA methylation. Applying a recently developed Bayesian algorithm for parameter estimation and model selection, we are able to estimate distributions of parameters which include nominal parameter values. Using limited noisy observations, the method also identified which methylation model the observations originated from, signaling that our method has practical applications in identifying what models best match the biological data for DNA methylation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "TPA is considered to be a tumor promoting molecule that induces the expression of COX-2 protein. However, it is contradictory to find that TPA can induce tumor cell apoptosis and exert antitumor activity. Therefore, the role of TPA in tumorigenesis and development has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that TPA can promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cells and increase the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. It is suggested that TPA may induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells through mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Further studies showed that TPA could cause mitochondrial dysfunction and trigger mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In mechanism, the mitochondrial targeting of TR3 is involved in TPA induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TPA can play a role in inhibiting cancer by inducing apoptosis and TR3 is expected to be a new target for cancer treatment. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Ajuba dysregulation has been reported in several human cancers. However, its expression patterns and biological roles in human gastric cancers have not yet been characterized. In the current study, we found that Ajuba protein was increased in gastric cancer tissues and in cell lines. High Ajuba expression positively correlated with the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine microarray data mining also suggested that Ajuba mRNA upregulation in gastric cancer tissues. We used SGC-7901 and NCI-N87 cell lines for Ajuba overexpression and siRNA knockdown respectively. MTT and colony formation assays indicated that Ajuba overexpression increased proliferation rate and colony formation ability while Ajuba siRNA inhibited proliferation rate and colony formation ability. AnnexinV and JC1 staining showed that Ajuba downregulated cisplatin induced apoptosis while it upregulated mitochondrial membrane potential. Ajuba overexpression also inhibited caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, while Ajuba depletion showed the opposite effects. Notably, Ajuba enhanced glucose metabolism by upregulating glucose uptake, glucose consumption, lactate production and ATP production. We further revealed that Ajuba positively regulated cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and GLUT1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Analysis of TCGA dataset revealed that there were positive correlations between Ajuba and cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, GLUT1 at the mRNA levels. Further investigation demonstrated that Ajuba overexpression inhibited Hippo signaling by upregulating YAP protein expression. Depletion of YAP by siRNA abolished the effect of Ajuba on cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and GLUT1. Together, our study showed that Ajuba was overexpressed in human gastric cancers, where it increased cell growth and chemoresistance. Our data also identified novel roles of Ajuba in gastric cancer progression involving regulating glucose uptake and mitochondrial function through the YAP-GLUT1/Bcl-xL axis, making it a potential therapeutic target. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in carcinogenesis. It is necessary to uncover the detailed pattern of comprehensive lncRNA expression in the genome during the development of gastric cancer (GC). We implemented lncRNA microarray analysis in 5 paired GC tissues to detect the lncRNA expression profile. Moreover, we set out to explore the biological function, clinical application and molecular basis of the aberrant lncRNA in GC. In addition, we used the high-throughput microarray to identify the target gene of the aberrant lncRNA. We found that FLJ22763, a novel lncRNA, had significantly lower expression in GC tissues. Decreased expression of FLJ22763 was positively correlated with a lower-level histological grade and the depth of invasion. The ectopic expression of lncRNA FLJ22763 significantly suppressed the biological malignant behavior of GC cells and inhibited xenograft tumor growth (both P < 0.001). Notably, FLJ22763 displayed a considerable predictive effect in the prognosis of GC (log-rank, P = 0.003). Furthermore, we found that FLJ22763 was negatively associated with ACLY, regulating the mRNA and protein levels of ACLY.

    "Abstract": "Background: Protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), an endoplasmic reticulum protein, is expressed in bladder of BC patients. However, its role in BC has been elusive till now. Objectives: This study was conducted to assess whether PDIA3 gene expression was associated with increased odds of BC, in particular muscle-invasive BC (MIBC). Methods: Ninety three patients underwent cystoscopy and bladder tumors were biopsied and histologically assessed. Data collected including: patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Biochemical markers: hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), Malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy 2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and reduced glutathione (GSH) and molecular marker PDIA3 gene expression were measured. Results: According to the tumor grade and stage, 36 patients were found to have MIBC, 27 patients have non MIBC (NMIBC) and 30 patients have no bladder lesions (control group). PDIA3 gene expression level had the largest contribution to a multivariable model for predicting BC, which achieved 89.0% predictive accuracy. The AUC for discriminating MIBC significantly increased from 0.644 to 0.938 when biochemical markers were replaced by molecular PDIA3 marker in the final model. Conclusions: Using PDIA3 expression along with prior information of patient's age, bilharzial history with gross hematuria, can help clinicians predict BC, discriminate MIBC and decide consequently the most promising therapeutic management in Egyptian population. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbonyls were evaluated in typical dwellings in Xi'an in northwestern China in wintertime. High indoor concentrations were observed for formaldehyde, acetone, naphthalene, methylene chloride and acetaldehyde, associated with characteristic pollution sources. In comparison, many of the target VOCs were higher in Chinese dwellings than those in other countries, suggesting the significances of indoor pollutions in China. Source apportionment with receptor model shows that furniture and building materials (44.5%), paints and adhesives (11.9%), household products (17.3%), smoking (14.5%), and cooking (9.8%) are the major contributors to the indoor VOCs and carbonyls. The health risk assessment shows that the cancer risks for formaldehyde (5.73 × 10 −5 ), 1,3-butadiene (2.07 × 10 −5 ) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1.44 × 10 −5 ) were much higher than the acceptable level of 1 × 10 −6 recommended by International Register for Certified Auditors (IRCA). The hazard quotient (HQ) of target VOCs were far less than the threshold (HQ = 1). Moreover, the practical efficiency of household air purifier in removal of the VOCs and carbonyls was examined first time in dwellings in northern China. The results prove that most of the indoor organic pollutants and their cancer risk to humans can be efficiently reduced, particularly for formaldehyde and 1,3-butadiene. The findings of the study offer useful preliminary and updated information on current indoor air toxics levels, dominant pollution sources and their potential health risks to residents in northwest China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The paper presents a study of organochlorine compounds in street dust, an often forgotten aspect of urban environmental pollution. Six different polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and eighteen organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were monitored in terms of levels, distribution, seasonal variation and health risks. Street dust samples were collected from fifteen urban locations in Novi Sad including schools, recreational areas, residential and industrial zones. Street dust concentration of PCBs ranged from less than the limit of detection (&lt;LOD) to 12.1 ng g −1 (mean = 0.58 ng g −1 ) in summer and from &lt;LOD to 3.82 ng g −1 (mean = 0.45 ng g −1 ) in winter. Among the investigated OCPs, only dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) were detected - their concentration varied from &lt;LOD to 34.7 ng g −1 (mean = 6.2 ng g −1 and median = 1.4 ng g −1 ) in summer to &lt;LOD to 50.5 ng g −1 (mean = 7.1 ng g −1 and median = 2.0 ng g −1 ) in winter. Principal component analysis indicated a positive correlation among PCB 101, PCB 153 and pH as well as between PCB 138 and organic matter. Regression analysis revealed that distribution trends of DDTs between the soil and street dust samples are significantly correlated in the recreational areas. The average level of total lifetime carcinogenic risk (TLCR) for PCBs (3.7 × 10 −9 ) and DDTs (3.6 × 10 −9 ) found in Novi Sad street dust samples were well below the unacceptable level of 10 −6 , indicating that the lifetime cancer risk was acceptable. It was also found that the seasonal variations were not significant. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Whether plasma miRNAs could be used as novel non-invasive biomarkers in diagnosing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains unknown. In this study, we designed a four-phase study to identify differentially expressed plasma miRNAs in Chinese PTC patients. Exiqon panel was initially utilized to conduct plasma miRNA profile (3 PTC pools VS. 1 healthy control (HC) pool; each 10 samples were pooled as 1 sample). The dysregulated miRNAs were then analyzed in the training (30 PTC VS. 30 HCs), testing (57 PTC VS. 54 HCs) and external validation phases (33 PTC VS. 30HCs). The identified miRNAs were further affirmed in benign nodules (2 nodular goiter (NG) pool VS. 1 HC pool). We also verified the expression of identified miRNAs in 17 matched malignant and normal tissue samples, NG plasma samples (29 PTC VS. 29 NG) and plasma exosomes (25 PTC VS. 25 HCs). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the identified miRNAs. As a result, the screening phase demonstrated 30 dysregulated plasma miRNAs in PTC patients compared with HCs. After multiphase experiment processes, miR-346, miR-10a-5p and miR-34a-5p were found significantly elevated in PTC plasma samples relative to HCs. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of the three-miRNA panel for the training, testing and validation phases were 0.926, 0.811 and 0.816, separately. The panel could also differentiate PTC from NG with the AUC of 0.877. MiR-346 and miR-34a-5p but not miR-10a-5p were up-regulated in PTC tissues. And the three miRNAs showed consistently up-regulation in PTC plasma exosomes. In conclusion, our study established a three-miRNA panel in plasma with considerable clinical value in discriminating PTC from HC or NG. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy related cognitive impairment (CTRC; “chemobrain”) is a syndrome that is associated with the impairment of various aspects of cognition, including executive function, processing speed, and multitasking. The role of neurotransmitter release in the expression of cognitive impairments is not well known. In this work we employed a newly developed behavioral paradigm to measure attentional shifting, a fundamental component of executive function, in rats treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a commonly used cancer chemotherapy agent. We found that one and two weeks of 5-FU treatment significantly impaired attentional shifting compared to baseline, while saline treatment had no effect. Post-mortem analysis of these rats revealed that 5-FU caused a significant overall decrease in dopamine release as well. Collectively, these results demonstrate the feasibility of our attentional shifting paradigm for evaluating the cognitive effects of chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, these results support the need for additional studies to determine if impaired dopamine release plays a role in chemobrain. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Traditionally, physicians need to manually delineate the suspected breast cancer area. Numerous studies have mentioned that manual segmentation takes time, and depends on the machine and the operator. The algorithm called Convolutional Neural Network Improvement for Breast Cancer Classification (CNNI-BCC) is presented to assist medical experts in breast cancer diagnosis in timely manner. The CNNI-BCC uses a convolutional neural network that improves the breast cancer lesion classification in order to help experts for breast cancer diagnosis. CNNI-BCC can classify incoming breast cancer medical images into malignant, benign, and healthy patients. The application of present algorithm can assist in classification of mammographic medical images into benign patient, malignant patient and healthy patient without prior information of the presence of a cancerous lesion. The presented method aims to help medical experts for the classification of breast cancer lesion through the implementation of convolutional neural network for the classification of breast cancer. CNNI-BCC can categorize incoming medical images as malignant, benign or normal patient with sensitivity, accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and specificity of 89.47%, 90.50%, 0.901 ± 0.0314 and 90.71% respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Although the countries of Sub-Sharan Africa represent among the most rapidly growing and aging populations worldwide, no previous studies have examined the cancer patterns in older adults in the region as a means to inform cancer policies. Using data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, we describe recent patterns and trends in incidence rates for the major cancer sites in adults aged ≥60 years and in people aged 0–59 for comparison in four selected population-based cancer registries in Kenya (Nairobi), the Republic of South Africa (Eastern Cape Province), Uganda (Kyadondo country), and Zimbabwe (Harare blacks). Over the period 2008–2012, almost 9,000 new cancer cases were registered in older adults in the four populations, representing one-third of all cancer cases. Prostate and esophageal cancers were the leading cancer sites in older males, while breast, cervical and esophageal cancers were the most common among older females. Among younger people, Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were common. Over the past 20 years, incidence rates among older adults have increased in both sexes in Uganda and Zimbabwe while rates have stabilized among the younger age group. Among older adults, the largest rate increase was observed for breast cancer (estimated annual percentage change: 5% in each country) in females and for prostate cancer (6–7%) in males. Due to the specific needs of older adults, tailored considerations should be given to geriatric oncology when developing, funding and implementing national and regional cancer programmes. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "ARHGAP17 has long been thought to be involved in the maintenance of tight junction and epithelial barrier. Recently, a few Rho GTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs) have been identified as tumor suppressors in some human cancers. The present study aimed to explore ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer and the possible function in tumor progression. ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer cell lines was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer tissues and normal tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The cell proliferation was determined using CCK-8 in vitro and subcutaneous xenograft model in vivo. Here, we showed lower expression of ARHGAP17 in cell lines and human cervical cancer samples. Manipulation of ARHGAP17 affected cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of AKT was enhanced in ARHGAP17 silencing cervical cancer cells. ARHGAP17 can elevate P21 and P27 expression level through inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Stepwise investigations demonstrated that ARHGAP17 suppressed malignant phenotype of cervical cancer cells via inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These results reveal that ARHGAP17 functions as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer that suppresses tumor growth, at least partly, through inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling and up-regulation of P21 and P27 expression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Dietary factors that contribute to chronic low-grade metabolic acidosis have been linked to breast cancer risk, but to date no epidemiologic study has examined diet-dependent acid load and breast cancer. We used data from 43,570 Sister Study participants who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire at enrollment (2003–2009) and satisfied eligibility criteria. The Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) score was used to estimate diet-dependent acid load. Higher scores reflect greater consumption of protein and phosphorus, and lower consumption of potassium, calcium and magnesium. The association between PRAL and breast cancer was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. We identified 1,614 invasive breast cancers diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment (mean follow-up, 7.6 years). The highest PRAL quartile, reflecting greater acid-forming potential, was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 1.21 [95% CI, 1.04–1.41], p trend = 0.04). The association was more pronounced for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 1.67 [95% CI, 1.07–2.61], p trend = 0.03) and triple-negative breast cancer (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 2.20 [95% CI, 1.23–3.95], p trend = 0.02). Negative PRAL scores, representing consumption of alkaline diets, were associated with decreased risk of ER-negative and triple-negative breast cancer, compared to a PRAL score of 0 representing neutral pH. Higher diet-dependent acid load may be a risk factor for breast cancer while alkaline diets may be protective. Since PRAL scores are positively correlated with meat consumption and negatively correlated with fruit and vegetable intake, results also suggest that diets high in fruits and vegetables and low in meat may be protective against hormone receptor negative breast cancer. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Recent analyses have suggested decreases over time in colorectal cancer incidence at older ages (≥55 years) but increases at younger ages (20–54 years). Understanding the geographic heterogeneity of incidence facilitates resource allocation for potential interventions and advances our knowledge of differential etiologies for these cancers. We performed age-period-cohort analysis using 2000–2014 county-level incidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, estimating relative risk (RR) and age-adjusted annual percent change (Net Drifts) simultaneously for 612 counties via a hierarchical model, separately for colon and rectum cancer, stratified by age group (20–54 vs. 55–84). We also studied correlates of RR and Net Drift with various county-level characteristics. In all SEER counties, colon and rectum cancer incidence rates increased at ages 20–54, whereas rates decreased at ages 55–84. There was marked heterogeneity in both RR and Net Drift among states and counties for both cancer types. Maps of county RR and Net Drift revealed localized clusters in several states. For both cancer types, counties with high RR and unfavorable Net Drift tended to have higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes and to be of a lower socioeconomic status. Counties with higher overall screening rates tended to have lower Net Drifts for both cancer types. Increasing colorectal cancer incidence in the younger age group is geographically widespread, although there is significant heterogeneity in temporal trends and risk both within and between states. These geographic patterns correlate with different county-level characteristics depending on cancer type and age group. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Lycopene and green tea consumption have been observationally associated with reduced prostate cancer risk, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the effect of factorial randomisation to a 6-month lycopene and green tea dietary advice or supplementation intervention on 159 serum metabolite measures in 128 men with raised PSA levels (but prostate cancer-free), analysed by intention-to-treat. The causal effects of metabolites modified by the intervention on prostate cancer risk were then assessed by Mendelian randomisation, using summary statistics from 44,825 prostate cancer cases and 27,904 controls. The systemic effects of lycopene and green tea supplementation on serum metabolic profile were comparable to the effects of the respective dietary advice interventions (R 2 = 0.65 and 0.76 for lycopene and green tea respectively). Metabolites which were altered in response to lycopene supplementation were acetate [β (standard deviation difference vs. placebo): 0.69; 95% CI = 0.24, 1.15; p = 0.003], valine (β: −0.62; −1.03, −0.02; p = 0.004), pyruvate (β: −0.56; −0.95, −0.16; p = 0.006) and docosahexaenoic acid (β: −0.50; −085, −0.14; p = 0.006). Valine and diacylglycerol were lower in the lycopene dietary advice group (β: −0.65; −1.04, −0.26; p = 0.001 and β: −0.59; −1.01, −0.18; p = 0.006). A genetically instrumented SD increase in pyruvate increased the odds of prostate cancer by 1.29 (1.03, 1.62; p = 0.027). An intervention to increase lycopene intake altered the serum metabolome of men at risk of prostate cancer. Lycopene lowered levels of pyruvate, which our Mendelian randomisation analysis suggests may be causally related to reduced prostate cancer risk. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "In this work, we aimed to understand the biological activity and the mechanism of action of three polymer-‘ruthenium-cyclopentadienyl’ conjugates (RuPMC) and a low molecular weight parental compound (Ru1) in cancer cells. Several biological assays were performed in ovarian (A2780) and breast (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) human cancer derived cell lines as well as in A2780cis, a cisplatin resistant cancer cell line. Our results show that all compounds have high activity towards cancer cells with low IC 50 values in the micromolar range. We observed that all Ru-PMC compounds are mainly found inside the cells, in contrast with the parental low molecular weight compound Ru1 that was mainly found at the membrane. All compounds induced mitochondrial alterations. PMC3 and Ru1 caused F-actin cytoskeleton morphology changes and reduced the clonogenic ability of the cells. The conjugate PMC3 induced apoptosis at low concentrations comparing to cisplatin and could overcame the platinum resistance of A2780cis cancer cells. A proteomic analysis showed that these compounds induce alterations in several cellular proteins which are related to the phenotypic disorders induced by them. Our results suggest that PMC3 is foreseen as a lead candidate to future studies and acting through a different mechanism of action than cisplatin. Here we established the potential of these Ru compounds as new metallodrugs for cancer chemotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "An expanded set of pyridazine-containing benzene sulfonamides was investigated for inhibition of four human carbonic anhydrase isoforms, which revealed a pronounced inhibition trend toward hCA IX, a cancer-related, membrane-bound isoform of the enzyme. Comparison of antiproliferative effects of these compounds against cancer (PANC-1) and normal (ARPE-19) cells at 50 μM concentration narrowed the selection of compounds to the eight which displayed selective growth inhibition toward the cancer cells. More detailed investigation in concentration-dependent mode against normal (ARPE-19) and two cancer cell lines (PANC-1 and SK-MEL-2) identified two lead compounds one of which displayed a notable cytotoxicity toward pancreatic cancer cells while the other targeted the melanoma cells. These findings significantly expand the knowledge base concerning the hCA IX inhibitors whose inhibitory potency against a recombinant enzyme translates into selective anticancer activity under hypoxic conditions which are aimed to model the environment of a growing tumor. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown an elevated risk for preterm delivery among early onset cancer survivors. Whether the preterm delivery starts spontaneously, due to possible uterine damage because of cancer treatment, or is induced due to maternal conditions is unclear. Our aim was to assess pregnancy related conditions in female cancer survivors possibly underlying the elevated risk for preterm labor. Nationwide cancer and birth registries were merged to identify 1,753 first deliveries of cancer survivors (diagnosed below 40 years of age) and 5,123 first deliveries of matched female comparison subjects between January 1991 and December 2013. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk for pregnancy related conditions adjusting for maternal age, gestational age and smoking. We found an overall increased risk for hospitalization during pregnancy (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.25–1.68), intrahepatic cholestasis (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.09–7.49), fear of childbirth (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.31–3.85) and mental disorders and diseases of the nervous system complicating pregnancy and labor (OR 5.89, 95% CI 2.31–15.00). Among survivors, 129 (7.4%) delivered preterm compared to 268 (5.2%) comparisons subjects (p = 0.004). We found a statistically significant increased risk for preterm delivery among cancer survivors with vaginal bleeding (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07–1.71) and pre-eclampsia (1.35, 95% CI 1.06–1.72) compared to comparison subjects with the same condition. Health professionals treating these women should be aware of these risks. In general, however, our results are reassuring when it comes to pregnancies among cancer survivors. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are potential pathogenic factors of pancreatic cancer. Although fruits and vegetables are abundant in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory constituents, the reported associations between fruit and vegetable intake and pancreatic cancer risk have been inconsistent. Here, we investigated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and pancreatic cancer risk as part of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. The analysis included 90,185 participants who responded to a medical and lifestyle questionnaire during 1995–1998. Associations between fruit and vegetable intake and pancreatic cancer risk were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards models. Additional analyses were stratified by smoking status and body mass index. During follow-up (median duration, 16.9 years), 577 participants were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In multivariate-adjusted models, pancreatic cancer risk was inversely associated with total fruit intake (highest vs. lowest intake quartile; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57–0.95, p-trend: 0.116) and positively associated with total vegetable intake (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.01–1.66, p-trend: 0.151). For total fruit intake, the inverse association with pancreatic cancer risk was more apparent in never smokers (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47–0.97, p-trend: 0.034). For total vegetable intake, the positive association was statistically significant in ever smokers (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.01–2.19, p-trend: 0.043) and statistically nonsignificant in never smokers. In summary, total fruit intake and total vegetable intake had inverse and positive associations, respectively, with pancreatic cancer risk. Vegetable intake may correlate with increased risk partly because of the influence of smoking on vegetable intake. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Recently, we identified unique processing patterns of apolipoprotein A2 (ApoA2) in patients with pancreatic cancer. Our study provides a first prospective evaluation of an ApoA2 isoform (“ApoA2-ATQ/AT”), alone and in combination with carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9), as an early detection biomarker for pancreatic cancer. We performed ELISA measurements of CA19-9 and ApoA2-ATQ/AT in 156 patients with pancreatic cancer and 217 matched controls within the European EPIC cohort, using plasma samples collected up to 60 months prior to diagnosis. The detection discrimination statistics were calculated for risk scores by strata of lag-time. For CA19-9, in univariate marker analyses, C-statistics to distinguish future pancreatic cancer patients from cancer-free individuals were 0.80 for plasma taken ≤6 months before diagnosis, and 0.71 for >6–18 months; for ApoA2-ATQ/AT, C-statistics were 0.62, and 0.65, respectively. Joint models based on ApoA2-ATQ/AT plus CA19-9 significantly improved discrimination within >6–18 months (C = 0.74 vs. 0.71 for CA19-9 alone, p = 0.022) and ≤ 18 months (C = 0.75 vs. 0.74, p = 0.022). At 98% specificity, and for lag times of ≤6, >6–18 or ≤ 18 months, sensitivities were 57%, 36% and 43% for CA19-9 combined with ApoA2-ATQ/AT, respectively, vs. 50%, 29% and 36% for CA19-9 alone. Compared to CA19-9 alone, the combination of CA19-9 and ApoA2-ATQ/AT may improve detection of pancreatic cancer up to 18 months prior to diagnosis under usual care, and may provide a useful first measure for pancreatic cancer detection prior to imaging. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Probabilistic lifetime cancer risks and non-cancer risks of trihalomethanes (THMs) through ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation exposure in 88 drinking water treatment plants (WTPs) with raw waters from five water systems (WSs) in Jiangsu Province were analyzed and compared. Concentrations of THMs in finished water of study WTPs varied, ranging from 18.81 to 38.96 μg/L, which are lower than the maximum of 80 μg/L recommended by USEPA. The results of health risk assessment indicated that cancer risk as well as non-cancer risks of THMs in WTPs sourced from five water systems decreased in the order of WS3 > WS5 > WS2 > WS1 > WS4. The comparison among multiple exposure routes indicated that when non-boiled drinking water is consumed, ingestion has the highest exposure route, with exposure values greater than dermal contact and inhalation for WTPs with raw water from all five water systems. However, when drinking boiled water, dermal contact is the major risk source for WTPs with raw water from WS1 and WS2, instead of dermal contact, inhalation becomes the major risk source for WTPs with raw water from WS3, WS4, and WS5. In WTPs with raw water from water systems WS1, WS3, WS4, and WS5, dibromochloromethane (DBCM) in THMs has the highest contribution to cancer risk, while chloroform in THMs has the highest contribution to non-cancer risk. However, in WTPs with raw water from water system WS2, bromodichloromethane (BDCM) has the highest contribution to both cancer risk and non-cancer risk. The results also indicated that females are prone to cancer risk induced by THMs since Chinese people are accustomed to drinking boiled water. The results supply valuable information for health departments to put forward more specific and efficient policies to control water borne diseases. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Prior epidemiologic findings for plasma folate and B-vitamins and breast cancer risk are inconsistent and have not assessed the influence of folic acid fortification. Therefore, we examined the associations of plasma folate, B 12 , pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), homocysteine, cysteine and cysteinylglycine with breast cancer risk, before and after fortification. We conducted a nested case–control study within the prospective Nurses’ Health Study. In 1989–1990 (pre-fortification), 32,826 women donated a blood sample and 18,743 donated an additional blood sample in 2000–2001 (post-fortification). Between the first blood collection and 2006, 1874 incident breast cancer cases with at least one blood sample and 367 with two were 1:1 matched to controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusting for breast cancer risk factors. Overall, higher plasma folate, B 12 , PLP, homocysteine, cysteine and cysteinylglycine levels were not associated with breast cancer risk. Associations did not vary by in situ/invasive, hormone receptor status, or tumor molecular subtype. Additionally, associations were null before and after fortification. For example, the RR (95% CI) for the highest versus lowest tertile of 1990 (pre-fortification) plasma folate with 1990–2000 follow-up was 0.93 (0.75–1.16) and for the 2000 plasma folate (post-fortification) with 2000–2006 follow-up the RR (95% CI) was 1.17 (0.79–1.74). Plasma folate, B 12 , PLP, homocysteine, cysteine and cysteinylglycine were not significantly associated with breast cancer overall, before and after fortification, or with specific tumor molecular subtypes. However, long term associations (&gt;8 years) after the implementation of fortification could not be examined. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Terbinafine is used for the treatment of several superficial fungal infections. In silico analyses and animal models suggest that terbinafine might have an anti-tumor effect. We aimed to explore whether subsequent administration of terbinafine might be associated with a lower mortality rate in patients with prostate cancer. We identified patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between July 2005 and December 2014 from the Swedish Cancer Registry, and linked them to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register to ascertain subsequent use of terbinafine. A total of 799 patients received oral treatment of terbinafine during the study period with a mortality rate of 18.6 per 1,000 person-years. Compared to patients who did not use terbinafine and adjusting for a range of confounding factors, patients that received oral treatment of terbinafine had a decreased risk of death from prostate cancer (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38–0.73) and a decreased risk of death overall (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52–0.77). To account for indication bias, we further identified 907 patients who received topical use of terbinafine. However, the risk of death from prostate cancer in patients with topical use of terbinafine was 0.92 (95% CI 0.74–1.12) and the risk of death overall was 1.03 (95% CI 0.91–1.17) as compared to the controls, which suggests that there was no association between risk of death in patients with prostate cancer with topical use of terbinafine. These findings suggest that this drug's potential anti-tumor effect needs to be explored further. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "A convenient and efficient strategy for detecting cancer cells at preclinical stages is one of the dominant challenges in early cancer diagnostics. In this work, a sandwich-type cytosensor was structured to analyze cancer cells based on metal organic framework PCN-224 and DNA tetrahedron linked dual-aptamer. Firstly, the tetrahedral DNA nanostructures linked dual aptamers (AS1411 and MUC1) immobilizing on the gold electrode (GE) surface as bio-recognition elements can capture the MCF-7 cancer cells and improve the density and orientation of surface nanoprobes. Then, the novel metal organic framework PCN-224 homogeneously decorated by Pt nanoparticles was modified by the G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and dual-aptamer. The fabricated nanoprobes were applied to catalyze the oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) for amplifying the electrochemical signal. The results indicated that the linear response of the aptasensor ranged from 20 to 1 × 10 7 cells/mL and the detection limit was 6 cells/mL. Finally, we performed an electrochemical reductive desorption to break gold–thiol bond and release all compounds on the electrode surface for analyzing the viability of collected cells and regenerating the cytosensor. This work can be extended to other cancer cells by using specific type aptamers and has widely applications prospect in point-of-care cancer diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The incidence of laryngeal cancer (LYC) is second only to lung cancer, which is also the second most common cancer in head and neck cancer. Risk assessment metabolomics biomarkers to diagnose LYC have not been found by now. To profile the metabolites in healthy controls (HCs) and LYC patients (LYCs), urine metabonomics study was performed based on reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RPLC-QTOF/MS). Six urine differentially expressed metabolites (Variable Importance in Projection >1, p < 0.05) were identified by searching reference library or comparing with standard based on OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis) model. D-pantothenic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, oleamide, sphinganine and phytosphingosine were identified as differential metabolites associated with the LYC and they might play roles in sphingolipid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, beta-Alanine metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. These six differential metabolites were combined to test the potentiality of diagnosis of LYC. Results revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) value, sensitivity and specificity of receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.97, 95% and 97%, respectively, indicating that this diagnosis method could be used to distinguish LYCs from HCs with good sensitivity and specificity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The great therapeutical success achieved by oncology is counterbalanced by growing evidences of cardiovascular (CV) toxicity due to many antineoplastic treatments. Cardiac adverse events may cause premature discontinuation of effective oncologic treatments or occur as late events undermining the oncologic success. Arterial hypertension is both the most common comorbidity in cancer patients and a frequent adverse effect of anticancer therapies. A pre-existing hypertension is known to increase the risk of other cardiac adverse events due to oncologic treatments, in particular heart failure. Moreover, as a strict association between cancer and CV diseases has emerged over the recent years, various analyses have shown a direct relationship between hypertension and cancer incidence and mortality. Finally, many antineoplastic treatments may cause a rise in blood pressure (BP) values, particularly the novel anti VEGF agents, this possibly compromising efficacy of chemotherapy. Aim of this review is to revise the topic and the many aspects linking arterial hypertension and cancer, and to provide a comprehensive and practical guide of the current treatment approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "SGA is a sulfated glucan from Antrodia cinnamomea. In this study, we showed that SGA suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. SGA also potentiated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in lung cancer cells. TGFβ signaling and overexpression of Slug are regarded as the critical events in lung tumor malignancy. Functional studies revealed that SGA inhibited the TGFβ/FAK/AKT axis by inducing lipid-raft-mediated lysosome-dependent TGFβ receptor degradation, resulting in suppressing cancer cell viability and migration. Moreover, SGA elimination of TGFβ-mediated intracellular signaling promoted Slug degradation in H1975 cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that proteasome-dependent Slug degradation was controlled by TGFβ-mediated downstream signaling pathways; however, inhibitors of AKT and GSK3 abolished Slug degradation. Our findings suggested that SGA targets of the TGFβ/AKT/GSK3β axis played a key role in enhancing Slug degradation and suppressing lung cancer cells. In addition, SGA may be a potential therapeutic supplement for lung cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Stimuli-responsive drug release and controlled delivery play crucial roles in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and lowering over-dosage induced side effects. In this paper, we report magnetically-triggered drug release and in-vitro anti-colon cancer efficacy of Fe 3 O 4 @cellulose nanocrystal (MCNC)-stabilized Pickering emulsions containing curcumin (CUR). The loading efficiency of CUR in the micron-sized (≈7 μm) MCNC-stabilized Pickering emulsions (MCNC-PE) template was found to be 99.35%. The drug release profiles showed that the exposure of MCNC-PE to external magnetic field (EMF) (0.7 T) stimulated the release of bioactive from MCNC-PE achieving 53.30 ± 5.08% of the initial loading over a 4-day period. The MTT assay demonstrated that the CUR-loaded MCNC-PE can effectively inhibits the human colon cancer cells growth down to 18% in the presence of EMF. The formulation also resulted in 2-fold reduction on the volume of the 3-D multicellular spheroids of HCT116 as compared to the control sample. The MCNC particle was found to be non-toxic to brine shrimp up to a concentration of 100 μg/mL. Our findings suggested that the palm-based MCNC-PE could be a promising yet effective colloidal drug delivery system for magnetic-triggered release of bioactive and therapeutics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Most cancer diagnoses rely on biomarkers detection. This could be improved if directly conducted in suspicious cancer spots, preventing the need for biopsy. Lung cancer remains a perfect study-case for such a development, as it is generally detected at advanced stage and is in the need for early diagnosis techniques. To this aim, we have designed a minimally invasive catheter-embedded biosensor. It combines a specific grating structure photo-imprinted in a telecommunication-grade optical fiber and an overlay made of a thin metal coating on which receptors are grafted, yielding plasmonic coupling. Our optrode targets a type of cytokeratins, overexpressed at the surface of cancer cells. It was assayed ex vivo in resected lung tissues collected from a dozen of patients. Biosensing responses were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, conducted on the same samples. In addition to accurate biosensing, our gratings inherently enable force-sensing features, which also allow a fine positioning of the probe in the tissue. Finally, the in vivo navigation of the bronchoscope-embedded sensor was validated into pig lungs. These achievements are a critical milestone towards the development of this micro/nano biosensor as a cost-effective and weakly invasive diagnostic tool for applications in areas of critical access such as brain, liver or prostate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The uncommonness of gallbladder cancer in the developed world has contributed to the generally poor understanding of the disease. Our integrated analysis of whole exome sequencing, copy number alterations, immunohistochemical, and phospho-proteome array profiling indicates ERBB2 alterations in 40% early-stage rare gallbladder tumors, among an ethnically distinct population not studied before, that occurs through overexpression in 24% (n = 25) and recurrent mutations in 14% tumors (n = 44); along with co-occurring KRAS mutation in 7% tumors (n = 44). We demonstrate that ERBB2 heterodimerizes with EGFR to constitutively activate the ErbB signaling pathway in gallbladder cells. Consistent with this, treatment with ERBB2-specific, EGFR-specific shRNA or with a covalent EGFR family inhibitor Afatinib inhibits tumor-associated characteristics of the gallbladder cancer cells. Furthermore, we observe an in vivo reduction in tumor size of gallbladder xenografts in response to Afatinib is paralleled by a reduction in the amounts of phospho-ERK, in tumors harboring KRAS (G13D) mutation but not in KRAS (G12V) mutation, supporting an essential role of the ErbB pathway. In overall, besides implicating ERBB2 as an important therapeutic target under neo-adjuvant or adjuvant settings, we present the first evidence that the presence of KRAS mutations may preclude gallbladder cancer patients to respond to anti-EGFR treatment, similar to a clinical algorithm commonly practiced to opt for anti-EGFR treatment in colorectal cancer. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in xenobiotics metabolism (XM) are suspected to play a role in breast cancer risk. However, previous findings based on a SNP by SNP approach need to be replicated taking into account the combined effects of multiple SNPs. We used a gene-set analysis method to study the association between breast cancer risk and genetic variation in XM genes (seen as a set of SNPs) and in the XM pathway (seen as a set of genes). We also studied the interaction between variants in XM genes and tobacco smoking. The analysis was conducted in a case–control study of 1,125 cases and 1,172 controls. Using a dedicated chip, genotyping data of 585 SNPs in 68 XM genes were available. Genetic variation in the whole XM pathway was significantly associated with premenopausal breast cancer risk (p = 0.008). This association was mainly driven by genetic variation in NAT2, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, AKR1C2 and ALDH1A3. The association between the XM gene pathway and breast cancer was observed among current and previous smokers, but not among never smokers (p = 0.013 for interaction between XM genes and tobacco smoking status). The association with breast cancer risk indicates that XM genes variants may play a role in breast carcinogenesis through their detoxification function of environmental pollutants, such as those contained in tobacco smoke. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer according to worldwide incidences statistics. The correct diagnosis of this lesion leads to the indication of the most adequate treatments for cancer-affected patients. The diagnosis is made through the visual analysis of tissue samples by pathologists. However, this analysis is susceptible to intra- and inter-pathologists variability in addition to being a complex and time-consuming task. To deal with these challenges, image processing methods are developed for application on histological images obtained through the digitization of the tissue samples. To do so, feature extraction and classification techniques are investigated to aid pathologists and make it possible a faster and more objective diagnosis definition. Therefore, in this work, we propose a method that associates multidimensional fractal techniques, curvelet transforms and Haralick descriptors for the study and pattern recognition of colorectal cancer, which not yet explored in the Literature. The proposed method considered a feature selection approach and different classification techniques for evaluating associations, such as decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, naive Bayes, k* and a polynomial method. This strategy allowed for more precise interpretations regarding the best associations for the separation of groups concerning histological images of colorectal cancer. The proposal was tested on colorectal images from two distinct datasets commonly investigated in the Literature. The best result was reached with features based mainly on lacunarity and percolation obtained from curvelet sub-images, using a polynomial classifier. The tests were evaluated by applying the 10-fold cross-validation method and the result was 0.994 of AUC, which is a relevant contribution to the Literature of pattern recognition of colorectal cancer. The obtained performance with a detailed analysis involving different types of features and classifiers are important contributions for pathologists, specialists interested in the study of this cancer and histological image processing researchers, which aim to develop the clinically applicable computational techniques. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. According to previous studies, vanillin possesses pharmacological and anticancer activities. In this work, we have modified the structure of vanillin to obtain a vanillin derivative called 4-(1H-imidazo [4,5-f][1,10]-phenanthrolin-2-yl)-2-methoxyphenol (IPM711), which has improved anticancer activity. The present study is intended to explore the anti-colorectal cancer activity of IPM711 in HT29 and HCT116 cells. The results of this study suggest that IPM711 can inhibit the growth, invasion and migration of HT29 and HCT116 cells. Western blot and molecular docking showed that IPM711 could bind to a Wnt/β-catenin signaling receptor to inhibit cell growth, invasion and migration in HT29 cells. Based on these results, IPM711 is a promising anticancer drug candidate for human colorectal cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Despite huge successes achieved by strand displacement amplification (SDA) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in biomolecules sensing, the strategy of combination of SDA and AuNPs-based dynamic light scattering (DLS) for a biomolecule sensing is unexplored. Here we developed a non-invasive, SDA-based DLS method for the diagnosis of bladder cancer by detecting telomerase activity in human urine. In the presence of telomerase, the telomerase substrate (TS) primer was elongated with repeating sequences of (TTAGGG)n, and the resulting product triggers SDA between the hairpin deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and the Primer. The SDA product can be recognized by the oligonucleotide-modified AuNPs probes, resulting in DLS measurable AuNPs aggregation. The assay displayed a detection limit of 3 MCF-7 cells with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 in a dynamic range of 5–1000 cells. The method was simple, reliable and has been successfully applied in the detection of telomerase in urine with good accuracy, selectivity and reproducibility. Moreover, only urine samples from bladder cancer patients induced a significant change in the average hydrodynamic diameter, indicating practical applicability of the method for the non-invasive diagnosis of bladder cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Early and precise diagnosis of cancer is critical for a better prognosis. Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective plasmonic paper as a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate in combination with magnetic separation for cancer screening. The plasmonic paper was fabricated by immersing plain filter paper into gold nanorod solution and the SERS property of the paper was evaluated using 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) and rhodamine 6 G (R6 G), which showed an enhancement factor (EF) in the range of 10 6 –10 8 . HT-29, a colorectal cancer cell line that highly expresses epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), served as the target cells; non-EpCAM-expressing cells, namely fibroblasts and red blood cells (RBCs), were used as negative controls. Intrinsic SERS spectra of the target and control cells showed distinctive patterns on the plasmonic paper due to differences in their structure and components. A combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and k-nearest-neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was employed to analyze and distinguish the acquired HT-29 and fibroblast SERS spectra, demonstrating a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 84.8% and 82.6%, respectively, whereas the differentiation between HT-29 and RBCs SERS spectra showed a sensitivity and specificity of 96.4% and 100%, respectively. The magnetic separation was applied to capture the target cells from cell mixtures followed by PCA and k-NN analysis. The identification of the captured cells as cancerous cells from the HT-29 and fibroblast mixture indicated an accuracy of 83.7%, while that from a mixture of HT-29 and RBCs was 98.2%. Thus, the simple paper-based SERS substrate with the assistance of magnetic enrichment and multivariate analysis offers a potent new platform for cancer cell detection and screening. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase (PAICS), a de novo purine metabolic enzyme, has been identified as an oncogene in several tumor types, including breast cancer and prostate cancer. However, the role of PAICS in human lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) requires further study. Methods: In this research, the effects of PAICS on the occurrence and prognosis of LADC were evaluated using integrative bioinformatics analyses. Results: By employing the bioinformatics analyses of several public databases, PAICS, which is overexpressed in the LADC tissues, was identified as a potential tumor-promoting gene in LADC biology. Several relevant clinical studies indicated that the upregulation of PAICS was statistically correlated with a shorter overall survival time. Moreover, the carcinogenic function of PAICS in LADC was validated by the further protein-protein interactions (PPI) and biological process annotation analysis. Mechanistically, we found that the PAICS methylation level was significantly lower in the LADC tissues compared to the normal lung tissues. Furthermore, using the MEXPRESS web tool, we predicted 15 possible DNA methylation sites in the nucleotide sequences of PAICS, which could explain the alteration in the PAICS expression levels in LADC. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that high levels of PAICS are found in LADC and that this gene may be a potential therapeutic target for this subset of lung cancers. Determining the detailed roles of PAICS in LADC biology may provide useful information for further investigations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) coordinates glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and serine synthesis to promote tumor growth through the regulation of its substrate 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PG) and product 2-phosphoglycerate (2 PG). Herein, based on our previously reported PGAM1 inhibitor PGMI-004A, we have developed anthraquinone derivatives as novel allosteric PGAM1 inhibitors and the structure−activity relationship (SAR) was investigated. In addition, we determined the co-crystal structure of PGAM1 and the inhibitor 8g, demonstrating that the inhibitor was located at a novel allosteric site. Among the derivatives, compound 8t was selected for further study, with IC 50 values of 0.25 and approximately 5 μM in enzymatic and cell-based assays, respectively. Mechanistically, compound 8t reduced the glycolysis and oxygen consumption rate in cancer cells, which led to decreased adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) production and subsequent 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. The inhibitor 8t also exhibited good efficacy in delaying tumor growth in H1299 xenograft model without obvious toxicity. Taken together, this proof-of-principle work further validates PGAM1 as a potential target for cancer therapy and provides useful information on anti-tumor drug discovery targeting PGAM1. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Emerging data indicate that interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) plays an important role in many cancers. However, it remains unclear whether IFITM1 is functionally indispensable in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, using NSCLC cell lines and patient-derived samples, we show that IFITM1 is essentially required for the progression of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, IFITM1 depletion resulted in a significant reduction in sphere formation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro; these events were inversely correlated with the ectopic expression of IFITM1. In addition, tumor development was significantly impaired in the absence of IFITM1 in vivo. Mechanistically, epidermal growth factor receptor/sex-determining region Y-box 2 (EGFR/SOX2) signaling axis was compromised in the absence of IFITM1, and the ectopic expression of SOX2 partially rescued the defects caused by IFITM1 depletion. More importantly, using 226 patient-derived samples, we demonstrate that a high level of IFITM1 expression is associated with a poor overall survival (OS) rate in adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these data suggest that IFITM1 is a poor prognostic marker of adenocarcinoma and an attractive target to develop novel therapeutics for NSCLC. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as the commonest type in liver cancer, is in urgent need for better treatment target due to its high mortality and poor prognosis. The involvement of angiogenesis in HCC has been identified by multiple studies, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been reported to regulate numerous cancers, including HCC. LncRNA-OR3A4 has been reported to exert oncogenic and angiogenetic functions in gastric cancer, but its role in HCC hasn't been elucidated. Present study aimed to uncover the biological role of OR3A4 in tumor progression and angiogenesis in HCC. The upregulation of OR3A4 in HCC tissues and cell lines and its prognostic significance were first identified. Loss-of-function assays, including CCK-8, transwell and tube formation assay, validated OR3A4 as a promoter for HCC progression and angiogenesis. The association of OR3A4 and AGGF1 with HCC and poor prognosis was identified by qRT-PCR and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Western blotting and spearman's correlation curve verified the effect of OR3A4 on AGGF1 level and their positive association. Rescue assays revealed that OR3A4 promoted cancer progression and angiogenesis in HCC via AGGF1/akt/mTOR. Together, present study revealed OR3A4 as a novel prognostic target for HCC, which regulated tumor progression and angiogenesis through AGGF1/akt/mTOR pathway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) is a ubiquitously expressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that has been found to be overexpressed in gastric intestinal-type adenocarcinoma. We first studied the relationship of BAP31 with 84 kinds of tumor-associated antigens and found that BAP31 can specifically interact with and regulate the proteasome degradation of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27 kip1 , which is one of the most frequently dysregulated tumor suppressor proteins in human cancers. Therefore, we screened antibodies against BAP31 from a human VH single-domain antibody library and expressed the antibodies intracellularly. It was found that one of the intrabodies (VH-D1) specifically inhibited p27 kip1 proteasome degradation, possibly by blocking the combination of BAP31 with p27 kip1 . VH-D1 displayed therapeutic effects, as it was able to reduce the growth of human gastric cancer (GC) cell xenografts in nude mice. This effect was due to inhibition of the proliferation and subsequent activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Thus, BAP31 is a potential target for the suppression of GC via an intrabody-based approach. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Background: The current study aimed to identify potential diagnostic and prognostic gene biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Methods: Microarray data of gene expression profiles of CRC from GEO and RNA-sequencing dataset of CRC from TCGA were downloaded. After screening overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by R software, functional enrichment analyses of the DEGs were performed using the DAVID database. Then, the STRING database and Cytoscape were used to construct a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and identify hub genes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to assess the diagnostic values of the hub genes. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to screen the potential prognostic genes. Kaplan-Meier curve and the time-dependent ROC curve were used to assess the prognostic values of the potential prognostic genes for CRC patients. Results: Integrated analysis of GEO and TCGA databases revealed 207 common DEGs in CRC. A PPI network consisted of 70 nodes and 170 edges were constructed and top 10 hub genes were identified. The area under curve (AUC) of the ROC curves of the hub genes were 0.900, 0.927, 0.869, 0.863, 0.980, 0.682, 0.903, 0.790, 0.995, and 0.989 for CCL19, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL11, CXCL12, GNG4, INSL5, NMU, PYY, and SST, respectively. A prognostic gene signature consisted of 9 genes including SLC4A4, NFE2L3, GLDN, PCOLCE2, TIMP1, CCL28, SCGB2A1, AXIN2, and MMP1 was constructed with a good performance in predicting overall survivals of CRC patients. The AUC of the time-dependent ROC curve was 0.741 for 5-year survival. Conclusion: The results in this study might provide some directive significance for further exploring the potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis prediction of CRC patients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 only explain the underlying genetic cause of about 10% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families. Because of cost-effectiveness, multigene panel testing is often performed even if the clinical utility of testing most of the genes remains questionable. The purpose of our study was to assess the contribution of rare, deleterious-predicted variants in DNA repair genes in familial breast cancer (BC) in a well-characterized and homogeneous population. We analyzed 113 DNA repair genes selected from either an exome sequencing or a candidate gene approach in the GENESIS study, which includes familial BC cases with no BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and having a sister with BC (N = 1,207), and general population controls (N = 1,199). Sequencing data were filtered for rare loss-of-function variants (LoF) and likely deleterious missense variants (MV). We confirmed associations between LoF and MV in PALB2, ATM and CHEK2 and BC occurrence. We also identified for the first time associations between FANCI, MAST1, POLH and RTEL1 and BC susceptibility. Unlike other associated genes, carriers of an ATM LoF had a significantly higher risk of developing BC than carriers of an ATM MV (OR LoF = 17.4 vs. OR MV = 1.6; p Het = 0.002). Hence, our approach allowed us to specify BC relative risks associated with deleterious-predicted variants in PALB2, ATM and CHEK2 and to add MAST1, POLH, RTEL1 and FANCI to the list of DNA repair genes possibly involved in BC susceptibility. We also highlight that different types of variants within the same gene can lead to different risk estimates. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "The complement system plays an important role in the innate and adaptive immunity, complement components mediate tumor cytolysis of antibody-based immunotherapy, and complement activation in the tumor microenvironment may promote tumor progression or inhibition, depending on the mechanism of action. In the present study, we conducted a two-phase analysis of two independently published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for associations between genetic variants in a complement-related immunity gene-set and overall survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The GWAS dataset from Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was used as the discovery, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression with false-positive report probability for multiple test corrections were performed to evaluate associations between 14,699 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 111 genes and survival of 1,185 NSCLC patients. The identified significant SNPs in a single-locus analysis were further validated with 984 NSCLC patients in the GWAS dataset from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility (HLCS) Study. The results showed that two independent, potentially functional SNPs in two genes (VWF rs73049469 and ITGB2 rs3788142) were significantly associated with NSCLC survival, with a combined hazards ratio (HR) of 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07–1.40, P = 0.002] and 1.16 (1.07–1.27, 6.45 × 10 −4 ), respectively. Finally, we performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and found that survival-associated genotypes of VWF rs73049469 were also significantly associated with mRNA expression levels of the gene. These results indicated that genetic variants of the complement-related immunity genes might be predictors of NSCLC survival, particularly for the short-term survival, possibly by modulating the expression of genes involved in the host immunity. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "In this study, MnCo 2 O 4 /Co 2 Mn 3 O 8 nanocomposites was synthesized for the first time by thermal decomposition of a natural complex involving Mn(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 and cochineal powder. Cochineal powder was dissolved in water and two aqua solutions of Mn(NO 3 ) 2 and Co(NO 3 ) 2 were added to it. The reaction of Co 2+ and Mn 2+ with functional groups of cochineal produced a stable complex. With heating this natural complex, MnCo 2 O 4 /Co 2 Mn 3 O 8 nanocomposites were successfully obtained. MTT cytotoxicity assay was conducted to determine the anti-cancer effect of the MnCo 2 O 4 /Co 2 Mn 3 O 8 nanocomposites synthesized against 4T1 cell lines. The mechanism of cell death was evaluated by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining methods, DAPI staining, flow cytometry. To know the effect of the MnCo 2 O 4 /Co 2 Mn 3 O 8 nanocomposites on oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured using the H 2 DCF-DA assay. The results show that, the MnCo 2 O 4 /Co 2 Mn 3 O 8 nanocomposites significantly reduced the survival percentage of the 4T1 cells of the murine invasive breast cancer with IC 50 of 2 mg/ml. The dominant mechanism of cell death was apoptosis, along with an increase in cellular oxidative stress. Therefore, the nanocomposites synthesized here can potential be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a novel mechanism in the expressional regulation of most human oncogenes. This process also is involved in cancer progression and prognosis. The potential of APA events as novel prognostic biomarkers has been suggested. CCND2 gene, which is overexpressed in various cancer tissues, tends to utilize the proximal APA site and produces a more prominent mRNA isoform with shorter 3’ untranslated region in the cancer cells. In this study, an ultrasensitive detection for CCND2 APA was successfully achieved using electrochemical biosensors constructed by gold nanoparticles-Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposite and p-sulfonated calix[8]arene functionalized reduced graphene oxide as nanocarriers. The detection ranges of CCND2-S and CCND2-L by the constructed biosensors were 10 −18 –10 −11 and 10 −17 –10 −11 M, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of CCND2-S was 0.176 aM (the RNA concentration at the single-cell level). To the best of our knowledge, this value was the lowest LOD among the reported non-coding RNA detection. In real samples, the results of the electrochemical detection using the constructed biosensors showed that the lung cancer cell H292 expressed considerably higher CCND2-S than CCND2-L. This result was in agreement with those obtained by RT-qPCR method. The electrochemical method had showed simpler operation, accurate quantitation, faster detection, and cheaper supplies compared with traditional methods. Therefore, this technology not only provides an ultrasensitive and feasible method for APA detection, but can also be applied in the prognosis and diagnosis of cancer progression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Structural based molecular docking approach revealed the findings of 2-(phenoxymethyl) -5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives. The compounds (7a-o) were synthesized and characterized well by using conventional methods. The compounds, 7b and 7m were reconfirmed through single crystal XRD analysis. The synthesized compounds (7a-o) were evaluated their antiproliferative activities against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453. Furthermore, Lipinski's rule of five and pharmacokinetic properties were predicted for the test compounds. These results demonstrate that the compounds 7b and 7d exhibit more potent cytotoxicity and 7d exhibits dose-dependent activity and reduced cell viability. Further, the mechanism of action for the induced apoptosis was observed through morphological changes and western blotting analysis. These findings may furnish the lead for further development. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer-related death due to its nonspecific characteristics compared to benign cases and poor prognosis after conventional therapies. Small peptides (SPs) demonstrated to have potential for diagnosis and prognosis were focused on in our study for the discovery of biomarkers that address these issues. Metabolic profiles of 15 SPs, including nine dipeptides and six tripeptides were acquired from plasma samples of 140 EOC and 158 benign ovarian tumor (BOT) patients. Partial least square discriminant analysis showed separations between EOC and BOT subjects of different age brackets. Hyp-Leu, Glu-Trp and Phe-Phe were selected as promising predictive SP-biomarkers for better EOC diagnosis compared to conventional biomarkers. Combined Hyp-Leu, Glu-Trp and CA125 presented an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.904, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.804 and 0.944, respectively. This finding suggested that the combination of these biomarkers performed much better than CA125 alone. Hyp-Leu and Gly-Phe-Trp showed significantly improved performances in the log-rank tests and Kaplan–Meier curves demonstrating their prognostic potential. All SP-biomarkers proved to have excellent stabilities at room temperature. Correlation network analysis implied latent conversions among amino acids, dipeptides and tripeptides during EOC. In conclusion, the selected SPs in combination with CA125 show profound promise for discriminating EOCs from BOTs and for predicting the progression after surgery, which provides invaluable information for clinicians in the precision diagnosis and treatment of EOC. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Early diagnosis and early treatment are important factors in reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis and mortality. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by the human body have great potential for use in clinical diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring for CRC. The aim of our study was to identify VOCs with high specificity and high sensitivity for CRC and to provide a method for early diagnosis of CRC. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was utilized to analyze metabolites in both the in vivo and in vitro experimental groups. In vivo, VOCs were analyzed in the blood of mice after cell inoculation and tumor resection. In vitro experiments were performed by comparing changes in VOCs in an HCoEpiC cell group, control group, SW620 cell group and Arsenic trioxide + SW620 group. We observed changes in VOCs in a series of CRC SW620 cells in vivo and in vitro. Among these changes, we found that the concentrations of 8 substances, including acetone, increased with tumor growth. Nine substances were found to be significantly elevated in the SW620 cancer cell group compared with the other groups. Only one substance was consumed by the tumor in both the in vivo and in vitro experiments. Our study showed that alkanes, lipids, alcohols, ketones, aldehyde, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane all existed at different levels in SW620 CRC cells compared to those in normal cells. We need more research to further confirm this hypothesis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "ST3Gal1 is a key sialyltransferase which adds α2,3-linked sialic acid to substrates and generates core 1 O-glycan structure. Upregulation of ST3Gal1 has been associated with worse prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, the protein substrates of ST3Gal1 implicated in tumor progression remain elusive. In our study, we demonstrated that ST3GAL1-silencing significantly reduced tumor growth along with a notable decrease in vascularity of MCF7 xenograft tumors. We identified vasorin (VASN) which was shown to bind TGF-β1, as a potential candidate that links ST3Gal1 to angiogenesis. LC-MS/MS analysis of VASN secreted from MCF7, revealed that more than 80% of its O-glycans are sialyl-3T and disialyl-T. ST3GAL1-silencing or desialylation of VASN by neuraminidase enhanced its binding to TGF-β1 by 2- to 3-fold and thereby dampening TGF-β1 signaling and angiogenesis, as indicated by impaired tube formation of HUVECs, suppressed angiogenesis gene expression and reduced activation of Smad2 and Smad3 in HUVEC cells. Examination of 114 fresh primary breast cancer and their adjacent normal tissues showed that the expression levels of ST3Gal1 and TGFB1 were high in tumor part and the expression of two genes was positively correlated. Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed a significantly shorter relapse-free survival for those with lower expression VASN, notably, the combination of low VASN with high ST3GAL1 yielded even higher risk of recurrence (p = 0.025, HR = 2.967, 95% CI = 1.14–7.67). Since TGF-β1 is known to transcriptionally activate ST3Gal1, our findings illustrated a feedback regulatory loop in which TGF-β1 upregulates ST3Gal1 to circumvent the negative impact of VASN. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "The development of cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) inhibitors is essential to validate cN-II as a potential target for the reversion of resistance to cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. We previously reported a fragment-based approach combined with molecular modelling, herein, the selected hit-fragments were used again in another computational approach based on the Ilib-diverse (a software enabling to build virtual molecule libraries through fragment based de novo design) program to generate a focused library of potential inhibitors. A molecular scaffold related to a previously identified compound was selected and led to a novel series of compounds. Ten out of nineteen derivatives showed 50–75% inhibition on the purified recombinant protein at 200 μM and among them three derivatives (12, 13 and 18) exhibited K i in the sub-millimolar range (0.84, 2.4 and 0.58 mM, respectively). Despite their only modest potency, the cN-II inhibitors showed synergistic effects when used in combination with cytotoxic purine nucleoside analogues on cancer cells. Therefore, these derivatives represent a family of non-nucleos(t)idic cN-II inhibitors with potential usefulness to overcome cancer drug resistance especially in hematological malignancies in which cN-II activity has been described as an important parameter. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "We have developed TiN nanoparticles (NPs) as a novel near-infrared-activated photothermal agent. The effect of nitridation temperature on the optical property and photothermal performance of the TiN NPs were investigated. The nanoparticles nitrided at 1000 °C presented a significant absorption along the whole biological spectral range (i.e., for wavelengths above 700 nm). After coated with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA), they exhibited well-defined spherical morphology with average size of ~ 50 nm. We also demonstrated their therapeutic efficacy against SW1990 pancreatic cancer cells. The results indicated that the PSS/PDDA-coated TiN NPs offered several advantages including high photothermal conversion efficiency (44.6%), high photothermal stability, broad spectral tunability, low cytotoxicity and facile synthesis process. These features make TiN NPs promising alternative for use as a photothermal agent in cancer photothermal treatment. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "The synthesis and evaluation of a series of N,N-bis-heterocyclic-methylamines 1 as isoazaerianin analogues are described. It was demonstrated that the replacement of the 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl A-ring present in CA-4, isoCA-4 and isoazaerianin by a quinoline or a quinazoline ring is possible and often beneficiary for a high level of cytotoxicity. We have also showed that a carbazole or an indole nucleus are very effective as B-rings in this series, leading to anti-cancer drugs 1 having a sub-nanomolar level of cytotoxicity (1a: IC 50 = 70 pM against HCT116 cells). 1a also display a high level of cytotoxicity against four other human cancer cells and inhibited tubulin assembly at a micromolar level. Moreover, at a concentration of 5 nM, 1a arrested the cellular cycle in G2/M phase of the cellular cycle and induced apoptosis of HCT116 cells. It was also showed that after few hours 1a at a concentration of 10 nM totally disrupted endothelial network formation on Matrigel. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes derived from azo-azomethine compounds were synthesized and characterized by a combination of magnetic susceptibility, elemental analyses, FTIR and UV–Visible spectroscopies. The characterized complexes were found to be mononuclear and the chelation of the ligands to the metal ions occurs through phenolic oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the azomethine group of the ligands. Solid state structure of 5 was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The electrochemical and photoluminescence properties of the synthesized compounds were also studied. In order to evaluate the ability of the compounds to inhibit cell proliferation, we treated MCF7 (breast cancer), PC3 (prostate cancer) and H2126 (lung cancer) cells with different concentrations of Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes bearing the azo-azomethine ligands. When nine Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes were assessed within themselves, our results highlighted that three compounds (8, 9 and 10) had the best inhibitory activity on all cell lines. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Estrogens play a key role in cellular proliferation of estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers (BCs). Suppression of estrogen production by competitive inhibitors of the enzyme aromatase (AIs) is currently one of the most effective therapies against ER + BC. Yet, the development of acquired resistance, after prolonged treatments with AIs, represents a clinical major concern. Serendipitous findings indicate that aromatase may be non-competitively inhibited by clinically employed drugs and/or industrial chemicals. Here, by performing in silico screening on two putative allosteric sites, molecular dynamics and free energy simulations, supported by enzymatic and cell-based assays, we identified five leads inhibiting the enzyme via a non-active site-directed mechanism. This study provides new compelling evidences for the existence of an allosteric regulation of aromatase and for the possibility of exploiting it to modulate estrogens biosynthesis. Such modulation can aptly reduce side effects caused by the complete estrogen deprivation therapy, and, possibly, delay/avoid the onset of resistance. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Gene therapy is a promising alternative that ensures effective treatment and cure for cancer. Here, we report graphene-reinforced chitosan (CS) construct based non-viral vector for tumor-targeted gene therapy. The therapeutic gene, pDNA-TNF-α was loaded on to chitosan-carboxylated graphene oxide (CS-CGO) construct via electrostatic interaction. The pDNA-TNF-α-CS-CGO thus obtained was further passivated with 4,7,10-trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine for protecting the vector from the mononuclear phagocyte system that contributes to the prolongation of circulation half-life. The surface passivated carrier (PEG-pDNA-TNF-α-CS-CGO) then festooned with the folic acid derived carbon dots (C-dots) for targeting folate receptors that are overexpressed in most of the cancer cells. The results of TEM images and zeta potential values ensured the occurrence of desired changes in each stage of C-dot-PEG-pDNA-TNF-α-CS-CGO formulation. After 14 days of incubation, the anti-angiogenesis effect was observed for final formulation in the chorioallantoic membrane. The results of in vitro gene expression study in cancer cell line show a comparatively higher transfection efficacy of the developed system (C-dot-PEG-pDNA-TNF-α-CS-CGO) than pDNA-TNF-α. The efficiency of the developed gene delivery system was further confirmed using a developed and validated artificial tumor cell apparatus. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the present study a series of dione-thiophenol conjugates was prepared and evaluated against nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. MTT assay showed that compound 4a reduced proliferation of C666-1 and CNE-1 cells to 26 and 24%, respectively at 10 μmol/l concentration. Flow cytometry revealed that increasing the concentration of compound 4a from 2 to 10 μmol/l increased the proportion of early apoptotic C666-1 cells from 2.76 to 69.43%. A significant (P < 0.001) decrease in the expression of S100P was caused by compound 4a. In compound 4a treated C666-1 cells the expression of RAGE, EGFR, CD44, MMP2 and MMP9 was markedly decreased. In summary, compound 4a inhibits nasopharyngeal cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis through down-regulation of S100P. Moreover, compound 4a also decreases MMP-2, MMP-9, EGFR, CD44 and RAGE expression in nasopharyngeal cancer cells. Thus, compound 4a can be investigated further as a drug candidate for the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer. © 2019",
