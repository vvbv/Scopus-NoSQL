    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE Spontaneous preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. It is unclear if a cervical pessary can reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. OBJECTIVE To test whether in asymptomatic women with singleton pregnancies and no prior spontaneous preterm birth but with short cervical length on transvaginal ultrasound, use of a cervical pessary would reduce the rate of spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized clinical trial conducted from March 1, 2016, to May 25, 2017, at a single center in Italy. Asymptomatic women with singleton gestations, no previous spontaneous preterm births, and cervical lengths of 25 mm or less at 18 weeks 0 days to 23 weeks 6 days of gestation were eligible. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either cervical pessary (n = 150) or no pessary (n = 150). The pessary was removed between 37 weeks 0 days and 37 weeks 6 days of gestation or earlier if clinically indicated. The control group received standard care. For cervical length of 20 mm or shorter, women in both groups were prescribed vaginal progesterone, 200 mg/d, until 36 weeks 6 days of gestation. No bed rest or activity restriction was recommended. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes were adverse events. RESULTS Among 300 women who were randomized (mean age, 29 [SD, 6.3] years; mean gestational age, 22 [SD, 1.3] weeks), 100% completed the trial. The primary end point occurred in significantly fewer women in the pessary group. During follow-up, the pessary group had a higher rate of increased or new vaginal discharge. No. (%) Between-Group Pessary Group Control Group Difference, % Relative Risk (n = 150) (n = 150) (95% CI) (95% CI) Primary outcome Spontaneous preterm 11 (7.3) 23 (15.3) ?8.0 (?15.7 to ?0.4) 0.48 (0.24-0.95) birth <34 wk Adverse events Vaginal discharge 130 (86.7) 69 (46.0) 40.7 (30.1 to 50.3) 1.88 (1.57-2.27) CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women without prior spontaneous preterm birth who had asymptomatic singleton pregnancies and short transvaginal cervical length, use of a cervical pessary, compared with no pessary use, resulted in a lower rate of spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation. The results of this single-center, nonblinded study among selected pregnant women require confirmation in multicenter clinical trials. © 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Increasing numbers of elderly patients are undergoing long-term dialysis. However, the role of dialysis in survival and quality of life is unclear, and poor outcomes may be associated with comorbidities rather than with age only. The initiation of unplanned dialysis in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been reported to be associated with poor survival. We evaluated patient and practice factors associated with poor survival. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 90 consecutive elderly patients (≥75 years) with CKD initiated on long-term dialysis at our renal unit between October 2010 and February 2014. Six patients were excluded; data from 84 remaining patients (≥75 years) with end-stage renal disease undergoing planned or unplanned dialysis were analyzed. Patients were followed up until death or January 2015. Patient factors such as age at initiation of dialysis and comorbidities (i.e., diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease [IHD], peripheral vascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cognitive dysfunction) were analyzed. Practice factors such as planned or unplanned initiation of dialysis were compared in relation to survival outcomes. \"Unplanned dialysis\" was defined as a patient with known CKD stage 4 or 5 who had not been evaluated by a nephrologist in the 3 months before dialysis initiation. Results: The average age at dialysis initiation was 81.5 ± 4.5 years), serum albumin level was 24.8 ± 6 g/L, body mass index was 22.5 ± 4.8 kg/m 2 , and glycated hemoglobin A1c level was 6.3 ± 1.3. Overall, 51 (61%) and 33 (39%) patients underwent unplanned and planned dialysis, respectively. On univariate analysis, the presence of IHD, peripheral vascular disease, ≥3 comorbidities, and unplanned initiation of dialysis were significantly related to death. On multivariate analysis, unplanned start of dialysis, ischemic heart diseases and peripheral vascular disease remained significant. Survival rates at 3 and 12 months were 38.6% vs. 90.9% and 14.4% vs. 73.6% for unplanned vs. planned dialysis, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Unplanned dialysis was significantly associated with greater mortality. Conclusions: In elderly dialysis patients, unplanned start of dialysis was associated with poor survival. Patient characteristics such as associated peripheral vascular disease and IHD were associated with poor survival. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Research has shown that sexual minorities (SMs) (e.g. lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals), compared to their heterosexual counterparts, may engage in riskier health behaviors, are at higher risk of some adverse health outcomes, and are more likely to experience reduced health care access and utilization. However, few studies have examined how the interplay between race and sexual orientation impacts a range of health measures in a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population. Methods: To address these gaps in the literature, we sought to investigate associations between sexual orientation identity and health/healthcare outcomes among U.S. women and men within and across racial/ethnic groups. Using 2013-2015 National Health Interview Survey data (N = 91,913) we employed Poisson regression with robust variance to directly estimate prevalence ratios (PR) comparing health and healthcare outcomes among SMs of color to heterosexuals of color and white heterosexuals, stratified by gender and adjusting for potential confounders. Results: The sample consisted of 52% women, with approximately 2% of each sex identifying as SMs. Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, white (PR = 1.25 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.45]) and black (1.54 [1.07, 2.20]) SM women were more likely to report heavy drinking. Hispanic/Latino SM women and men were more likely to experience short sleep duration compared to white heterosexual women (1.33 [1.06, 1.66]) and men (1.51 [1.21, 1.90). Black SM women had a much higher prevalence of stroke compared to black heterosexual women (3.25 [1.63, 6.49]) and white heterosexual women (4.51 [2.16, 9.39]). White SM women were more likely than white heterosexual women to be obese (1.31 [1.15, 1.48]), report cancer (1.40 [1.07, 1.82]) and report stroke (1.91 [1.16, 3.15]. White (2.41 [2.24, 2.59]), black (1.40[1.20, 1.63]), and Hispanic/Latino SM (2.17 [1.98, 2.37]) men were more likely to have been tested for HIV than their heterosexual counterparts. Conclusions: Sexual minorities had a higher prevalence of some poor health behaviors, health outcomes, and healthcare access issues, and these disparities differed across racial groups. Further research is needed to investigate potential pathways, such as discrimination, in the social environment that may help explain the relationship between sexual orientation and health. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prospective studies have shown that 80% of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) cases progress to chronic infection; approximately 10-20% of patients with these conditions will develop liver cirrhosis within 2 to 3 decades, and 1-5% will develop liver cancer. Some studies have indicated that the rs738409 polymorphism of the PNPLA3 gene is associated with steatosis and the progression of advanced fibrosis. This study assessed the contribution of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism with regard to the steatosis and degree of liver fibrosis in Brazilian patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C. Methods: A total of 290 patients were evaluated at the Clinics Hospital of the School of Medicine, University of São Paulo, between 2010 and 2015. The inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years and positive anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA tests. The participants were evaluated based on medical consultation, blood tests, and liver biopsies conducted before specific antiviral therapies were applied. The associations between the rs738409 PNPLA3 gene polymorphism and steatosis and advanced fibrosis were tested under a recessive inheritance model using logistic regression analysis, including age, gender, BMI, ethnicity/color, HOMA-IR, alcohol intake, HCV genotype 3, and the rs58542926 TM6SF2 gene polymorphism as covariates. Results: The mean age of the patients was 54.9 years old (range, 28 to 82 years), and 124 (42.8%) patients were male, 226 (77.9%) were white, 43 (14.8%) were pardo, and 21 (7.2%) were black Brazilians. Of the patients included in this study, 133 (45.9%) presented with the CC genotype, 63 (21.7%) with the CG genotype, and 94 (32.4%) with the GG genotype of the PNPLA3 gene I148M variant. We observed that the associations between PNPLA3 rs738409 GG genotype and steatosis was significant (OR: 2.16; 95% CI 1.26-3.72). The same genotype was associated to advanced fibrosis too (OR:2.64; 95% CI 1.26-5.53). Conclusions: Associations between the rs738409 polymorphism of the PNPLA3 gene genotype GG and hepatic steatosis and advanced fibrosis were observed. Studies are still needed to clarify the influence of these polymorphisms on hepatic steatosis and degree of fibrosis among individuals diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) leaves and Japanese apricot (Mume fructus) fruit are traditionally recognized to be safe herbs broadly used for food and medicinal purposes in Southeast Asia. Our group previously explored their antiplatelet effects. This study was designed to confirm inhibition effects of PM21 (a 2:1 mixture of bamboo leaf extract and Japanese apricot fruit extract) on platelet aggregation and evaluate its potency to use as an herbal remedy to prevent and/or treat the diseases caused by platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Methods: Washed platelets were prepared and platelet aggregation was induced by adding 5 μg/mL collagen. Anti-platelet effects of PM21 (75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg for ex vivo and in vivo assays, and 50, 100, 200 μg/mL for in vitro assays) were evaluated. In ex vivo assays, PM21 was orally administered to rats daily after overnight fasting for 3 days and blood was collected 1 h after the final treatment. In vivo antithrombotic effect of PM21 was observed from a carrageenan induced mouse tail thrombosis model. Results: In ex vivo assay, PM21 inhibited platelet aggregation significantly. PM21 showed a strong antithrombotic effect by reducing significantly the length of mouse tail thrombus. PM21 increased intracellular cAMP level and reduced the release of ATP, TXA2, and serotonin. PM21 also reduced intracellular concentration of calcium ion, fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3, and phosphorylation of ERK2, p38, PLCγ2, and PI3 K. Conclusions: PM21 showed remarkable inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Its inhibitory function seems to influence on GPVI binding to its ligand and subsequent initiation of a signaling cascade that involves activation of effector proteins and secretion of effector molecules, such as ATP, TXA2, serotonin, and Ca2+. PM21 also appears to exert its anti-platelet effect by deactivation of ERKs activation pathway as well as inhibition of fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an initial factor in many kidney disorders. Pre- and intra-renal AKI biomarkers have recently been reported. Recovery from AKI by herbal medicine has rarely been reported. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the dose- and time-dependent effects of herbal medicines to protect against AKI in cisplatin-induced human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells by assessing the activities of high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Methods: Proximal tubular HK-2 cell lines were treated with either 400 μM of cisplatin for 6 h or 10 μM of cisplatin for 24 h and then exposed to ten types of single herbal medicines, including Nelumbo nymphaea (NY) at a dose of 100 μg/mL. The AKI biomarkers HMGB1, NGAL and KIM-1 were repeatedly measured by an ELISA assay at 2, 4, and 6 h in the group treated with 400 μM of cisplatin to confirm necrotic cell death and at 6, 24, and 48 h in the group treated with 10 μM of cisplatin to examine apoptotic cell death. Recovery confirm was conducted through in vivo study using ICR mice for 3 day NY or Paeonia suffruticosa intake. Results: Cisplatin treatment at a concentration of 10 μM decreased cell viability. Treatment with 400 μM of cisplatin reduced HMBG1 activity and resulted in lactate dehydrogenase release. In longer exposure durations (up to 48 h), NGAL and KIM-1 exhibited activity from 24 h onward. Additionally, NY treatment resulted in an approximately 50% change in all three biomarkers. The time-dependent profiles of HMGB1, NGAL and KIM-1 activities up to 48 h were notably different; HMGB1 exhibited a 7-fold change at 6 h, and NGAL and KIM-1 exhibited 1.7-fold changes at 24 h, respectively. Consistently, serum and urine NGAL and KIM-1 activities were all reduced in ICR mice. Conclusions: Several single herbal medicines, including NY, have a potential as effectors of AKI due to their ability to inhibit the activation of HMGB1, NGAL and KIM-1 in an in vitro AKI-mimicked condition and simple in vivo confirm. Furthermore, an in vivo proof-of-concept study is needed. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Previous studies have reported that Ile462Val polymorphism in the gene Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is associated with the risk of cervical cancer, but inconsistent results have emerged. Hence, we performed this updated and cumulative meta-analysis to ascertain a more accurate association between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and risk of cervical cancer. Methods: Studies involving the CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism associated with cervical cancer risk were searched from the databases of PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The strength of correlation was evaluated through calculating summary odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Subgroup analyses according to ethnicity, source of control and HWE were completed to further explore specific association between the polymorphism and the cancer risk. Results: Altogether, 11 eligible case-control studies were ultimately encompassed into the current meta-analysis, with 1,932 patients and 2,039 healthy controls. The total analysis revealed a borderline relationship between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and cervical cancer risk in general population. Interestingly, after subgroup analyses based on ethnicity and source of control, the polymorphism increased the susceptibility of cervical cancer in Caucasian (G vs. A: OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.24-3.13; GG vs. AA: OR = 3 .24, 95% CI = 1.24-8.46; GA vs. AA: OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.25-2.10; GA+GG vs. AA: OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.16-2.43; GG vs. AA+GA: OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.05-7.10) and population-based (G vs. A: OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.10-2.02; GA vs. AA: OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.20-1.67; GA+GG vs. AA: OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.19-1.64) groups. Conclusion: The CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism may enhance the susceptibility to cervical cancer in Caucasian females. © 2017 Wang, Wang, Liu, Jin, Fang and Ren.",

    "Abstract": "This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Diagnostic test accuracy). The objectives are as follows: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the identification of lymph node involvement in patients with early stage cervical cancer (Stage IA2 to IIA). We will first explore the impact of major factors for heterogeneity such as tumour size, FIGO stage and timing between application, detection of tracers, tracer substance used, surgical approach, experience of the operator and use of histological ultra-staging techniques. Then, we may consider other factors such as previous treatment to the cervix (including conisation), patient age and body mass index, as these have previously been suggested as possible factors associated with success or failure of sentinel node identification (Sinno 2014; Tanner 2015; Wuntakal 2015). © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

    "Abstract": "Background: Obesity is linked to poor disease outcomes in breast cancer patients. However, this link was mostly based on body weight or BMI rather than body-fat. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between body-fat gain and disease progression in Taiwanese women after breast cancer surgery and how this relationship is influenced by menopausal status. Methods: Body fat percentage was measured 1 day before and 6 months after surgery in 131 women with stages 0-III breast cancer. Disease outcomes (metastasis and death) were assessed by chart review and telephone contact 7 to 8 years after diagnosis. These data were analyzed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis. Results: The percentage of women with over 5% gain in body-fat was 56% for premenopausal and 42% for postmenopausal. Rates of distant metastasis and all-cause mortality were 17.6 and 9.9%, respectively over the follow-up period. Distant metastases were predicted in postmenopausal but not premenopausal women with breast cancer by increased body fat percentage (HR = 1.3, p = 0.035), after controlling other potential covariates, including disease severity, estrogen receptor expression, progesterone receptors expression, age, and exercise habit before diagnosis. Survival was not significantly associated with body-fat percentage gains. Conclusions: Our results suggest that increased body fat percentage 6 months after breast surgery is an important predictor of distant metastasis in postmenopausal Taiwanese women with breast cancer. Clinicians may need to measure patients' body fat periodically. Our findings should be validated in studies with a longer follow-up time. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Low income and uninsured individuals often have lower adherence to cancer screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. Health fairs are a common community outreach strategy used to provide cancer-related health education and services. Methods: This study was a process evaluation of seven health fairs focused on cancer screening across the U.S. We conducted key-informant interviews with the fair coordinator and conducted baseline and follow-up surveys with fair participants to describe characteristics of participants as well as their experiences. We collected baseline data with participants at the health fairs and telephone follow-up surveys 6 months following the fair. Results: Attendance across the seven health fairs ranged from 41 to 212 participants. Most fairs provided group or individual education, print materials and cancer screening during the event. Overall, participants rated health fairs as very good and participants reported that the staff was knowledgeable and that they liked the materials distributed. After the fairs, about 60% of participants, who were reached at follow-up, had read the materials provided and had conversations with others about cancer screening, and 41% talked to their doctors about screening. Based on findings from evaluation including participant data and coordinator interviews, we describe 6 areas in planning for health fairs that may increase their effectiveness. These include: 1) use of a theoretical framework for health promotion to guide educational content and activities provided, 2) considering the community characteristics, 3) choosing a relevant setting, 4) promotion of the event, 5) considerations of the types of services to deliver, and 6) evaluation of the health fair. Conclusions: The events reported varied in reach and the participants represented diverse races and lower income populations overall. Most health fairs offered education, print materials and onsite cancer screening. Participants reported general satisfaction with these events and were motivated through their participation to read educational materials or discuss screening with providers. Public health professionals can benefit from this process evaluation and recommendations for designing and evaluating health fairs. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Determining whether an asymptomatic individual with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels below 20 ng ml-1 has prostate cancer in the absence of definitive, biopsy-based evidence continues to present a significant challenge to clinicians who must decide whether such individuals with low PSA values have prostate cancer. Herein, we present an advanced computational data extraction approach which can identify the presence of prostate cancer in men with PSA levels &lt; 20 ng ml-1 on the basis of peripheral blood immune cell profiles that have been generated using multi-parameter flow cytometry. Statistical analysis of immune phenotyping datasets relating to the presence and prevalence of key leukocyte populations in the peripheral blood, as generated from individuals undergoing routine tests for prostate cancer (including tissue biopsy) using multi-parametric flow cytometric analysis, was unable to identify significant relationships between leukocyte population profiles and the presence of benign disease (no prostate cancer) or prostate cancer. By contrast, a Genetic Algorithm computational approach identified a subset of five flow cytometry features (CD8+CD45RA-CD27-CD28- (CD8+ Effector Memory cells); CD4+CD45RA-CD27-CD28- (CD4+ Terminally Differentiated Effector Memory Cells re-expressing CD45RA); CD3-CD19+ (B cells); CD3+CD56+CD8+CD4+ (NKT cells)) from a set of twenty features, which could potentially discriminate between benign disease and prostate cancer. These features were used to construct a prostate cancer prediction model using the k-Nearest-Neighbor classification algorithm. The proposed model, which takes as input the set of flow cytometry features, outperformed the predictive model which takes PSA values as input. Specifically, the flow cytometry-based model achieved Accuracy = 83.33%, AUC = 83.40%, and optimal ROC points of FPR = 16.13%, TPR = 82.93%, whereas the PSA-based model achieved Accuracy = 77.78%, AUC = 76.95%, and optimal ROC points of FPR = 29.03%, TPR = 82.93%. Combining PSA and flow cytometry predictors achieved Accuracy = 79.17%, AUC = 78.17% and optimal ROC points of FPR = 29.03%, TPR = 85.37%. The results demonstrate the value of computational intelligence-based approaches for interrogating immunophenotyping datasets and that combining peripheral blood phenotypic profiling with PSA levels improves diagnostic accuracy compared to using PSA test alone. These studies also demonstrate that the presence of cancer is reflected in changes in the peripheral blood immune phenotype profile which can be identified using computational analysis and interpretation of complex flow cytometry datasets. © 2017 Cosma, McArdle, Reeder, Foulds, Hood, Khan and Pockley.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the health-related quality of life (QOL) of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) according to tumor location. The sample consisted of 27 patients with primary SCC in the oral cavity (n = 15), pharynx (n = 7), and larynx (n = 5) who were undergoing cancer treatment at the Cancer Hospital of Londrina, regardless of age, sex, clinical stage, and type of antineoplastic treatment. Health-related QOL was evaluated using the 30-item Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), the 35-item Head and Neck Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-HN35), and the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL). These questionnaires were administered individually to each patient before ambulatory care. Sociodemographic data (age and sex) and clinical data (T stage, tumor location, and type of antineoplastic treatment) were collected from the patients' medical records. Scores were compared according to tumor location using the chi-squared test and one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05). No score differed significantly according to tumor location. It can be concluded that the health-related QOL of patients with SCC was not influenced by tumor location.",

    "Abstract": "Since pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed in a late state of cancer development, diagnostic opportunities allowing early disease detection are highly sought after. As such, cancer expression of claudin proteins is markedly dysregulated, making it an attractive target for molecular imaging like positron emission tomography (PET). Claudins are a family of transmembrane proteins that have a pivotal role as members of the tight junctions. In particular, claudin-3 and claudin-4 are frequently overexpressed in pancreatic cancer.18F-Labeled claudin selective peptides would provide access to a novel kind of imaging tools for pancreatic cancer. In this work we describe the synthesis of the first18F-labeled probes potentially suitable for PET imaging of claudin-4 expression. These probes were prepared using oxime ligation of 5-[18F]fluoro-5-deoxyribose (5-[18F]FDR) to claudin selective peptides. As a proof-of-principle, one of them, 5-[18F]FDR-Clone 27, was isolated in &gt;98% radiochemical purity and in 15% radiochemical yield (EOB) within 98 min, and with a molar activity of 4.0 GBq/µmol (for 30 MBq of tracer). Moreover, we present first biological data for the prepared 5-FDR-conjugates. These tracers could pave the way for an early diagnosis of pancreatic tumor, and thus improve the outcome of anticancer therapy. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "Long term exposure to trace metals in various media is of great concern for people living in known pollution sources, such as mining and industrial activities. Health risk assessment and human hair analysis can provide important information for local environmental management. Information on distribution characteristics of trace metals in soil, water, sediment, air, local crops, and human hair from a typical mining area in southern China was collected. Results show there exists severely trace metal contamination in soil, sediment, and air. Arsenic and Pb contents in the local children’s hair are higher than the upper reference values, and the accumulation of residents’ hair trace metals shows great correlation with the ingestion and inhalation pathways. Arsenic contributes 52.27% and 58.51% to the total non-cancer risk of adults and children, respectively. The cancer risk of Cd in adults and children are 4.66 and 3.22 times higher than the safe level, respectively. Ingestion exposure pathway of trace metals largely contributes to the total non-cancer and cancer effect. The metals As, Cd, and Pb are major risk sources and pollutants that should be given priority for management, and ingestion pathway exposure to trace metals through soil and crops should be controlled. © 2017 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "Autophagy and autophagy-related genes (Atg) have been attributed prominent roles in tumorigenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Extracellular vesicles called exosomes are also implicated in cancer metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that exosome production is strongly reduced in cells lacking Atg5 and Atg16L1, but this is independent of Atg7 and canonical autophagy. Atg5 specifically decreases acidification of late endosomes where exosomes are produced, disrupting the acidifying V1V0-ATPase by removing a regulatory component, ATP6V1E1, into exosomes. The effect of Atg5 on exosome production promotes the migration and in vivo metastasis of orthotopic breast cancer cells. These findings uncover mechanisms controlling exosome release and identify means by which autophagy-related genes can contribute to metastasis in autophagy-independent pathways. Guo et al. demonstrate that, independent of canonical autophagy, Atg5 and Atg16L1 de-acidify multivesicular bodies via V1V0-ATPase control to induce exosome release and promote cancer cell metastasis. This reveals mechanisms governing exosome release and suggests that some effects of Atg5 and Atg16L1 in disease are mediated by exosomes rather than autophagy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To evaluate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms of enolase superfamily member 1 (ENOSF1) and capecitabine related toxic reactions. METHODS Peripheral venous blood was collected from 62 patients with colorectal cancer who were treated with capecitabine alone or combined with chemotherapy. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral venous blood to genotype ENOSF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs2612091, IVS10-61C&gt;T, IVS10- 60G&gt;A, and rs1059394 by sequencing. The toxic reactions of capecitabine were recorded, and their relationship with different genotypes was compared. RESULTS According to the level of toxic reactions, the patients were divided into two groups: patients with grade 0-1 toxicities and those with grade 2-4 toxicities. ENOSF1 genotypes were divided into a dominant model and a recessive model. In the dominant model, the risk of grade 2-4 hand-foot syndrome in patients with IVS10- 60G&gt;A GG genotype was significantly higher than that in patients with AG/AA genotype (χ2 = 5.421, P = 0.020, OR = 4.364, 95%CI: 1.217-15.641). In the recessive model, the risk of grade 2-4 diarrhea in patients with IVS10-61C&gt;T TT genotype was significantly higher than that in patients with CC/CT genotype (Fisher’s exact test: P = 0.817, OR = 0.108, 95%CI: 0.015-0.788). CONCLUSION The IVS10-61C&gt;T and IVS10-60G&gt;A loci of ENOSF1 gene are expected to be used as genetic markers to predict the therapeutic safety of capecitabine treatment. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Cells of multi-cellular organisms evolve toward uni-cellularity in the form of cancer and, if humans intervene, continue to evolve in cell culture. During this process, gene dosage relationships may evolve in novel ways to cope with the new environment and may regress back to the ancestral uni-cellular state. In this context, the evolution of sex chromosomes vis-a-vis autosomes is of particular interest. Here, we report the chromosomal evolution in ~ 600 cancer cell lines. Many of them jettisoned either Y or the inactive X; thus, free-living male and female cells converge by becoming ‘de-sexualized’. Surprisingly, the active X often doubled, accompanied by the addition of one haploid complement of autosomes, leading to an X:A ratio of 2:3 from the extant ratio of 1:2. Theoretical modeling of the frequency distribution of X:A karyotypes suggests that the 2:3 ratio confers a higher fitness and may reflect aspects of sex chromosome evolution. © Xu et al.",

    "Abstract": "Jay Amin hydroxamic acid (JAHA; N8-ferrocenylN1-hydroxy-octanediamide) is a ferrocene-containing analogue of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). JAHA's cytotoxic activity on MDA-MB231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells at 72 h has been previously demonstrated with an IC50 of 8.45 μM. JAHA's lethal effect was found linked to perturbations of cell cycle, mitochondrial activity, signal transduction, and autophagy mechanisms. To glean novel insights on how MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells respond to the cytotoxic effect induced by JAHA, and to compare the biological effect with the related compound SAHA, we have employed a combination of differential display-PCR, proteome analysis, and COMET assay techniques and shown some differences in the molecular signature profiles induced by exposure to either HDACis. In particular, in contrast to the more numerous and diversified changes induced by SAHA, JAHA has shown a more selective impact on expression of molecular signatures involved in antioxidant activity and DNA repair. Besides expanding the biological knowledge of the effect exerted by the modifications in compound structures on cell phenotype, the molecular elements put in evidence in our study may provide promising targets for therapeutic interventions on TNBCs. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Periocular melanoma is a rare but often deadly malignancy that arises in the uvea (commonest origin), conjunctiva or orbit (rarest primary site). Melanoma accounts for 5-10% of metastatic/secondary orbital malignancies, but only a tiny proportion of primary orbital neoplasia. Primary orbital melanoma (POM) is exceedingly rare, with approximately 50 cases reported to date. Methods: All patients seen in the orbital unit at a tertiary referral hospital (1991-2016) with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of POM were identified from a diagnostic database and were studied. The case notes, imaging, surgical approach, and histology were reviewed. Results: Thirteen patients (five male; 38%) presented with isolated malignant melanoma of the orbit, for which no other primary site was identified at presentation or during an average follow-up of 44 months (median 22; range 0-13 years). The patients presented between the ages of 40 and 84 years (mean 55.5; median 48 years) and typically gave a short history of rapidly increasing proptosis and eyelid swelling. On the basis of history, a malignant lesion was suspected in most patients and all underwent incisional biopsy, with debulking of the mass in 10 (77%) patients, and skin-sparing exenteration in 3/13 (23%). Ten patients underwent orbital radiotherapy and the survival to date ranged from 9 months to 14 years (mean 55 months; median 23 months); two patients received solely palliative care for widespread disease and one patient refused orbital radiotherapy. Five of the 13 (38%) patients died from the disease. Discussion: POM is a very rare malignancy, but clinical analysis of this cohort gives insight into disease presentation and prognosis. The tumor typically presents with a rapidly progressive, well-defined mass that is, in some cases, amenable to macroscopically intact excision. Unusual for malignant melanoma, some of these patients can show an unusually long period of quiescent disease after surgical debulking and radiotherapy. © 2017 Rose, Luthert, Jayasena, Verity and Rose.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The global incidence of melanoma has been increasing faster than any other form of cancer. New therapies offer exciting prospects for improved survival, but the development of resistance is a major problem and there remains a need for additional effective melanoma therapy. Platinum compounds, such as cisplatin, are the most effective chemotherapeutics for a number of major cancers, but are ineffective on metastatic melanoma. They cause monofunctional adducts and intrastrand crosslinks that are repaired by nucleotide excision repair, as well as the more toxic interstrand crosslinks that are repaired by a combination of nuclease activity and homologous recombination. Methods: We investigated the mechanism of melanoma resistance to cisplatin using a panel of melanoma and control cell lines. Cisplatin-induced changes in levels of the key homologous recombination protein RAD51 and compensatory changes in translesion synthesis DNA polymerases were identified by western blotting and qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to compare the cell cycle and DNA damage response and the induction of apoptosis in cisplatin-treated melanoma and control cells. Ectopic expression of a tagged form of RAD51 and siRNA knockdown of translesion synthesis DNA polymerase zeta were used to investigate the mechanism that allowed cisplatin-treated melanoma cells to continue to replicate. Results: We have identified and characterised a novel DNA damage response mechanism in melanoma. Instead of increasing levels of RAD51 on encountering cisplatin-induced interstrand crosslinks during replication, melanoma cells shut down RAD51 synthesis and instead boost levels of translesion synthesis DNA polymerase zeta to allow replication to proceed. This response also resulted in synthetic lethality to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Conclusions: This unusual DNA damage response may be a more appropriate strategy for an aggressive and rapidly growing tumour like melanoma that enables it to better survive chemotherapy, but also results in increased sensitivity of cultured melanoma cells to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) cooperates with Hedgehog (HH) signaling, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we provide genetic, biochemical, and pharmacologic evidence that MTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent translation is a prerequisite for HH signaling. The genetic loss of mTORC1 function inhibited HH signaling-driven growth of the cerebellum and medulloblastoma. Inhibiting translation or mTORC1 blocked HH signaling. Depleting 4EBP1, an mTORC1 target that inhibits translation, alleviated the dependence of HH signaling on mTORC1. Consistent with this, phosphorylated 4EBP1 levels were elevated in HH signaling-driven medulloblastomas in mice and humans. In mice, an mTORC1 inhibitor suppressed medulloblastoma driven by a mutant SMO that is inherently resistant to existing SMO inhibitors, prolonging the survival of the mice. Our study reveals that mTORC1-mediated translation is a key component of HH signaling and an important target for treating medulloblastoma and other cancers driven by HH signaling. Wu et al. show that Hedgehog (HH) signaling promotes protein synthesis via a non-canonical, mTORC1/4EBP1-dependent pathway and that mTORC1/4EBP1-dependent translation is a prerequisite for canonical HH signaling. They show further that inhibition of mTORC1 signaling suppresses HH-dependent cerebellar growth and the development of HH-driven medulloblastoma. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Pistachios are rich in health-promoting bioactive compounds such as B vitamins, γ-tocopherol, polyphenols and dietary fiber, which could contribute to the reduction of colon cancer risk in terms of chemoprevention (Fischer, S.; Glei, M. Health-Potential of Nuts. Ernaehrungs Umsch. Int. 2013, 60, 206–215.). Since pistachios are often consumed roasted, the present study aims at investigating the influence of different roasting conditions (RC) on potential chemopreventive effects of pistachios in colon adenoma cells such as growth and apoptosis, genotoxic- and anti-genotoxic effects and modulation of gene expression of detoxifying enzymes (CAT, SOD2, GPx1, and GSTP1). Fermentation supernatants (FS) were obtained from raw and roasted (RC1 = 141◦C/25 min, RC2 = 160◦C/15 min and RC3 = 185◦C/21 min) pistachios after in vitro fermentation. FS of pistachios significantly reduced LT97 cell growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Compared to the blank control, pistachio FS (2.5%) led to a significant average reduction of H2O2-induced DNA damage (1.5-fold). Levels of CAT mRNA were significantly increased (1.3-fold, on average for 5% FS). Pistachio FS (5%) significantly increased the number of early apoptotic cells (up to 2.1-fold) and levels of caspase-3 activities (up to 6.9-fold). The present results confirm a chemopreventive potential of pistachios, which is mediated by growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis and anti-genotoxic effects, as well as induction of CAT. These effects remain mostly unaffected by roasting. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To assess the clinical value of combined detection of four common tumor markers in benign and malignant hepatobiliary system diseases. METHODS Two hundred and seventy patients with benign and malignant hepatobiliary system diseases (hepatolithiasis, liver abscess, choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma) treated at our hospital from February 2015 to February 2017 were included. The levels of a-fetoprotein (AFP), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen19-9 (CA19-9), and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) were detected in all patients by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and their value in disease diagnosis and curative effect monitoring was assessed. RESULTS There was no significant difference in serum levels of tumor markers between the normal control group and the benign liver disease group (P > 0.05). The levels of tumor markers in the malignant hepatobiliary disease group were significantly higher than those in the benign liver disease group (P < 0.05). In malignant liver diseases, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of AFP were the highest among all single detections; compared with single detection, the sensitivity of combined detection was increased significantly (P < 0.05), but the specificity and accuracy were decreased (P > 0.05). In malignant biliary diseases, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CA19-9 were the highest among all single detections; compared with single detection, the sensitivity of combined detection was increased significantly (P < 0.05), but the specificity and accuracy were decreased (P > 0.05). Compared with the values before treatment, the levels of AFP, CEA, CA19-9, and CA125 in patients with malignant hepatobiliary diseases significantly decreased after treatment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Compared with single detection, the combined detection of tumor markers can significantly improve the value of diagnosis and curative effect monitoring in benign and malignant diseases of the hepatobiliary system. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are rarely used for screening DNA adducts of carcinogens because the harsh conditions required to reverse the formaldehyde-mediated DNA cross-links can destroy DNA adducts. We recently adapted a commercial silica-based column kit used in genomics to manually isolate DNA under mild conditions from FFPE tissues of rodents and humans and successfully measured DNA adducts of several carcinogens including aristolochic acid I (AA-I), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) (Yun et al. (2013) Anal. Chem. 85, 4251-8, and Guo et al. (2016) Anal. Chem. 88, 4780-7). The DNA retrieval methodology is robust; however, the procedure is time-consuming and labor intensive, and not amenable to rapid throughput processing. In this study, we have employed the Promega Maxwell 16 MDx system, which is commonly used in large scale genomics studies, for the rapid throughput extraction of DNA. This system streamlines the DNA isolation procedure and increases the sample processing rate by about 8-fold over the manual method (32 samples versus 4 samples processed per hour). High purity DNA is obtained in satisfactory yield for the measurements of DNA adducts by ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-ionization-ion trap-multistage scan mass spectrometry. The measurements show that the levels of DNA adducts of AA-I, 4-ABP, and PhIP in FFPE rodent and human tissues are comparable to those levels measured in DNA from matching tissues isolated by the commercial silica-based column kits and in DNA from fresh frozen tissues isolated by the conventional phenol-chloroform extraction method. The isolation of DNA from tissues is one major bottleneck in the analysis of DNA adducts. This rapid throughput methodology greatly decreases the time required to process DNA and can be employed in large-scale epidemiology studies designed to assess the role of chemical exposures and DNA adducts in cancer risk. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality. Chemical and virus induction are two major risk factors, however, the potential molecular mechanisms of their differences remain elusive. In this study, to identify the similarities and differences between chemical and virus induced HCC models, we compared the gene expression profiles between DEN and HBx mice models, as well as the differences among tumor, para-tumor and normal tissues. Methods: We sequenced both gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression for HCC tumor tissues, para-tumor and normal liver tissues from DEN model mice (30-week-old) and downloaded the corresponding microarray expression data of HBx model from GEO database. Then differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) were detected by R packages and performed functional enrichment analysis. To explore the gene regulatory network in HCC models, miRNA and TF regulatory networks were constructed by target prediction. Results: For model comparison, although DEGs between tumor and normal tissues in DEN and HBx models only had a small part of overlapping, they shared common pathways including lipid metabolism, oxidation-reduction process and immune process. For tissue comparisons in each model, genes in oxidation-reduction process were down-regulated in tumor tissues and genes in inflammatory response showed the highest expression level in para-tumor tissues. Genes highly expressed in both tumor and para-tumor tissues in two models mainly participated in immune and inflammatory response. Genes expressed in HBx model were also involved in cell proliferation and cell migration etc. Network analysis revealed that several miRNAs such as miR-381-3p, miR-142a-3p, miR-214-3p and TFs such as Egr1, Atf3 and Klf4 were the core regulators in HCC. Conclusions: Through the comparative analyses, we found that para-tumor tissue is a highly inflammatory tissue while the tumor tissue is specific with both inflammatory and cancer signaling pathways. The DEN and HBx mice models have different gene expression pattern but shared pathways. This work will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying different HCC models. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Radiation-associated breast angiosarcoma is a rare clinical entity that is thought to be increasing in incidence. Case Report: Here we present the case of a 67-year-old female with a history of left breast invasive ductal carcinoma who received breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy eight years ago. She then presented with a painless mild skin discoloration of the left breast that had been present for over one year. Mammograms and ultrasounds were normal. A punch biopsy and a subsequent excisional biopsy revealed the diagnosis of angiosarcoma. The patient was treated with mastectomy and had no subsequent recurrences. Conclusions: The long-term clinical surveillance for all patients who receive breast conservation surgery is recommended and a high degree of suspicion should be exercised in view of potential atypical presentations of this disease. © Am J Case Rep, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "DNA methylation is a stable and heritable epigenetic modification in the mammalian genome and is involved in regulating gene expression to control cellular functions. The reversal of DNA methylation, or DNA demethylation, is mediated by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) protein family of dioxygenases. Although it has been widely reported that aberrant DNA methylation and demethylation are associated with developmental defects and cancer, how these epigenetic changes directly contribute to the subsequent alteration in gene expression or disease progression remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of reliable tools to accurately add or remove DNA modifications in the genome at defined temporal and spatial resolution. To overcome this hurdle, we designed a split-TET2 enzyme to enable temporal control of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidation and subsequent remodeling of epigenetic states in mammalian cells by simply adding chemicals. Here, we describe methods for introducing a chemical-inducible epigenome remodeling tool (CiDER), based on an engineered split-TET2 enzyme, into mammalian cells and quantifying the chemical inducible production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) with immunostaining, flow cytometry or a dot-blot assay. This chemical-inducible epigenome remodeling tool will find broad use in interrogating cellular systems without altering the genetic code, as well as in probing the epigenotype−phenotype relations in various biological systems. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",

Questionnaires were applied to 35 illicit drugs users to gather information on demographic status, general health, and use of drugs. Then, a clinical assessment of the oral health condition was performed to collect data on decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index, salivary flow rate (SFR), and mucosal lesions. The control group was composed of 35 non-illicit drug users. In the experimental group, 91.43% were males, 80% were smokers, and 42.85% were alcoholics. Cocaine was the most common drug used (77.15%), followed by marijuana (68.6%), and crack (51.4%). The average DMFT index was 9.8 and the SFR was reduced in 60% of subjects. Mucosal alterations were detected, but no potentially malignant disorders or oral cancer were diagnosed. Compared to control group, significantly higher values for gender (40%, p = 0.0001), smoking (22.86%) and heavy drinking (5.7%) habits (p = 0.0001), SFR (31.4%; p = 0.0308), and oral lesions (p = 0.0488) were found for the experimental group, although significantly higher values were found in the control group for DMFT index (p = 0.0148). It can be concluded that the use of illicit drugs contributed to an increased prevalence of oral mucosa lesions. In addition, a decline on SFR and a reduced DMFT index was observed for illicit drug users.",

    "Abstract": "Bariatric surgery, such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), is a surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that is performed for the purpose of weight loss. Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective long-term treatment for obesity. In addition to weight loss, bariatric surgery produces additional health benefits such as remission of type 2 diabetes, remission of hypertension, and decreased risk of developing certain types of cancer. The mechanisms beyond weight loss for these benefits remain incompletely defined. Therefore, animal models of bariatric surgery are being developed and validated to identify the mechanisms leading to these benefits, with the goal of improving understanding of gastrointestinal physiology and identifying new therapeutic targets. VSG has become the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the clinic in the United States because it is highly effective at producing weight loss and metabolic improvement, and is simpler to perform than other bariatric procedures. Therefore, we have developed and validated a murine model of VSG. This murine VSG model recapitulates many of the effects of VSG seen in humans, including improved glucose and blood pressure regulation. The method is based on isolation of the stomach, ligation of gastric vessels, and removal of 70% of the stomach by transecting along the greater curvature of the stomach. We have successfully applied this surgical protocol to various genetically modified mouse lines to define the mechanistic contributors to the benefits of VSG. Furthermore, this murine VSG model has been combined with other surgical techniques, to achieve deeper mechanistic insight. Therefore, this is a simple and versatile model for studying gastrointestinal physiology and the health benefits of bariatric surgery. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",

    "Abstract": "The present study reports the antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities of Polygonum minus leaf extracts obtained through sequential extraction using four solvents of varying polarities (i.e. hexane (HX), ethyl acetate (EA), methanol, and water). The antioxidant potential was evaluated by measuring the total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical-scavenging, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging, superoxide anion and nitric oxide scavenging, ferrous ion-chelating (FIC), and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assays. The highest antioxidant potential was generally shown by the methanol extract (PM-MeOH). PM-MeOH exhibited the highest values for TPC (174.00 ± 0.18 mg GAE/g), TFC (53.19 ± 0.71 mg GAE/g), FRAP (1728.33 ± 0.96 µmol Fe2+/g), ABTS (226.25 ± 4.25 µmol TE/g), DPPH (1276.81 ± 7.08 µmol TE/g), and nitric oxide scavenging assays (IC50, 675 ± 32.33 µg/mL). In the CAA assay, PM-MeOH dose-dependently inhibited the peroxyl radical-induced oxidation of 2ʹ,7ʹ-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH2) to 2ʹ,7ʹ-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in HCT116 cells, with an EC50 value of 263.92 ± 21.60 µg/mL. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses of PM-MeOH suggested the presence of tannins and flavonoids including apigetrin, hyperoside, isoquercetin, astragalin, miquelianin, quercetin, and quercitrin. P. minus hexane (PM-HX) and ethyl acetate (PM-EA) extracts showed selective cytotoxicity towards HCT116 with IC50 values of 40.00 ± 0.83 µg/mL and 43.18 ± 0.67 µg/mL, respectively. Taken together, these results highlight the potential of P. minus as a source of bioactive phytochemicals that may be useful in cancer therapeutics and nutraceutical industry. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Cachexia and sarcopenia are the main causes of muscle atrophy. These result in a reduction in the muscle fiber area, myo-protein content, and muscle strength, with various molecular modulators being involved. Although several reports have proposed potential therapeutic agents, no effective treatments have been found for muscle atrophy. We searched for myogenic modulators from medicinal plants to treat muscle diseases. We isolated six alkaloids from Corydalis turtschaninovii and evaluated their myogenic potential by using the MyoD reporter gene assay in C2C12 cells. Among the tested compounds, canadine showed the strongest transactivation of MyoD and increased MHC expression during myogenesis. The activation of p38 MAP kinase and Akt are major mechanisms that contribute to the myogenesis by canadine. Canadine increased the number of multinucleated and cylinder-shaped myotubes during myogenesis of C2C12 myoblasts. To determine the preventive effect of canadine in cancer-induced muscle wasting, differentiated C2C12 myotubes were treated with conditioned media from CT26 colon carcinoma culture (CT26 CM) in the presence of canadine. Canadine ameliorated the muscle protein degradation caused by CT26-CM by down-regulating the muscle specific-E3 ligases, MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1. In this study, we found that canadine from C. turtschaninovii stimulates myogenesis and also inhibits muscle protein degradation. Therefore, we suggest canadine as a protective agent against muscle atrophy. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The global phenomenon of population ageing is creating new challenges in both high and middle income countries, as functional limitations are expected to increase with age. The attribution method has been proposed to identify which conditions contribute most to disability using cross-sectional data. Although the original method was based on binary outcomes, we recently proposed an extension to multinomial responses, since different disability levels are often investigated in surveys. This is the first application of the extended method to evaluate differences in the contribution of chronic conditions to functional limitations in the older population of Brazil and Belgium. Methods: Representative data from individuals aged ≥65 years who participated in the 2008 or 2013 Health Interview Surveys in Belgium (N = 4521) or in the 2008 National Household Sample Survey in Brazil (N = 28,437) were analysed. Individuals were classified as without, moderate or severe functional limitations, based on three activities of daily living: eating, showering, and toileting. Six chronic conditions common to the surveys - diabetes, heart diseases, musculoskeletal conditions, depression, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer - were included in the analysis. Separate multinomial additive hazards models by gender for each country were fitted. Results: The prevalence of moderate functional limitations was larger in men in Brazil (8.4%) compared to Belgium (6.0%) and similar in women (approximately 12.0%). Conversely, the severe prevalence in men was similar in the two countries (around 8.0%) and higher in women from Belgium (16.6%) than from Brazil (9.1%). Musculoskeletal conditions were the main contributors to the prevalence of functional limitations in men and women in Belgium but only in men and women with moderate functional limitations in Brazil. Depression and heart diseases contributed most to the severe prevalence of functional limitations in men and women in Brazil, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings provide a better understanding of differences in the prevalence of different levels of functional limitations in Brazil and Belgium. These differences can be related to differences in socioeconomic conditions, health care access and quality, disease diagnosis, stage of epidemiology transition, life expectancy, and the prevalence of lifestyle risk factors in the two countries. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins are frequently overexpressed in various human cancers, therefore have been clinically pursed as attractive therapeutic anti-cancer targets. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism(s) underlying aberrant BET overexpression in human cancers. Recently, we reported that prostate cancer-derived SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote BRD4 degradation, leading to accumulation of BRD4 in prostate cancer cells. As a result, prostate cancer cells harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET inhibitors. Therefore, our results help to elucidate the tumor suppressor role of SPOP in the prostate cancer setting by negatively controlling BET proteins stability. More importantly, our results also provide a molecular basis for using combination with BET inhibitors and other inhibitors to treat prostate cancer patients with SPOP mutations. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been reported to exert its anti-cancer activities in human cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of ATO-triggered anti-tumor activity has not been fully elucidated. Recently, multiple studies demonstrated that ATO could regulate miRNAs in human cancers. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether ATO regulated let-7a in breast cancer cells. We found that ATO upregulated let-7a level in breast cancer cells. We also found that up-regulation of let-7a inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis and retarded cell migration and invasion. We also observed that up-regulation of let-7a enhanced cell growth inhibition and invasion suppression induced by ATO treatment. Our findings suggest that ATO suppressed cell growth, stimulated apoptosis, and retarded cell invasion partly via upregulation of let-7a in breast cancer cells. Our study provides a new anti-tumor mechanism of ATO treatment in breast cancer. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Profilin-1 (Pfn1) is an important actin-regulatory protein that is downregulated in human breast cancer and when forcibly elevated, it suppresses the tumor-initiating ability of triple-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that Pfn1 overexpression reduces the stem-like phenotype (a key biologic feature associated with higher tumor-initiating potential) of MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) triple-negative breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the stem-like trait of MDA-231 cells is also attenuated upon depletion of Pfn1. A comparison of cancer stem cell gene (CSC) gene expression signatures between depleted and elevated conditions of Pfn1 further suggest that Pfn1 may be somehow involved in regulating the expression of a few CSC-related genes including MUC1, STAT3, FZD7, and ITGB1. Consistent with the reduced stem-like phenotype associated with loss-of-function of Pfn1, xenograft studies showed lower tumor-initiating frequency of Pfn1-depleted MDA-231 cells compared to their control counterparts. In MMTV:PyMT mouse model, homozygous but not heterozygous deletion of Pfn1 gene leads to severe genetic mosaicism and positive selection of Pfn1-proficient tumor cells further supporting the contention that a complete lack of Pfn1 is likely not conducive for efficient tumor initiation capability of breast cancer cells. In summary, these findings suggest that the maintenance of optimal stemness and tumor-initiating ability of breast cancer cells requires a balanced expression of Pfn1. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can provoke a series of negative emotional changes in patients, further affecting their quality of life. It has been shown that patients with higher resilience have better quality of life. Social support systems are important protective factors that are necessary for the process of resilience to occur. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the role of social support in the relationship between resilience and quality of life among Chinese patients with breast cancer. Material/Methods: A demographic-disease survey, the Chinese version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 25, Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast Cancer Version 3 were used to interview 98 patients with breast cancer from a teaching hospital in Chongqing, China. Data analysis was performed by descriptive statistics, independent-sample t test, one-way ANOVA, and regression analyses. Results: The mean scores of resilience, social support, and quality of life were 54.68, 61.73, and 80.74 respectively, which were in the moderate range. Participants with stronger social support had higher resilience and better quality of life. Social support played a partial mediator role in the relationship between resilience and quality of life. The mediation effect ratio was 28.0%. Conclusions: Social support is essential for the development of resilience and the improvement of quality of life in Chinese patients with breast cancer. Health professionals should provide appropriate guidelines to help patients seek effective support and enhance their resilience to improve their quality of life after breast cancer. © Med Sci Monit, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Several Euphorbia species have been used in folklore as cancer remedies, however, scientific studies on the cytotoxicity (in vitro studies) of Euphorbia caducifolia are lacking. In present study, anticancer potential of E. caducifolia aerial parts ethanol extract and its fractions were evaluated against human lung (NCI-H460), breast (MCF-7), prostate (PC-3) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines, using sulphorhodamine-B in vitro cytotoxicity (in vitro studies) assay. The ethanol extract demonstrated growth inhibitory effect against all aforementioned cancer cell lines with IC 50 , 19–135 μg/mL and LC 50 , ~220 μg/mL, and its petroleum ether fraction obtained on bioactivity guided fraction showed highest activity with IC 50 , 28–70 μg/mL and LC 50 , 71 μg/mL against NCI-H460 and MCF-7 cell lines. Its phytochemicals were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The present study provides scientific justification for its traditional use against cancer. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Lung carcinoma tops the categories of cancer related motility, and has been treated as the main threat to human health. The functions and related mechanism of FBXW7 controlled lung cancer stem cells' signatures is barely unknown, and the miR-367 regulations of FBXW7 via Wnt signaling have not been explored. Cancer stem cells of either ALDH1+ or CD133+ phenotype were found to be referred to advanced stages in patients with NSCLC (non-small cell lung carcinoma). To study the roles of miR-367, we found greater miR-367 level or FBXW7 level was reserved in NSCLC than that of paired adjacent normal tissues, and their upregulations were positively correlated with Wnt signaling activation. On the contrary, increased miR-367 was correlated with Let-7 repression. MiR-367 was related to stronger sphere forming ability in stem cells of NSCLC. We then explored the functions of the endogenous miR-367 in stem-like cells isolated from NSCLC cell lines. In HEK-293 cells, we identified FBXW7 as the direct downstream gene of miR-367, which consequently released the LIN-28 dependent inhibition of suppressive Let-7. Through informatics analysis, miR-367 was predicated to function through Wnt signaling, and decreased Let-7 played the pivotal role to maintain TCF-4/Wnt pathway activity. The reintroduction of FBXW7 abolished the oncogenic stimulation of miR-367 on TCF-4 activity, with Wnt signaling factors depression. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated the oncogenic roles of miR-367 exerting on the self-renewal ability of cancer stem-like cells through degrading the suppressive FBXW7, eventually helping to maintain Wnt signaling activation through a LIN28B/Let-7 dependent manner. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "We have developed an efficient and straightforward methodology for the synthesis of novel tanshinone-substituted bis(indolyl/pyrrolyl)methane scaffolds 3 through TsOH catalysis-enabled addition of indoles or pyrroles 1 with tanshinones 2 based on molecular hybridization strategy. Products were smoothly obtained in good yields (up to 81% yield). This protocol also represents the first construction of tanshinone skeleton-fused bis(indolyl/pyrrolyl)methane scaffolds, thus leading to new knowledge in the fields of both molecular complexity and diversity-oriented synthesis and the lead compound discovery. Furthermore, their biological activities against human leukemia cells K562, human prostate cancer cells PC-3, and human lung cancer cells A549 have been preliminarily demonstrated by in vitro assays. The results demonstrated that most of these compounds 3 obtained by this protocol showed comparable activity to the positive control of cisplatin. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Malignant ovarian germ cell tumor is a rare type of disease, which generally has a good prognosis due to the high chemosensitivity of this type of tumor. Fertility preservation is an important issue because malignant ovarian germ cell tumor commonly affects young women. Although conservation is the standard for early stage, it becomes more debatable as the disease progresses to more advanced stages. Aim: Report the case of a patient with an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IIIc malignant ovarian germ cell tumor, who had conservative surgery and chemotherapy with a good fertility outcome. Case presentation: A 23-year-old North African woman with a left malignant ovarian germ cell tumor stage IIIc was treated by left adnexectomy and omentectomy followed by chemotherapy. A 15-year follow-up showed no signs of relapse, and she completed three full-term natural pregnancies. Conclusions: Malignant ovarian germ cell tumor is a rare ovarian tumor with a good prognosis. It is usually associated with a good fertility outcome in early stages. However, due to the rarity of the disease in advanced stages, the fertility outcome for this group of patients is not clear. This lack of data surrounding advanced stages points to the need for a meta-analysis of all published cases. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "DNA damage activated by Adriamycin (ADR) promotes ubiquitin–proteasome system-mediated proteolysis by stimulating both the activity of ubiquitylating enzymes and the proteasome. In ADR-resistant breast cancer MCF7 (MCF7ADR) cells, protein ubiquitylation is significantly reduced compared to the parental MCF7 cells. Here, we used tandem ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs) to analyze the ubiquitylation pattern observed in MCF7 or MCF7ADR cells. While in MCF7, the level of total ubiquitylation increased up to six-fold in response to ADR, in MCF7ADR cells only a two-fold response was found. To further explore these differences, we looked for cellular factors presenting ubiquitylation defects in MCF7ADR cells. Among them, we found the tumor suppressor p53 and its ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. We also observed a drastic decrease of proteins known to integrate the TUBE-associated ubiquitin proteome after ADR treatment of MCF7 cells, like histone H2AX, HMGB1 or β-tubulin. Only the proteasome inhibitor MG132, but not the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine partially recovers the levels of total protein ubiquitylation in MCF7ADR cells. p53 ubiquitylation is markedly increased in MCF7ADR cells after proteasome inhibition or a short treatment with the isopeptidase inhibitor PR619, suggesting an active role of these enzymes in the regulation of this tumor suppressor. Notably, MG132 alone increases apoptosis of MCF7ADR and multidrug resistant ovarian cancer A2780DR1 and A2780DR2 cells. Altogether, our results highlight the use of ubiquitylation defects to predict resistance to ADR and underline the potential of proteasome inhibitors to treat these chemoresistant cells. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Chromosome instability (CIN) contributes to the development of many cancer. In this paper, we summarize our recent finding that a novel pathway by which FBW7 loss promotes Centromere Protein A (CENP-A) phosphorylation on Serine 18 through Cyclin E1/CDK2, therefore promoting CIN and tumorigenesis. Our finding demonstrates the importance of CENP-A post-translational modification on modulating centromere and mitotic functions in cancer. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Cyclin D1 and cyclin E1, as vital regulatory factors of G1-S phase cell cycle progression, are frequently constitutive expressed and associated with pathogenesis and tumorigenesis in most human cancers and they have been regarded as promising targets for cancer therapy. In this study, we established NVP-BEZ235, a potent dual kinase inhibitor, could induce neuroblastoma cells proliferation inhibition without apoptosis activation. Moreover, we showed NVP-BEZ235 could induce neuroblastoma cells arrested at G0/G1 phase accompanied with significant reduction of the cyclin D1 and E1 proteins in a dose dependent manner at nanomole concentration. Additionally we found that GSK3β was dephosphorylated and activated by NVP-BEZ235 and then triggered cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 degradation through ubiquitination proteasome pathway, based on the evidences that NVP-BEZ235 induced downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 were obviously recovered by proteasome inhibitor and the blockade of GSK3β contributed to remarkable rescue of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1. Analogous results about its anti-proliferation effects and molecular mechanism were observed on neuroblastoma xenograft mouse model in vivo. Therefore, these results indicate that NVP-BEZ235-induced cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 degradation, which happened through activating GSK3β, and GSK3β-dependent down-regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 should be available for anticancer therapeutics. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Glioma remains one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers in central nervous system. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in gliomas. However, therapeutic benefits of TMZ could be very limited and all patients would finally suffer from tumor progression as the tumors develop resistance to TMZ. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying mechanism of chemoresistance in glioma cell line and to identify whether there is still a close link between epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and TMZ resistance in gliomas. The real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure the expression of EMT markers in TMZ-resistant cells. The migration and invasion assays were conducted to detect the cell motility activity in TMZ-resistant cells. The transfection was used to down-regulate the Cdc20 expression. The student t-test was applied for data analysis. We established stable TMZ-resistant glioma cells and designated as TR. Our results revealed that TR cells exhibited a significantly increased resistance to TMZ compared with their parental cells. Moreover, TMZ-resistant cells had acquired EMT-like changes. For the mechanism study, we measured a significant increased expression of CDC20 and decreased expression of Bim in TR cells. Moreover, upon suppression of CDC20 by shRNA transfection, TR cells underwent a reverse of EMT features. Importantly, knockdown of CDC20 enhanced the drug sensitivity of TR cells to TMZ. Our results suggested that inactivation of CDC20 could contribute to the future therapy that possibly overcomes drug resistance in human cancers. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "The mycotoxin citrinin (CTN) is a natural contaminant of various human foods that may produce serious adverse health problems. Several studies demonstrated that citrinin exerts cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in both in vivo and in vitro systems. However, the precise mechanisms of action (MOA), particularly in intestinal cells remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the precise MOA of citrinin in vitro. Data demonstrated that CTN significantly decreased the number of viable human intestinal HCT116 cells and induced apoptotic events including (1) decrease in ΔѰm indicative of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, (2) activation of caspase 3, (3) elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (4) relative persistence of plasma membrane integrity. Further, the genetic deficiency of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax protected cells against CTN-induced apoptosis, indicating that Bax is required for CTN-mediated toxicity. It was also found that CTN triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated different arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR) as demonstrated by increase in expression of GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein-78), GRP94 (glucose-regulated protein-94), GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein-34), the protein disulfide isomerase associated 6 (PDIA6), CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein) and the splicing of XBP1 (X-Box Binding Protein 1). Pretreatment of cells with the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), known to alleviate ER stress, prevented significantly the apoptotic process triggered by CTN. Taken together, these results suggest that CTN exerts its cytotoxic effects in HCT116 cells by inducing apoptosis, at least in part, through induction of ER stress. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced alopecia affects the pathological as well as the psychological aspects of the cancer patient. In the present study, the protective role of Nigella sativa was evaluated in both adult and newborn albino rats. The anagen phase was first induced. N. sativa oil, N. sativa decoction (5%, 10% and 15%) and minoxidil lotion (standard) were applied daily to the rats two days after the depilation. During the anagen VI phase of the hair follicles, alopecia was induced by giving cyclophosphamide 125 mg/kg, ip to the adult rat and 50 mg/kg to the newborn rats. Cyclophosphamide-induced the alopecia to the whole depilated area of skin in adult rat while alopecia totalis was observed in the newborn rat disease control group. N. sativa oil, N. sativa decoction (5%) showed a significant protective effect against cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia. In conclusion, it is evident that N. sativa provides significant protection against chemotherapy-induced alopecia. © 2017, Bangladesh Pharmacological Society. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Exposure to crystalline silica results in serious adverse health effects, most notably, silicosis. An understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying silica-induced pulmonary toxicity is critical for the intervention and/or prevention of its adverse health effects. Rats were exposed by inhalation to crystalline silica at a concentration of 15 mg/m3, 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 3, 6 or 12 weeks. Pulmonary toxicity and global gene expression profiles were determined in lungs at the end of each exposure period. Crystalline silica was visible in lungs of rats especially in the 12-week group. Pulmonary toxicity, as evidenced by an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and albumin content and accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), was seen in animals depending upon silica exposure duration. The most severe histological changes, noted in the 12-week exposure group, consisted of chronic active inflammation, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibrosis. Microarray analysis of lung gene expression profiles detected significant differential expression of 38, 77, and 99 genes in rats exposed to silica for 3-, 6-, or 12-weeks, respectively, compared to time-matched controls. Among the significantly differentially expressed genes (SDEG), 32 genes were common in all exposure groups. Bioinformatics analysis of the SDEG identified enrichment of functions, networks and canonical pathways related to inflammation, cancer, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and tissue remodeling in response to silica exposure.

    "Abstract": "It is well known that cigarette smoking (CS) and/or radon (Rn) induce malignant transformation in lung cells. To investigate the mechanisms underlying lung carcinogenesis induced by CS, Rn; or Rn followed by CS using BEAS-2B cell line derived from human bronchial epithelial cells. BEAS-2B cells were exposed to either Rn (20,000 Bq/m3) for 30 min or CS (20%) for 10 min or Rn followed by CS for 40 min. Global and gene-specific DNA methylation modifications were measured by microarray and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry, while soft agar colony formation was conducted to assess the characteristics of malignant transformation. Data demonstrated global hypomethylation as well as gene-specific DNA methylation alterations in all treatment groups compared to unexposed control cells. In addition, Rn and CS produced DNA hypermethylation of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type M and ectodysplasin A2 receptor, two genes related to malignant transformation. In all treatment conditions, cell proliferation and survival of malignant cells was increased, while apoptosis was initially first passage elevated but decreased at passages 5–15. Our results indicate that aberrant DNA methylation plays an important role in Rn- and/or CS-induced malignant transformation. In addition, BEAS-2B cell line may be used as an in vitro model to investigate mechanisms underlying malignant transformation induced by ambient environmental contaminants. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Statins are the backbone of lipid-lowering therapy and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in the elderly population in Sweden today. Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women, after prostate and breast cancer, respectively, with a median age of 72years at diagnosis. Statins induce mitochondrial damage leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the cell. Reactive oxygen species can cause mutations in mitochondrial as well as nuclear DNA leading to the development of cancer. Our hypothesis was that statins increase the risk for colorectal cancer. Methods: A case study was performed on consecutive cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed at Norrlands University Hospital (NUS) in Umeå between 2012 and 2015 (n=325). Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II (DM II n=65) were excluded in the primary endpoint analysis (occurrence of colorectal cancer). As control, three databases were used to create an age-matched population in order to calculate the proportion of inhabitants using statins in the county of Västerbotten, Sweden. A secondary endpoint was cancer-specific survival among our study group of colorectal cancer patients, including those with DM II, investigating whether there was a difference if the patient was a 'recent' statin user or not at the time of diagnosis. Results: Statin use at the time of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the study group was 23.8%. The corresponding figure in an age-matched population in Västerbotten was 24.6%. Using a one-proportional one-sided z test, there was no significant difference between these (23.8%, 95% CI 18.6-29.0%, p=0.601). When comparing groups 20-64years of age, the difference was greater with recent statin use in 17.8% in the study population and 11.9% in Västerbotten (17.8%, 95% CI 9.0-26.6%, p=0.059). When considering cancer-specific survival, no significant difference in survival was seen when comparing 'former/never' statin users as reference category with 'recent' users diagnosed with colorectal cancer (HR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89-2.16). Conclusions: No significant increase in risk for developing colorectal cancer among patients (type II diabetics excluded) medicated with statins was found. We found no correlation between 'recent' statin use at the time of diagnosis and cancer-specific survival. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to quantitate 42 serum-free amino acids, propose the biochemical explanation of their role in tumor development, and identify new ovarian cancer (OC) biomarkers for potential use in OC screening. The additional value of this work is the schematic presentation of the interrelationship between metabolites which were identified as significant for OC development and progression. The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique using highly-selective multiple reaction monitoring mode and labeled internal standards for each analyzed compound was applied. Performed statistical analyses showed that amino acids are potentially useful as OC biomarkers, especially as variables in multi-marker models. For the distinguishing metabolites the following metabolic pathways involved in cancer growth and development were proposed: histidine metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; arginine biosynthesis; arginine and proline metabolism; and alanine, aspartate and glutamine metabolism. The presented research identifies histidine and citrulline as potential new OC biomarkers. Furthermore, it provides evidence that amino acids are involved in metabolic pathways related to tumor growth and play an important role in cancerogenesis. © 2017 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "C-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-binding protein (Cbp) is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane adaptor protein which regulating Src family kinase (SFK) activities. Although SFKs are well known for their involvement in breast cancer, the function of Cbp in breast carcinogenesis upon the adipose-tumor microenvironment has not been investigated. Here, we reported that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) induced increased expression of Cbp accompanied by enhanced cell proliferation and chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer cell MCF-7/ADR. Depletion of Cbp in breast cancer cell by RNA interference led to remarkable inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion as well as synergy with adriamycin hydrochloride to suppress the tumor growth. Furthermore, silencing of Cbp concomitantly inhibited the expression of phosphoryl of Src, AKT and mTOR signals. Our study highlights the underlying mechanism of cross interaction between ASCs and breast cancer cells, and indicates that PAG1/Cbp in breast cancer cell may modulate tumor progression and acquired chemoresistance in the ASCs-associated breast cancer microenvironment through Src and AKT/mTOR pathways. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane receptor for coagulation factor VII/VIIa and is frequently overexpressed by cancer cells. The TF/VIIa complex acts as the main initiator of the clotting cascade in blood and a trigger of intracellular signaling that changes gene expression and the cellular phenotype. However, pathways mediating these changes are still poorly characterized and especially the impact of TF signals on regulatory microRNA (miR) networks in cancer remains unknown. We show that the monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralises the signaling (but not coagulant) function of human TF (CNTO 2559) inhibits progression of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts in mice and prolongs animal survival. CNTO 2559 blocks FVIIa-induced expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) by cancer cells without impacting factor Xa (FXa) generation. Notably, acute exposure of MDA-MB-231 tumour xenografts to CNTO 2559 systemic injections triggers wide spread changes in the tumour miR profile including alterations in 75 miRs (55 downregulated) and impacting several miR-regulated and cancer-related pathways. These results suggest that TF signaling in the tumour microenvironment may provoke vast changes in the miR profile of cancer cells, affect disease biology, and reflect tumour interaction with the coagulation system, thereby presenting itself as a possible biomarker. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Ovarian cancer is usually diagnosed at a late stage when outcomes are poor. Personalised ovarian cancer risk prediction, based on genetic and epidemiological information and risk stratified management in adult women could improve outcomes. Examining health care professionals' (HCP) attitudes to ovarian cancer risk stratified management, willingness to support women, self-efficacy (belief in one's own ability to successfully complete a task), and knowledge about ovarian cancer will help identify training needs in anticipation of personalised ovarian cancer risk prediction being introduced. Methods: An anonymous survey was distributed online to HCPs via relevant professional organisations in the UK. Kruskal-Wallis tests and pairwise comparisons were used to compare knowledge and self-efficacy scores between different types of HCPs, and attitudes toward population-based genetic testing and risk stratified management were described. Content analysis was undertaken of free text responses concerning HCPs willingness to discuss risk management options with women. Results: One hundred forty-six eligible HCPs completed the survey: oncologists (31%); genetics clinicians (30%); general practitioners (22%); gynaecologists (10%); nurses (4%); and 'others'. Scores for knowledge of ovarian cancer and genetics, and self-efficacy in conducting a cancer risk consultation were generally high but significantly lower for general practitioners compared to genetics clinicians, oncologists, and gynaecologists. Support for population-based genetic testing was not high (<50%). Attitudes towards ovarian cancer risk stratification were mixed, although the majority of participants indicated a willingness to discuss management options with patients. Conclusions: Larger samples are required to investigate attitudes to population-based genetic testing for ovarian cancer risk and to establish why some HCPs are hesitant to offer testing to all adult female patients. If ovarian cancer risk assessment using genetic testing and non-genetic information including epidemiological information is rolled out on a population basis, training will be needed for HCPs in primary care to enable them to provide appropriate support to women at each stage of the process. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Funding Text 1": "An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was developed using the software Opinio as an effective method of reaching a convenience sample of HCPs [31]. This type of non-probability sampling involves drawing the sample from a readily available and convenient source of HCPs via groups and networks to which we had easy access. These included: British Gynaecological Cancer Society, National Forum of Gynaecological Oncology Nurses; the UK Cancer Genetics Group; Cancer, General Practice and Genetics Clinical Research Networks, The Royal College of General Practitioners; and the National Cancer Research Institute. We also recruited participants by ‘snowballing’ using a list of researcher contacts. Potential participants received an invitation from their professional organisation either by email with a link to the online survey, or by a similarly worded advertisement in a web-based professional news update. Some organisations sent a reminder email or advertisement with a link to the survey approximately 1 month after the initial invitation. Participants were eligible if they self-identified as a HCP based in the UK and the survey had relevance to their practice. HCPs who voluntarily accessed the survey, and completed and submitted it, did so in the knowledge that they were thereby giving consent for their anonymous responses to be included in the study. The participant information preface to the online survey explained these steps in the consent process and stated that since data was anonymous formal verbal or written consent was not required. The study was approved by UCL research ethics committee (project ID: 8053/002) and was open to participants for 3 months from March 2016.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In a previous paper, we had assumed that the risk of screen-detected breast cancer mostly reflects inherent risk, and the risk of whether a breast cancer is interval versus screen-detected mostly reflects risk of masking. We found that inherent risk was predicted by body mass index (BMI) and dense area (DA) or percent dense area (PDA), but not by non-dense area (NDA). Masking, however, was best predicted by PDA but not BMI. In this study, we aimed to investigate if these associations vary by tumor characteristics and mode of detection. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study of 244 screen-detected cases matched to 700 controls and 148 interval cases matched to 446 controls. DA, NDA and PDA were measured using the Cumulus software. Tumor characteristics included size, grade, lymph node involvement, and ER, PR, and HER2 status. Conditional and unconditional logistic regression were applied as appropriate to estimate the Odds per Adjusted Standard Deviation (OPERA) adjusted for age and BMI, allowing the association with BMI to be a function of age at diagnosis. Results: For screen-detected cancer, both DA and PDA were associated to an increased risk of tumors of large size (OPERA ~ 1.6) and positive lymph node involvement (OPERA ~ 1.8); no association was observed for BMI and NDA. For risk of interval versus screen-detected breast cancer, the association with risk for any of the three mammographic measures did not vary by tumor characteristics; an association was observed for BMI for positive lymph nodes (OPERA ~ 0.6). No associations were observed for tumor grade and ER, PR and HER2 status of tumor. Conclusions: Both DA and PDA were predictors of inherent risk of larger breast tumors and positive nodal status, whereas for each of the three mammographic density measures the association with risk of masking did not vary by tumor characteristics. This might raise the hypothesis that the risk of breast tumours with poorer prognosis, such as larger and node positive tumours, is intrinsically associated with increased mammographic density and not through delay of diagnosis due to masking. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The significance of PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1) has become increasingly essential as both a biomarker and a target for cancer treatment. Here, we aimed to determine the downstream genes of PLK1 and their effects on the carcinogenesis and progression of bladder cancer. Methods: Specific siRNA was utilized to silence the target gene expression. The cell proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells by MTT assay, BrdU assay and transwell assay. The differential expression genes were identified using Affymetrix HTA2.0 Array. The KEGG, GO and STRING analysis were used to analyze the signaling pathway and protein-protein interaction. Spearman analysis was used to analyze the correlation between protein and protein, between protein and clincopathologic characteristics. Results: PLK1 siRNA hindered the proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells, as determined by the MTT, BrdU and transwell assays. A total of 561 differentially expressed genes were identified using an Affymetrix HTA2.0 Array in PLK1 knockdown T24 cells. According to KEGG, GO and STRING analysis, five key genes (BUB1B, CCNB1, CDC25A, FBXO5, NDC80) were determined to be involved in cell proliferation, invasion and migration. PLK1 knockdown decreased BUB1B, CCNB1, CDC25A and NDC80 expressions but increased FBXO5 expression. BUB1B, CCNB1, CDC25A and NDC80 were positively correlated with cell proliferation, invasion, migration and PLK1 expression in tissues, but FBXO5 was negatively correlated with each of those factors. The results showed that the five genes expressions were significantly correlation with the PLK1 expression in normal bladder tissues and bladder cancer tissues. Four of them (BUB1B, CCNB1, CDC25A, NDC80) were obviously positive correlations with pT stage and metastasis. But FBXO5 was negative correlated with pT stage and metastasis. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between CCNB1 or CDC25A or NDC80 and histological grade; between BUB1B or NDC80 and recurrence. Conclusion: Five downstream genes of PLK1 were associated with the regulation of cell proliferation, invasion and migration in bladder cancer. Furthermore, these genes may play important roles in bladder cancer and become important biomarkers and targets for cancer treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer is now viewed as a chronic disease, presenting challenges to follow-up and survivorship care. Models to shift from haphazard, suboptimal and fragmented episodes of care to an integrated cancer care continuum must be developed, tested and implemented. Numerous studies demonstrate improved care when follow-up is assured by both oncology and primary care providers rather than either group alone. However, there is little data on the roles assumed by specialized oncology teams and primary care providers and the extent to which they work together. This study aims to develop, pilot test and measure outcomes of an innovative risk-based coordinated cancer care model for patients transitioning from specialized oncology teams to primary care providers. Methods/design: This multiple case study using a sequential mixed-methods design rests on a theory-driven realist evaluation approach to understand how transitions might be improved. The cases are two health regions in Quebec, Canada, defined by their geographic territory. Each case includes a Cancer Centre and three Family Medicine Groups selected based on differences in their determining characteristics. Qualitative data will be collected from document review (scientific journal, grey literature, local documentation), semi-directed interviews with key informants, and observation of care coordination practices. Qualitative data will be supplemented with a survey to measure the outcome of the coordinated model among providers (scope of practice, collaboration, relational coordination, leadership) and patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer (access to care, patient-centredness, communication, self-care, survivorship profile, quality of life). Results from descriptive and regression analyses will be triangulated with thematic analysis of qualitative data. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods data will be interpreted within and across cases in order to identify context-mechanism associations that explain outcomes. Discussion: The study will provide empirical data on a risk-based coordinated model of cancer care to guide actions at different levels in the health system. This in-depth multiple case study using a realist approach considers both the need for context-specific intervention research and the imperative to address research gaps regarding coordinated models of cancer care. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Smad3 linker phosphorylation is a candidate target for several kinases that play important roles in cancer cell initiation, proliferation and progression. Also, Smad3 is an essential intracellular mediator of TGF-β1-induced transcriptional responses during carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is highly advantageous to identify and develop inhibitors targeting Smad3 linker phosphorylation for the treatment of cancers. Galangin (3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) has been known to be an active flavonoid showing a cytotoxic effect on several cancer cells. However, the mechanism of action of galangin in various cancers remains unclear, and there has been no report concerning regulation of Smad3 phosphorylation by galangin. In the present study, we show that galangin significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in the presence of TGF-β1 in both human prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Particularly, galangin effectively inhibits phosphorylation of the Thr-179 site at Smad3 linker region through suppression of CDK4 phosphorylation. Thus, galangin can be a promising candidate as a selective inhibitor to suppress phosphorylation of Smad3 linker region. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives To identify antigenic peptides of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) antigen, DNAJB8, and establish a mouse CSCs-targeting immunotherapy model. Materials and methods To induce DNAJB8-specific immune reaction, we stimulated human CD8+ lymphocytes with antigen-presenting cells pulsed with a cocktail of three candidate HLA-A*24:02 restricted peptides and assessed peptide specific human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induction. One of the antigenic peptides showed identical amino acid sequence as corresponding mouse DNAJB8. We evaluated CTL induction with the peptide immunization in mouse model. Results We confirmed peptide-specific interferon-γ secretions and cytotoxic activities of induced human CTLs. In vivo immunization with the peptide to mice, peptide-specific CTL response could be observed in mouse CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, immunization with the peptide showed significant anti-tumor effects compared with negative controls. Conclusion DNAJB8-derived peptide is a novel candidate for CSCs-targeting immunotherapy, and mouse models can be used to evaluate CSCs-targeting immunotherapy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is a viral protein expressed in all EBV-infected cells that induces malignant transformation. EBNA1 is reported to contribute to tumor progression through an increase in reactive oxygen species via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of EBNA1-induced ROS accumulation in gastric cancer is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that miR34a regulation by EBNA1 determined cell fate in EBV-infected gastric cancer cells. ROS content and NOX2 expression were higher in EBNA1-expressing SNU719 cells than in EBNA1-nonexpressing SNU638 cells. Downregulation of NOX2 using siRNA technology in SNU719 cells decreased cell viability and ROS content. Regulation of EBNA1 expression in EBV-associated gastric cancers modulated NOX2 expression, ROS content and cell viability. We also showed that upregulation of NOX2 by EBNA1 was mediated by downregulating miRNA34a. Finally, overexpression of miR34a in EBNA1-expressing SNU719 cells induced typical apoptosis, suggesting that reactivation of miR34a in EBNA1-expressing gastric cancer cells could be a strategy for treatment of EBV-infected gastric cancer cells. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Physician recommendations for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening have consistently been shown to be a strong predictor of screening. The aim of this study was to investigate perceptions of CRC screening modalities and recommendation behaviors among physicians in Korea. Methods: A cross-sectional, nationally representative survey conducted between November 2013 and February 2014. In total, 379 physicians (241 primary care physicians and 138 physicians affiliated with the Korean Association for the Study of Intestinal Diseases responded to this survey (overall response rate of 31.4%). Results: About 29% of all respondents \"always\" recommended and about 67% \"sometimes\" recommended CRC screening. Colonoscopy was perceived as an effective primary screening tool for CRC, and 80% of the physicians recommended colonoscopy for CRC screening. Only 7% recommended FOBT. In multivariate analysis, recommending FOBT was associated with stronger belief in the screening efficacy of FOBT (aOR 3.70, 95% CI 2.09, 6.57), weaker belief in the screening efficacy of colonoscopy (aOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12, 0.69), and negative decisional balance for colonoscopy screening (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71, 0.95). Conclusions: Although FOBT is provided free-of-charge through a nationwide CRC screening program, colonoscopy was more commonly recommended and preferred by physicians. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Various plant extracts have been suggested to be used as auxiliary agents in chemotherapy considering their anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells. However, recent reports reveal that plant extracts may function as inducers of autophagy of cancer cells. In general, autophagy confers survival advantage for cells responding to stress conditions, thus representing an important mechanism for chemo-resistance. This study was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of combined use of Salidroside (Sal, a phenylpropanoid glycosides from Rhodiola rosea L) with anti-tumor agents against colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, and moreover to evaluate the potential role of autophagy in the combined therapy. Methods: CRC cells, HCT-116, were incubated with Sal alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents including oxaliplatin (OXA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Doxorubicin (ADM). Cell proliferative characteristics were evaluated by cell viability and apoptosis rate. The protein expression was assessed by Immunofluorescent and Western blot assays. Results: Sal, alone or in combination with anti-tumor agents, increased expression of autophagic biomarkers, including LC3B and Becline-1, suggesting an autophagy induction. Except for the up-regulation of p-AMPK, p-mTOR, p-NF-ΚB (p65), TGF-β, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were down-regulated by Sal. Because autophagy is positively correlated with the activation of AMPK/mTOR, NF-ΚB, TGFβ1 and JAK2/STAT3 cascades, the autophagy induced by Sal may associate with AMPK activation. Indeed, blockage of AMPK signaling via Compound C or AMPK knockdown inhibited the autophagy. The blockage of AMPK signaling or a direct inhibition of autophagy via 3-MA increased effectiveness of combined use of Sal with anti-tumor agents against CRC. Conclusions: Inhibition of autophagy enhances synergistic effects of Sal and anti-tumor agents against colorectal cancer. This study provides experimental evidence and theoretical reference for improvement of a novel chemotherapy treatment protocol. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Deleted in Breast Cancer 1 (DBC1) is a regulatory protein involved in cell metabolism and cancer progression. Nevertheless, the expression and prognostic values of DBC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still not well understood. The following study investigated the clinical significance and biological function of DBC1 in HCC. Briefly, overexpression of DBC1 at transcriptional and translational levels in human HCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues was observed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach. Furthermore, upregulated DBC1 was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = 0.005), N stage (p = 0.016), M stage (p = 0.011), tumor differentiation (p < 0.001), and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (p = 0.001). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that DBC1 was an independent prognosis predictor for disease-free survival (DFS) (p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001). In addition, by using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays and colony formation assays, we found that the knockdown of DBC1 significantly suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro. To conclude, these findings demonstrated that DBC1 was essential in tumorigenesis and proliferation. Moreover, it was identified as a potential therapeutic target for HCC. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Autophagy is a cell survival process that represents a therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Many types of cytochalasins have been identified and some of them have been reported to interfere with the formation of the autophagosome, although only limited data are available to assess their potential effects. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects of cytochalasins and structurally related compounds on cell survival and the regulation of autophagy in human lung A549 adenocarcinoma cells. Cytochalasin D (CD) and cytochalasin E (CE) prominently inhibited the growth of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Following treatment with CE, F-actin filaments were disrupted, and the proportion of binucleated cells increased, whereas no such effects were observed with the seven other cytochalasins tested. We found that cytochalasin H (CH), CD, and especially CE could induce the up-regulation of autophagy-related protein (LC3-II) and SQSTM1/p62. Using bafilomycin A1, we demonstrated that CD, CE, and CH inhibited autophagosome turnover, resulting in a dysfunctional autophagic process. The results of this study reveal that CE is the most potent cytochalasin in terms of its ability to induce cell death and inhibit autophagy. CE may therefore be an effective therapeutic agent against lung cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the cancer types with poor prognosis. To effectively treat HCC, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate (IMP) cyclohydrolase (ATIC), a bifunctional protein enzyme, catalyzes the last two steps of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. Whether ATIC contributes to cancer development remains unclear. Methods: ATIC mRNA levels in different types of human HCC samples or normal tissues were determined from Gene Expression across Normal and Tumor tissue (GENT) database. The expression level of ATIC in human HCC samples or cell lines were examined by RT-PCR and western blot. Overall survival and disease-free survival of HCC patients in the ATIC low and ATIC high groups were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Effects of ATIC knockdown by lentivirus infection were evaluated on cell-proliferation, cell-apoptosis, colony formation and migration. The mechanisms involved in HCC cells growth, apoptosis and migration were analyzed by western blot and Compound C (C-C) rescue assays. Results: Here, we first demonstrated that expression of ATIC is aberrantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and high level of ATIC is correlated with poor survival in HCC patients. Knockdown of ATIC expression resulted in a dramatic decrease in proliferation, colony formation and migration of HCC cells. We also identified ATIC as a novel regulator of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream signaling mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). ATIC suppresses AMPK activation, thus activates mTOR-S6 K1-S6 signaling and supports growth and motility activity of HCC cells. Conclusion: Taken together, our results indicate that ATIC acts as an oncogenic gene that promotes survival, proliferation and migration by targeting AMPK-mTOR-S6 K1 signaling. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although the majority of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura (SFTP) follow a benign course, 10-25% of patients suffer from recurrence or metastatic disease. Several scoring models have been proposed to predict the outcome. However, none of these included immunohistochemical (IHC) markers as possible prognosticators. Methods: In this multicenter study, we collected clinical data and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks of patients with histologically proven SFTP which had been surgically resected between 2000 und 2015. After systematic and extensive IHC staining on tissue microarrays, the results were analyzed and compared to histomorphological and clinical data for their possible prognostic value. Results: In total, 78 patients (mean age 61±11years) were included. Of these, 9 patients (11%) had an adverse outcome including SFTP recurrence (n=6) or SFTP-related death (n=3). Mean overall survival was 172±13months. 1 and 10-year event-free survival rates were 99% and 93%. In the multivariable analysis only MIB-1 proliferation index (Ki-67) ≥10% (HR 12.3, CI 1.1-139.5, p=0.043), ≥4 mitoses per 10 high power fields (HR 36.5, CI 1.2-1103.7, p=0.039) and tumor size larger than 10cm (HR 81.8, CI 1.7-4016.8, p=0.027) were independently associated with adverse outcome. Conclusion: A high proliferation rate by MIB-1 IHC was associated with impaired outcome. Upon this, we established a new score using mitosis, necrosis, size of the tumor and MIB-1, which performed better than the traditional scores in our data set. This prognostic score could help to better evaluate outcome of SFTP, but requires external validation. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "ZMYND11 (zinc finger MYND-type containing 11) has been widely regarded to be involved in a variety of cancers as a potential suppressor. However, the biological role and mechanism of ZMYND11 in glioblastoma multiform (GBM) remain unknown. In this study, we found that ZMYND11 expression was remarkably decreased in GBM tissues from 20 cases and cell line (U87) compared to normal brain tissue from 10 cases (P < 0.001). Furthermore, we explored that ZMYND11 upregulation significantly suppressed U87 cells proliferation and invasion, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Subsequently, we identified increased ZMYND11 inhibited the tumor growth using tumor cells xenograft experiment on rude mice. Moreover, we explored that ZMYND11 was a new direct and functional target of miR-196a-5p in U87 via luciferase reporter assay. In addition, we confirmed the negative correlation between miR-196a-5p and ZMYND11 in GBM tissue and U87 cells by changing the expression level of miR-196a-5p with lentivirus and plasmid vector. Furthermore, we demonstrated that decreased ZMYND11 could reverse suppressive effect of downregulated miR-196a-5p on U87 by rescue experiment. Taken together, ZMYND11 was demonstrated to be a potential and extremely promising suppressor of GBM, while miRNA-196a-5p was quite an important target of treatment of GBM. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study is to determine the effect of hypoxia on axitinib and sorafenib-treated renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. Hypoxia is a crucial factor influencing transcription process via protein modulation, which was shown i.e. in pancreatic cancer. Until now, hypoxia has been defined as associated with poorer outcome and inducing chemotherapy resistance in solid tumors. The unique phenomenon of pseudo-hypoxia connected with vhl mutation was observed in clear-cell, but not in papillary RCC, and the treatment of this subtype of cancer is still challenging. Despite the introduction of new antiangiogenic targeted therapies (inter alia tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs), patients still develop both primary and acquired resistance. Overcoming resistance to TKIs, also in papillary RCC, may be possible by finding significantly modified protein expression. To do this, hypoxic 3D in vitro models must be developed to mimic both molecular pathways typical for low oxygen tension and cell-cell dynamics in tumor-like spatial structures. Results: Clear-cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma (cc and pRCC) cell lines were used in the study to determine the impact of hypoxia on primary drug resistance phenomenon previously observed in papillary, but not in ccRCC. Resistance was confirmed in monolayer culture and in 3D models in soft agar and suspension culture. Human papillary kidney cancer stem-like cells (HKCSCs) cultured in hypoxia developed resistance to sorafenib, while when cultured in normoxia resistance to axitinib has developed. Flow cytometry revealed that hypoxia decreased proliferation rates in all investigated RCC cells. In HKCSCs, there was an increase of quiescent cells (Ki67-) and percentage of cells arrested in S phase. It also appeared that map2k1 and eif4b protein expression is altered in papillary RCC resistant to tested drugs at different oxygen tensions. Also, HKCSCs did not express vegfr-1, braf nor c-kit, TKIs target receptors, which were present in ccRCC cells sensitive to TKI treatment. Conclusions: The results confirm that low oxygen tension affects RCC cells. Hypoxia facilitates induction of sorafenib resistance in pRCC and induces map2k1 overexpression, while normoxic axitinib-resistant cells up-regulated eif4b. Further studies may determine if map2k1 or eif4b proteins play a role in pRCC resistance to TKIs. It is also of interest to establish if other than vegfr-1, braf, c-kit receptors can serve as potential molecular targets for more effective anti-RCC strategies. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 6 (TRIP6), a member of LIM family, acts as an adaptor protein and is overexpressed in several tumor types. However, the clinical significance and biological role of TRIP6 in HCC remains unknown. In our study, we found that TRIP6 was markedly overexpressed in HCC cells and clinical specimens compared with normal hepatocytes and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Immunohistochemical and statistical analysis showed that the expression of TRIP6 significantly correlated with HCC patients’ clinical stage and poor survival. Moreover, we demonstrated that overexpressing TRIP6 significantly enhanced, whereas silencing endogenous TRIP6 inhibited, the proliferation and the anchorage-independent growth ability of HCC cells. In addition, overexpression of TRIP6 accelerated, while inhibition of TRIP6 retarded, G1-S phase transition in HCC cells. We further found that overexpression of TRIP6 increased the activation of AKT and suppressed the transactivity of FOXO3a. Meanwhile, overexpression of TRIP6 leaded to the decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 Cip1 and p27 Kip1 and increased expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. While silencing TRIP6 triggered the opposite effect. Taken together, these findings showed that TRIP6 plays an important role in promoting HCC cells proliferation and may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: New systemic chemotherapy agents have improved prognosis in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM), but some of them damage the liver parenchyma and ultimately increase postoperative morbidity and mortality after liver resection. The aims of our study were to determine the degree of hemodynamic and pathological liver injury in CLM patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy and to identify an association between these injuries and postoperative complications after liver resection. Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study of patients with CLM receiving preoperative chemotherapy before curative liver resection from November 2013 to June 2014. All patients had preoperative elastography and hepatic hemodynamic evaluation. We analyzed clinical preoperative data and postoperative outcomes after grouping the patients by chemotherapy type, development of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS), and development of major complications. Results: Eleven from the 20 patients included in the study received preoperative oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (OBC). Nine patients had SOS at pathological analysis and five patients developed major complications. Patients receiving preoperative OBC had higher values of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and developed more SOS and major complications. Patients developing SOS had higher values of HVPG and developed more major complications. Patients with major complications had higher values of HVPG, and patients with a HVPG of 5mmHg or greater had more major complications than those under 5mmHg (20 vs 80%, p=0.005). Conclusions: OBC and SOS impair liver hemodynamics in CLM patients. An increase in major complications after liver resection in these patients develops at subclinical HVPG levels. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is regarded as the most common malignant brain tumor but treatment options are limited. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for compounds and corresponding targets that could inhibit GBM growth. We screened a library of 80 dopaminergic ligands with the aim of identifying compounds capable of inhibiting GBM cell line proliferation and survival. Out of 45 active compounds, 8 were further validated. We found that the dopamine receptor D2 antagonist trifluoperazine 2HCl inhibits growth and proliferation of GBM cells in a dose dependent manner. Trifluoperazine's inhibition of GBM cells is cell line dependent and correlates with variations in dopamine receptor expression profile. We conclude that components of the dopamine receptor signaling pathways are potential targets for pharmacological interventions of GBM growth. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is an important factor in the development of squamous cell carcinoma. This study examines the impact of UVR exposure pattern on tumor development. Hairless C3.Cg/TifBomTac immunocompetent pigmented mice (n = 351) were irradiated with 12 standard erythema doses (SED)/week, given as 2 SED ×6, 3 SED ×4, 4 SED ×3, or 6 SED ×2 (dose–delivery study) or 0, 0.6, 1.2, 2, 3 or 4 SED ×3/week (dose–response study). All mice were irradiated until development of 3 tumors of 4 mm each. Pigmentation was measured once monthly. In the dose–delivery study, the median time until tumor development was independent of dose fractions. In the dose–response study, higher UVR doses resulted in faster tumor appearance. When the weekly UVR dose was decreased from 12 to 6 SED, the cumulative UVR dose needed for tumor development was reduced by 40%. In conclusion, delivery schedules of a fixed weekly UVR dose did not affect tumor development. When using different weekly UVR doses, longer time to tumor development was observed using lower UVR doses. Lower weekly UVR doses however resulted in lower cumulative UVR doses to induce tumors in hairless pigmented mice. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with an aggressive and highly proliferative activity. Studies had confirmed that HCC cell proliferation is associated with the cell cycle's G1 phase, but the detailed molecular mechanism has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A1 (eEF1A1) is an evolutionarily conserved elongation factor protein and is involved in tumor cell proliferation. However, which phase of the cell cycle is regulated by eEF1A1 to influence cell proliferation in HCC and its detailed molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we observed that eEF1A1 influences HCC cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle's G1 phase. In addition, eEF1A1 influences G1 phase by regulating cyclin D1 expression, promoting HCC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our results indicated that eEF1A1 regulates cyclin D1 expression through STAT1 signaling. STAT1 increases the transcriptional activity of cyclin D1 by binding to the cyclin D1 promoter. Taken together, these findings enabled us to identify a novel mechanism by which eEF1A1 regulates the cell cycle's G1 phase to promote tumor proliferation by regulating cyclin D1 expression through STAT1 signaling in HCC. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Several studies have reported a correlation between antral follicle count by conventional 2D transvaginal sonography and serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels. However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of 3D SonoAVC transvaginal ultrasound technology, particularly in infertile women. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the usefulness of three-dimensional (3D) SonoAVC transvaginal ultrasound technology for antral follicle count and its correlation to conventional two-dimensional (2D) transvaginal ultrasound and serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone in infertile women. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 42 infertile women with age lower than 40years that underwent treatment at a private fertility clinic between June and December 2015. Patient data included age, body mass index and cause of infertility. On cycle day 3 the following hormone levels were measured: serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, cancer antigen 125, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone and oestradiol; the number of antral follicles was counted as well. The scanning were performed through 2D and 3D technology transvaginal ultrasound. Results: Using a Bland-Altman test we demonstrated that both technologies are quite equivalent. However, antral follicle count is higher using 3D ultrasound technology compared to 2D technology (p<0.001; Wilcoxon test), this finding is mainly remarkable in ovaries with more than 20 antral follicles. Moreover, the mean time required for manual 2D ultrasound and 3D SonoAVC measurements were 275±109 and 103±57s, respectively (p<0.001). Serum AMH concentration correlated to the total number of early antral follicles (correlation coefficients=0.678 and 0.612; p<0.001 by 2D ultrasound and 3D SonoAVC, respectively; Spearman's correlation test). Conclusions: Antral follicle count is better estimated using 3D ultrasound compared to 2D technology. A great advantage of 3D SonoAVC was less time required for an examination and the visual advantage when it need to count more than 20 follicles. Trial registration:CAAE: 35141114.4.0000.5327.

    "Abstract": "Because cancer registry data provide a census of cancer cases, registry data can be used to: 1) define and monitor cancer incidence at the local, state, and national levels; 2) investigate patterns of cancer treatment; and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of public health efforts to prevent cancer cases and improve cancer survival. The purpose of this article is to provide a broad overview of the history of cancer surveillance programs in the United States, and illustrate the expanding ways in which cancer surveillance data are being made available and contributing to cancer control programs. The article describes the building of the cancer registry infrastructure and the successful coordination of efforts among the 2 federal agencies that support cancer registry programs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. The major US cancer control programs also are described, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, and the Colorectal Cancer Control Program. This overview illustrates how cancer registry data can inform public health actions to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes and may be instructional for a variety of cancer control professionals in the United States and in other countries.

    "Abstract": "CONCORD is a programme for the global surveillance of cancer survival. In 2015, the second cycle of the program (CONCORD-2) established long-term surveillance of cancer survival worldwide, for the first time, in the largest cancer survival study published to date. CONCORD-2 provided cancer survival trends for 25,676,887 patients diagnosed during the 15-year period between 1995 and 2009 with 1 of 10 common cancers that collectively represented 63% of the global cancer burden in 2009. Herein, the authors summarize the past, describe the present, and outline the future of the CONCORD programme. They discuss the difference between population-based studies and clinical trials, and review the importance of international comparisons of population-based cancer survival. This study will focus on the United States. The authors explain why population-based survival estimates are crucial for driving effective cancer control strategies to reduce the wide and persistent disparities in cancer survival between white and black patients, which are likely to be attributable to differences in access to early diagnosis and optimal treatment.

    "Abstract": "Both diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer are common diseases and they frequently occur in the same patients. We investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality dynamics in relation to baseline DM, statin use and metformin use. The study population consisted of 39,900 incident cancer cases from Finland, 19,822 patients were free of DM at the start of follow-up and 20,078 had DM. Mortality from all causes, and cancer, cardiovascular (CVD) and other causes was analysed using Poisson regression model with the following variables: sex, age, DM, statin and metformin usage in baseline, cancer type and stage and calendar period. Statin usage was associated with a reduced cancer-specific mortality with incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69–0.74), IRR for CVD mortality was 0.95 (0.88–1.02) and for other causes 0.64 (0.56–0.74). In a sub-population of DM patients, IRR for metformin in all-cause mortality was 0.74 (0.71–0.78), in cancer mortality 0.75 (0.72–0.79), in CVD mortality 0.75 (0.68–0.83) and other causes 0.68 (0.60–0.78). In conclusion, our register-based study of survival after cancer diagnosis showed that patients with diabetes had substantially poorer outcome in all measures. An association between baseline statin usage and lower all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular mortality was modified by cancer type. The effect of statin use was largest for breast and colorectal cancer. Metformin usage in a subpopulation of oral antidiabetic users was in general associated with lower mortality, but this association was modified by cancer type. The association was strongest for liver, colorectal and breast cancer. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Robust comparisons of population-based cancer survival estimates require tight adherence to the study protocol, standardized quality control, appropriate life tables of background mortality, and centralized analysis. The CONCORD program established worldwide surveillance of population-based cancer survival in 2015, analyzing individual data on 26 million patients (including 10 million US patients) diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 with 1 of 10 common malignancies. METHODS: In this Cancer supplement, we analyzed data from 37 state cancer registries that participated in the second cycle of the CONCORD program (CONCORD-2), covering approximately 80% of the US population. Data quality checks were performed in 3 consecutive phases: protocol adherence, exclusions, and editorial checks. One-, 3-, and 5-year age-standardized net survival was estimated using the Pohar Perme estimator and state- and race-specific life tables of all-cause mortality for each year. The cohort approach was adopted for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003, and the complete approach for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. RESULTS: Articles in this supplement report population coverage, data quality indicators, and age-standardized 5-year net survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis. Examples of tables, bar charts, and funnel plots are provided in this article. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based cancer survival is a key measure of the overall effectiveness of services in providing equitable health care. The high quality of US cancer registry data, 80% population coverage, and use of an unbiased net survival estimator ensure that the survival trends reported in this supplement are robustly comparable by race and state. The results can be used by policymakers to identify and address inequities in cancer survival in each state and for the United States nationally. Cancer 2017;123:4982-93. Published 2017.

    "Abstract": "Cancer survival rates are lower in Denmark than in comparable European countries. This may partly be attributable to subgroups of cancer patients who seek medical attention at late disease stages. It is unknown if differences in usual (i.e. customary) consultation frequency in general practice are associated with cancer prognosis. We aimed to estimate the cancer prognosis of cancer patients stratified by their usual consultation frequency in general practice. We performed a population-based cohort study including 123,943 incident cancer patients aged 50 to 89 years diagnosed in Denmark in 2009 to 2013. We estimated associations between the patient's usual general practitioner (GP) consultation frequency 19 to 36 months before the cancer diagnosis and all-cause mortality by using hazard ratios (HR), estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression. We also estimated the associations between the patient's usual GP consultation frequency and tumour stage, by using logistic regression estimates of odds ratios (ORs). Patients who usually did not see their GP (non-consulters) had higher all-cause mortality [HR = 1.39 (95% CI: 1.33–1.44)] compared to patients who usually saw their GP three to five times during an 18 months period (average consulters). Non-consulters had higher odds of having distant tumour stage [OR = 1.46 (95% CI: 1.38–1.57)] than average consulters. Similar, yet less strong, patterns were seen among patients with low usual GP consultation frequency, yet not statistically significant for all cancer types. In conclusion, the association between usual GP non-consultation and cancer prognosis is a combination of at least two things: a mechanism through more advanced tumour stage and other independent factors. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Adult height has been positively associated with breast cancer risk. The timing of pubertal growth—as measured by age at menarche and age at attained height—may also influence risk. We evaluated associations of adult height, age at attained height, and age at menarche with incidence of invasive breast cancer in 55,687 African American women in the prospective Black Women's Health Study. Over 20 years, 1,826 invasive breast cancers [1,015 estrogen receptor (ER) positive; 542 ER negative] accrued. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with breast cancer overall and by ER status, mutually adjusted for the three factors of interest. Adult height was associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer (HR for ≥70 inches vs ≤63 inches: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.89) but not ER− (corresponding HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.71) (p heterogeneity = 0.34). HRs for attained height before age 13 versus age >17 were 1.30 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.76) for ER+ and 1.25 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.96) for ER− breast cancer. Results for age at menarche (≤11 vs ≥14 years) were similar for ER+ and ER− breast cancer (HR for breast cancer overall: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.50). We confirmed height as a strong risk factor for ER+ breast cancer in African American women and identified early age at attained height as a risk factor for both ER+ and ER− breast cancer, albeit without statistical significance of the latter associations. While adult height and timing of pubertal growth are inter-related, our findings suggest that they may be independent risk factors for breast cancer. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. This study reports ovarian cancer survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis using data from the CONCORD-2 study, the largest and most geographically comprehensive, population-based survival study to date. METHODS: Data from women diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2001 and 2009 from 37 states, covering 80% of the US population, were used in all analyses. Survival was estimated up to 5 years and was age standardized and adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables. RESULTS: Among the 172,849 ovarian cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, more than one-half were diagnosed at distant stage. Five-year net survival was 39.6% between 2001 and 2003 and 41% between 2004 and 2009. Black women had consistently worse survival compared with white women (29.6% from 2001-2003 and 31.1% from 2004-2009), despite similar stage distributions. Stage-specific survival for all races combined between 2004 and 2009 was 86.4% for localized stage, 60.9% for regional stage, and 27.4% for distant stage. CONCLUSIONS: The current data demonstrate a large and persistent disparity in ovarian cancer survival among black women compared with white women in most states. Clinical and public health efforts that ensure all women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer receive appropriate, guidelines-based treatment may help to decrease these disparities. Future research that focuses on the development of new methods or modalities to detect ovarian cancer at early stages, when survival is relatively high, will likely improve overall US ovarian cancer survival.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reducing breast cancer incidence and achieving equity in breast cancer outcomes remains a priority for public health practitioners, health care providers, policy makers, and health advocates. Monitoring breast cancer survival can help evaluate the effectiveness of health services, quantify inequities in outcomes between states or population subgroups, and inform efforts to improve the effectiveness of cancer management and treatment. METHODS: We analyzed breast cancer survival using individual patient records from 37 statewide registries that participated in the CONCORD-2 study, covering approximately 80% of the US population. Females were diagnosed between 2001 and 2009 and were followed through December 31, 2009. Age-standardized net survival at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after diagnosis was estimated by state, race (white, black), stage at diagnosis, and calendar period (2001-2003 and 2004-2009). RESULTS: Overall, 5-year breast cancer net survival was very high (88.2%). Survival remained remarkably high from 2001 through 2009. Between 2001 and 2003, survival was 89.1% for white females and 76.9% for black females. Between 2004 and 2009, survival was 89.6% for white females and 78.4% for black females. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survival was more than 10 percentage points lower for black females than for white females, and this difference persisted over time. Reducing racial disparities in survival remains a challenge that requires broad, coordinated efforts at the federal, state, and local levels. Monitoring trends in breast cancer survival can highlight populations in need of improved cancer management and treatment. Cancer 2017;123:5100-18. Published 2017.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased very rapidly in Korea; however, most previous studies suggested that the mortality rate for thyroid cancer remained stable. The objective of the current study was to evaluate recent changes in standardized thyroid cancer mortality using data from Statistics Korea. METHODS: Population and mortality data from 1985 through 2015 were obtained from Statistics Korea. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) from thyroid cancer per 100,000 population were calculated based on the World Health Organization standard population. RESULTS: In Korea, the ASMRs from thyroid cancer increased from 0.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.18) per 100,000 in 1985 to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83-0.86) per 100,000 in 2004, which was the highest among all countries. Subsequently, the ASMRs continuously decreased to 0.42 (95% CI, 0.41-0.43) per 100,000 between 2004 and 2015. The estimated annual percent change (APC) from 1985 to 2004 was 7.94 (95% CI, 6.43-9.46), and the corresponding value from 2004 to 2015 was −4.10 (95% CI, −5.76 to −2.40). Changes in the ASMRs reflected similar patterns in men (1985-2003: APC, 8.51; 2003-2015: APC, −4.32) and women (1985-2004: APC, 7.62; 2004-2015: APC, −4.38) and were also observed in older patients (aged ≥ 55 years). CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid cancer mortality in Korea increased until 2004 and then continuously decreased until 2015. Increases in the early diagnosis of thyroid cancer, changes in exposure to risk factors, and standardization in diagnosis and treatment may be associated with the decrease in thyroid cancer mortality in Korea.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Steroidal androgens suppress androgen receptor and estrogen receptor positive (AR/ER+) breast cancer cells and were used to treat breast cancer, eliciting favorable response. The current study evaluates the activity and efficacy of the oral selective AR modulator RAD140 in in vivo and in vitro models of AR/ER+ breast cancer. Experimental Design: A series of in vitro assays were used to determine the affinity of RAD140 to 4 nuclear receptors and evaluate its tissue-selective AR activity. The efficacy and pharmacodynamics of RAD140 as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib were evaluated in AR/ER+ breast cancer xenograft models. Results: RAD140 bound AR with high affinity and specificity and activatedARin breast cancer but not prostate cancer cells. Oral administration of RAD140 substantially inhibited the growth of AR/ER+ breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Activation of AR and suppression of ER pathway, including the ESR1 gene, were seen with RAD140 treatment. Coadministration of RAD140 and palbociclib showed improved efficacy in the AR/ER+ PDX models. In line with efficacy, a subset of AR-repressed genes associated with DNA replication was suppressed with RAD140 treatment, an effect apparently enhanced by concurrent administration of palbociclib. Conclusions: RAD140 is a potent AR agonist in breast cancer cells with a distinct mechanism of action, including the ARmediated repression of ESR1. It inhibits the growth of multiple AR/ER+ breast cancer PDX models as a single agent, and in combination with palbociclib. The preclinical data presented here support further clinical investigation of RAD140 in AR/ER+ breast cancer patients. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

Items included socio-demographic and work-related characteristics; self-assessed knowledge of oral cancer; perceived level of confidence in discussing oral health behaviors with patients; oral cancer screening practices; and self-evaluated need for additional training on screening procedures for oral cancer. Results: A total of 380 OHPs responded this survey, achieving an overall response rate of 9.4%. Forty-five were excluded from further analysis. Of these 335 OHP, 72% were dentists; (n=241); either GDP or Dental Specialists; 13.7% (n=46) were dental hygienists; 12.2% (n=41) were oral health therapists, and the remaining 2.1% (n=7) were dental therapists. While the majority (95.2%) agreed that oral cancer screening should be routinely performed, in actual practice around half (51.4%) screened all their patients. Another 12.8% \"Very rarely\" conducted screening examinations. The probability of routinely conducting an oral cancer screening was explored utilising Logistic Regression Analysis. Four variables remained statistically significant (p<0.0001). Results indicate that the likelihood of conducting an oral cancer screening rose with increasing levels of OHPs' confidence in oral cancer-related knowledge (OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.09-1.67) and with higher levels of confidence in discussing oral hygiene practices with patients (OR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.03-1.52). Results also showed that dental specialists were less likely to perform oral cancer screening examinations compared with other OHPs (OR=0.18; 95% CI: 0.07-0.52) and the likelihood of performing an oral cancer screening decreased when the \"patient complained of a problem\" (OR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.10-0.44). Conclusion: Only half the study sample performed oral cancer screening examinations for all of their patients. This study provides evidence of the need for further oral cancer-related education and screening training for OHPs, which is vital to enhance oral cancer prevention and early detection. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stomach cancer was a leading cause of cancer-related deaths early in the 20th century and has steadily declined over the last century in the United States. Although incidence and death rates are now low, stomach cancer remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in black, Asian and Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations. METHODS: Data from the CONCORD-2 study were used to analyze stomach cancer survival among males and females aged 15 to 99 years who were diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival analyses were corrected for background mortality using state-specific and race-specific (white and black) life tables and age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Net survival is presented up to 5 years after diagnosis by race (all, black, and white) for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Summary Stage 2000 data from 2004. RESULTS: Almost one-third of stomach cancers were diagnosed at a distant stage among both whites and blacks. Age-standardized 5-year net survival increased between 2001 to 2003 and 2004 to 2009 (26.1% and 29%, respectively), and no differences were observed by race. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival estimates were 53.1%, 33.8%, and 29%, respectively. Survival improved in most states. Survival by stage was 64% (local), 28.2% (regional), and 5.3% (distant). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate high fatality for stomach cancer, especially soon after diagnosis. Although improvements in stomach cancer survival were observed, survival remained relatively low for both blacks and whites. Primary prevention through the control of well-established risk factors would be expected to have the greatest impact on further reducing deaths from stomach cancer. Cancer 2017;123:4994-5013.

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancers comprise a complex mixture of malignant cells, nontransformed cells, and microorganisms. Fusobacterium nucleatum is among the most prevalent bacterial species in colorectal cancer tissues. Here we show that colonization of human colorectal cancers with Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome-including Bacteroides, Selenomonas, and Prevotella species-is maintained in distal metastases, demonstrating microbiome stability between paired primary and metastatic tumors. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Fusobacterium is predominantly associated with cancer cells in the metastatic lesions. Mouse xenografts of human primary colorectal adenocarcinomas were found to retain viable Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome through successive passages. Treatment of mice bearing a colon cancer xenograft with the antibiotic metronidazole reduced Fusobacterium load, cancer cell proliferation, and overall tumor growth. These observations argue for further investigation of antimicrobial interventions as a potential treatment for patients with Fusobacterium-associated colorectal cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer cells require increased aerobic glycolysis to support rapid cell proliferation. For their increased energy demands, cancer cells express glucose transporter (Glut) proteins at a high level. Glut1 is associated with basal-like breast cancer and is considered a potential therapeutic target. To investigate the possibility of Glut1 as a therapeutic target in breast cancer cells, we downregulated Glut1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines using a short hairpin system. We determined whether Glut1 silencing might enhance anti-proliferative effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Contrary to our hypothesis, ablation of Glut1 attenuated apoptosis and increased drug resistance via upregulation of p-Akt/p-GSK-3β (Ser9)/β-catenin/survivin. These results indicated that the potential of Glut1 as a therapeutic target should be carefully reevaluated. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: More extensive surgical treatments for early stage breast cancer are increasing. The patterns of preoperative MRI overall and by stage for this trend has not been well established. Methods: Using Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium registry data from 2010 through 2014, we identified women with an incident non-metastatic breast cancer and determined use of preoperative MRI and initial surgical treatment (mastectomy, with or without contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM), reconstruction, and breast conserving surgery ± radiation). Clinical and sociodemographic covariates were included in multivariable logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Of the 13 097 women, 2217 (16.9%) had a preoperative MRI. Among the women with MRI, results indicated 32% higher odds of unilateral mastectomy compared to breast conserving surgery and of mastectomy with CPM compared to unilateral mastectomy. Women with preoperative MRI also had 56% higher odds of reconstruction. Conclusion: Preoperative MRI in women with DCIS and early stage invasive breast cancer is associated with more frequent mastectomy, CPM, and reconstruction surgical treatment. Use of more extensive surgical treatment and reconstruction among women with DCIS and early stage invasive cancer whom undergo MRI warrants further investigation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Worldwide, liver cancer is a leading cause of death for both men and women. The number of Americans who are diagnosed with and die of liver cancer has been rising slowly each year. Using data from the CONCORD-2 study, this study examined population-based survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis. METHODS: Data from 37 statewide registries, which covered 81% of the US population, for patients diagnosed during 2001-2009 were analyzed. Survival up to 5 years was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) with state- and race-specific life tables, and it was age-standardized with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. RESULTS: Liver cancer was diagnosed overall more often at the localized stage, with blacks being more often diagnosed at distant and regional stages than whites. 5-year net survival was 12.2% in 2001-2003 and 14.8% in 2004-2009. Whites had higher survival than blacks in both calendar periods (11.7% vs 9.1% and 14.3% vs 11.4%, respectively). During 2004-2009, 5-year survival was 25.7% for localized-stage disease, 9.5% for regional-stage disease, and 3.5% for distant-stage disease. CONCLUSIONS: Some progress has occurred in survival for patients with liver cancer, but 5-year survival remains low, even for those diagnosed at the localized stage. Efforts directed at controlling well-established risk factors such as hepatitis B may have the greatest impact on reducing the burden of liver cancer in the United States. Cancer 2017;123:5059-78.

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Nodal positivity following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered a poor prognostic sign, but little data are available on the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in these cases. This analysis sought to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with increased survival in NSCLC patients with residual N1 disease at resection. Methods: Patients from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) with cN1T1-2M0 NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and definitive resection between 2006 and 2012 were identified. Treatment groups were defined as those receiving no additional therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy ± radiation after resection. Five-year overall survival (OS) was estimated for each group. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate hazard ratios adjusting for demographic, clinical, and facility characteristics. Results: Among 90 eligible patients, 5-year OS was 43% and 56% for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and no additional treatment, respectively (P < 0.56). With multivariable analysis, the estimated hazard ratio was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.61-2.64, P = 0.51) for adjuvant chemotherapy compared to no additional therapy. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy is not associated with increased survival in NSCLC patients with pathologic N1 NSCLC following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and resection. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms supporting tumor-initiating cells (TIC) is vital to combat advanced-stage recurrent cancers. Here, we show that in advanced ovarian cancers NFkB signaling via the RelB transcription factor supports TIC populations by directly regulating the cancer stem-like associated enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Loss of RelB significantly inhibited spheroid formation, ALDH expression and activity, chemoresistance, and tumorigenesis in subcutaneous and intrabursal mouse xenograft models of human ovarian cancer. RelB also affected expression of the ALDH gene ALDH1A2. Interestingly, classical NFkB signaling through the RelA transcription factor was equally important for tumorigenesis in the intrabursal model, but had no effect on ALDH. In this case, classical signaling via RelA was essential for proliferating cells, whereas the alternative signaling pathway was not. Our results show how NFkB sustains diverse cancer phenotypes via distinct classical and alternative signaling pathways, with implications for improved understanding of disease recurrence and therapeutic response. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: We examined the association between metabolic dysregulation and cancer mortality in a prospective cohort of Black and White adults. Methods: A total of 25,038 Black and White adults were included in the analysis. Metabolic dysregulation was defined in two ways: 1) using the joint harmonized criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 2) based on factor analysis of 15 variables characterizing metabolic dysregulation. We estimated hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of MetS and metabolic dysregulation with cancer mortality during follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: About 46% of Black and 39% of White participants met the criteria for MetS. Overall, participants with MetS (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.45) were at increased risk of cancer-related death. In race-stratified analysis, Black participants with MetS had significantly increased risk of cancer mortality compared with those without MetS (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.72), increasing to more than a 2-fold risk of cancer mortality among those with five metabolic syndrome components (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.01-5.51). Conclusions: There are marked racial differences in the prevalence of metabolic dysregulation defined as MetS based on the harmonized criteria. The strong positive associations between MetS and cancer mortality suggests that efforts to improve cancer outcomes in general, and racial disparities in cancer outcomes specifically, may benefit from prevention and management of MetS and its components. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Takotsubo syndrome, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SC), is underrecognized in cancer patients. This study aims to investigate the incidence, natural history, and triggers of SC in cancer patients and its impact on cancer therapy and overall survival. A total of 30 subjects fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for SC at MD Anderson Cancer Center over a 6-year period. Clinical presentation, electrocardiogram, laboratory data, and transthoracic echocardiogram results registered during the acute phase and follow-up were collected. All patients underwent coronary angiography. The most frequent presenting symptoms were chest pain in 63.3% of the patients and shortness of breath/dyspnea on exertion in 27% of the patients. T-wave inversion was a more common electrocardiographic presentation (60%) than ST elevation (13.3%). The median and interquartile range of peak creatine kinase MB fraction, troponin I, and brain natriuretic peptide were creatine kinase MB fraction 8.9, 4.6 to 21.1; troponin I 1.31, 0.7 to 3.3; and brain natriuretic peptide 1,124, 453.5 to 2,369.5. The most common complication of SC was cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic agents (20%). Of the 21 patients who required ongoing cancer treatment, 16 were able to resume chemotherapy, 5 underwent surgery, and 4 received radiation treatment. Median time to resume cancer treatment was 20 days after SC. None of the patients experienced recurrence of SC and other cardiac events. In conclusion, SC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cancer patients who present with chest pain and ECG findings characteristic of acute coronary syndrome. Most of these patients normalize ejection fraction and may resume cancer therapy early. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Approximately 20-40% of stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop relapse. Clinicopathological factors alone are limited in detecting these patients, resulting in potential under/over-treatment. We sought to identify a prognostic tumor mutational profile that could predict CRC recurrence. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing data were obtained for 207 patients with stage II/III CRC from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Mutational landscape in relapse-free versus relapsed cohort was compared using Fisher's exact test, followed by multivariate Cox regression to identify genes associated with cancer recurrence. Bootstrap-validation was used to examine internal/external validity. Results: We identified five prognostic genes (APAF1, DIAPH2, NTNG1, USP7, and VAV2), which were combined to form a prognostic mutation panel. Patients with ≥1 mutation(s) within this five-gene panel had worse prognosis (3-yr relapse-free survival [RFS]: 53.0%), compared to patients with no mutation (3-yr RFS: 84.3%). In multivariate analysis, the five-gene panel remained prognostic for cancer recurrence independent of stage and high-risk features (hazard ratio 3.63, 95%CI [1.93-6.83], P < 0.0001). Furthermore, its prognostic accuracy was superior to the American Joint Commission on Cancer classification (concordance-index: 0.70 vs 0.54). Conclusions: Our proposed mutation panel identifies CRC patients at high-risk for recurrence, which may help guide adjuvant therapy and post-operative surveillance protocols. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of health insurance on childhood cancer survival has not been well studied. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, this study was designed to assess the association between health insurance status and childhood cancer survival. METHODS: Data on cancers diagnosed among children less than 15 years old from 2007 to 2009 were obtained from the SEER 18 registries. The effect of health insurance at diagnosis on 5-year childhood cancer mortality was estimated with marginal survival probabilities, restricted mean survival times, and Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and county-level poverty. RESULTS: Among 8219 childhood cancer cases, the mean survival time was 1.32 months shorter (95% confidence interval [CI], −4.31 to 1.66) after 5 years for uninsured children (n = 131) versus those with private insurance (n = 4297), whereas the mean survival time was 0.62 months shorter (95% CI, −1.46 to 0.22) for children with Medicaid at diagnosis (n = 2838). In Cox PH models, children who were uninsured had a 1.26-fold higher risk of cancer death (95% CI, 0.84-1.90) than those who were privately insured at diagnosis. The risk for those with Medicaid was similar to the risk for those with private insurance at diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.93-1.21). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggest that cancer survival is largely similar for children with Medicaid and those with private insurance at diagnosis. Slightly inferior survival was observed for those who were uninsured in comparison with those with private insurance at diagnosis. The latter result is based on a small number of uninsured children and should be interpreted cautiously. Further study is needed to confirm and clarify the reasons for these patterns.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma has a favorable prognosis, but patients with multiple recurrences have drastically lower survival. Filipinos in the United States are known to have high rates of thyroid cancer incidence and disease recurrence. To the authors' knowledge, it is unknown whether Filipinos also have higher thyroid cancer mortality rates. METHODS: The authors studied thyroid cancer mortality in Filipino, non-Filipino Asian (NFA), and non-Hispanic white (NHW) adults using US death records (2003-2012) and US Census data. Age-adjusted mortality rates and proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated. Sex, nativity status, age at death, and educational attainment also were examined. RESULTS: The authors examined 19,940,952 deaths. The age-adjusted mortality rates due to thyroid cancer were highest in Filipinos (1.72 deaths per 100,000 population; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.51-1.95) compared with NFAs (1.03 per 100,000 population; 95% CI, 0.95-1.12) and NHWs (1.17 per 100,000 population; 95% CI, 1.16-1.18). Compared with NHWs, higher proportionate mortality was observed in Filipino women (3-5 times higher) across all age groups, and among Filipino men, the PMR was 2 to 3 times higher in the subgroup aged >55 years. Filipinos who completed a higher educational level had a notably higher PMR (5.0) compared with their counterparts who had not (3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Negative prognostic factors for thyroid cancer traditionally include age >45 years and male sex. The results of the current study demonstrate that Filipinos die of thyroid cancer at higher rates than NFA and NHW individuals of similar ages. Highly educated Filipinos and Filipino women may be especially at risk of poor thyroid cancer outcomes. Filipino ethnicity should be factored into clinical decision making in the management of patients with thyroid cancer.

    "Abstract": "Stroke prediction scores have not been validated in patients with cancer and atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to identify unique risk factors and evaluate validity of CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores to predict risk of stroke and mortality. A retrospective review of all patients with cancer with pre-existing AF presenting from 2008 to 2014 was performed. Outcomes included ischemic stroke and mortality. Prognostic factors were identified with Fine and Gray regression for stroke and Cox proportional hazards analysis for survival. After excluding patients with hemorrhagic strokes, 2,037 patients were analyzed. Genitourinary cancers were the most common (29%) followed by gastrointestinal cancers (18%). Overall, 52% had CHADS2 ≥2. At a median of 6.4 months, 74 patients (3.6%) developed an ischemic stroke. Increased CHADS2 score was associated with stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19 to 1.67; p <0.001). © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Motivation: To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in cancer development, significant efforts are being invested in cancer research. This has resulted in millions of scientific articles. An efficient and thorough review of the existing literature is crucially important to drive new research. This time-demanding task can be supported by emerging computational approaches based on text mining which offer a great opportunity to organize and retrieve the desired information efficiently from sizable databases. One way to organize existing knowledge on cancer is to utilize the widely accepted framework of the Hallmarks of Cancer. These hallmarks refer to the alterations in cell behaviour that characterize the cancer cell. Results: We created an extensive Hallmarks of Cancer taxonomy and developed automatic text mining methodology and a tool (CHAT) capable of retrieving and organizing millions of cancerrelated references from PubMed into the taxonomy. The efficiency and accuracy of the tool was evaluated intrinsically as well as extrinsically by case studies. The correlations identified by the tool show that it offers a great potential to organize and correctly classify cancer-related literature. Furthermore, the tool can be useful, for example, in identifying hallmarks associated with extrinsic factors, biomarkers and therapeutics targets. © The Author 2017.

    "Abstract": "Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are potent regulators of gene expression and cellular phenotype. Each miRNA has the potential to target hundreds of transcripts within the cell thus controlling fundamental cellular processes such as survival and proliferation. Here, we exploit this important feature of miRNA networks to discover vulnerabilities in cancer phenotype, and map miRNA-target relationships across different cancer types. More specifically, we report the results of a functional genomics screen of 1280 miRNA mimics and inhibitors in eight cancer cell lines, and its presentation in a sophisticated interactive data portal. This resource represents the most comprehensive survey of miRNA function in oncology, incorporating breast cancer, prostate cancer and neuroblastoma. A user-friendly web portal couples this experimental data with multiple tools for miRNA target prediction, pathway enrichment analysis and visualization. In addition, the database integrates publicly available gene expression and perturbation data enabling tailored and context-specific analysis of miRNA function in a particular disease. As a proof-of-principle, we use the database and its innovative features to uncover novel determinants of the neuroblastoma malignant phenotype. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Inhibition of PACE4, a proprotein convertase that is overexpressed in prostate cancer, has been shown to block cancer progression in an androgen-independent manner. However, the basis for its overexpression and its growth-inhibitory effects are mitigated and uncertain. Here, we report that PACE4 pre-mRNA undergoes DNA methylation–sensitive alternative splicing of its terminal exon 30 untranslated region, generating an oncogenic, C-terminally modified isoform (PACE4-altCT). We found this isoform to be strongly expressed in prostate cancer cells, where it displayed an enhanced autoactivating process and a distinct intracellular routing that prevented its extracellular secretion. Together, these events led to a dramatic increase in processing of the progrowth differentiation factor pro-GDF15 as the first PACE4 substrate to be identified in prostate cancer. We detected robust expression of PACE4-altCT in other cancer types, suggesting that an oncogenic switch for this proenzyme may offer a therapeutic target not only in advanced prostate cancer but perhaps also more broadly in human cancer. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small, noncoding RNA molecules with a master role in the regulation of important tasks in different critical processes of cancer pathogenesis. Because there are different miRNAs implicated in all the stages of cancer, for example, functioning as oncogenes, this makes these small molecules suitable targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy. RNA-mediated interference has been one major approach for sequence-specific regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Recently, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 system, first identified in bacteria and archaea as an adaptive immune response to invading genetic material, has been explored as a sequence-specific molecular tool for editing genomic sequences for basic research in life sciences and for therapeutic purposes. There is growing evidence that small noncoding RNAs, including miRNAs, can be targeted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system despite their lacking an open reading frame to evaluate functional loss. Thus, CRISPR/Cas9 technology represents a novel gene-editing strategy with compelling robustness, specificity, and stability for the modification of miRNA expression. Here, I summarize key features of current knowledge of genomic editing by CRISPR/Cas9 technology as a feasible strategy for globally interrogating miRNA gene function and miRNA-based therapeutic intervention. Alternative emerging strategies for nonviral delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 core components into human cells in a clinical context are also analyzed critically. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline–adherent initiation of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) and different time-to-PORT intervals on the overall survival (OS) of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was reviewed for the period of 2006-2014, and patients with HNSCC undergoing surgery and PORT were identified. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, Cox regression analysis, and propensity score matching were used to determine the effects of initiating PORT within 6 weeks of surgery and different time-to-PORT intervals on survival. RESULTS: This study included 41,291 patients. After adjustments for covariates, starting PORT >6 weeks postoperatively was associated with decreased OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.19). This finding remained in the propensity score–matched subset (hazard ratio, 1.21; 99% CI, 1.15-1.28). In comparison with starting PORT 5 to 6 weeks postoperatively, initiating PORT earlier was not associated with improved survival (aHR for ≤ 4 weeks, 0.93; 99% CI, 0.85-1.02; aHR for 4-5 weeks, 0.92; 99% CI, 0.84-1.01). Increasing durations of delay beyond 7 weeks were associated with small, progressive survival decrements (aHR, 1.09, 1.10, and 1.12 for 7-8, 8-10, and >10 weeks, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherence to NCCN guidelines for initiating PORT within 6 weeks of surgery was associated with decreased survival. There was no survival benefit to initiating PORT earlier within the recommended 6-week timeframe. Increasing durations of delay beyond 7 weeks were associated with small, progressive survival decrements. Cancer 2017;123:4841-50. © 2017 American Cancer Society. © 2017 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer is most lethal among gynecological cancers with often fatal consequences due to lack of effective biomarkers and relapse, which propels ovarian cancer research into unique directions to establish solid targeted therapeutics. \"Ovarian stem cells\" expressing germline pluripotent markers serve as novel paradigm with potential to address infertility, menopause, and probably influence tumor initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) pose vital role in tumor recurrence and hence it is extremely important to study them with respect to ovarian stem cells across various cancer stages and normal ovaries. Pluripotent (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, SSEA1, and SSEA4), germline (IFITM3, VASA/DDX4), and cancer stem (CD44, LGR5) cell specific markers were characterized for protein and mRNA expression in tumor tissues to understand their distribution in the surface epithelium and ovarian cortex in benign, borderline, and high-grade malignant stages. To elucidate whether pluripotent ovarian germline stem cells and CSCs are common subset of stem cells in tumor tissues, VASA was colocalized with known pluripotent stem (OCT4, SSEA1, SSEA4) and CSC (CD44, LGR5) specific markers by confocal microscopy. Single, smaller spherical (≤5 μm), and larger elliptical fibroblast like (≥10 μm) cells (also in clusters or multiples) were detected implying probable functional behavioral significance of cells in tumor initiation and metastasis across various cancer stages. Cells revealed characteristic staining pattern in ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) and cortex regions exclusive for each marker. Co-expression studies revealed specific subpopulations existing simultaneously in OSE and cortex and that a dynamic hierarchy of (cancer) stem cells with germline properties prevails in normal ovaries and cancer stages. Novel insights into CSC biology with respect to ovarian and germline stem cell perspective were obtained. Understanding molecular signatures and distribution within ovarian tissue may enable identification of precise tumor-initiating CSC populations and signaling pathways thus improving their efficient targeting and strategies to prevent their dissemination causing fatal relapse. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the first CONCORD study (2008), 5-year survival for patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1990 and 1994 in the United States was among the highest in the world (60%), but there were large racial disparities in most participating states. The CONCORD-2 study (2015) enabled the examination of survival trends between 1995 and 2009 for US states by race and stage. METHODS: The authors analyzed data from 37 state population-based cancer registries, covering approximately 80% of the US population, for patients who were diagnosed with colon cancer between 2001 and 2009 and were followed through 2009. Survival up to 5 years was corrected for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables and age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Survival is presented by race (all, black, white), stage, state, and calendar period (2001-2003 and 2004-2009) to account for changes in methods used to collect stage. RESULTS: Five-year net survival increased by 0.9%, from 63.7% between 2001 and 2003 to 64.6% between 2004 and 2009. More black than white patients were diagnosed with distant-stage disease between 2001 and 2003 (21.5% vs 17.2%) and between 2004 and 2009 (23.3% vs 18.8%). Survival improved for both blacks and whites, but 5-year net survival was 9-10% lower for blacks than for whites both between 2001 and 2003 (54.7% vs 64.5%) and between 2004 and 2009 (56.6% vs 65.4%). The absolute difference between blacks and whites decreased by only 1% during the decade. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year net survival from colon cancer increased slightly over time. Survival among blacks diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 had still not reached the level of that among whites diagnosed between 1990 and 1994, some 15 to 20 years earlier. These findings suggest a need for more targeted efforts to improve screening and to ensure timely, appropriate treatment, especially for blacks, to reduce this large and persistent disparity in survival.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) with flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) has been shown to reduce CRC mortality. The current study examined whether the observed mortality reduction was due primarily to the prevention of incident CRC via removal of adenomatous polyps or to the early detection of cancer and improved survival. METHODS: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial randomized 154,900 men and women aged 55 to 74 years. Individuals underwent FS screening at baseline and at 3 or 5 years versus usual care. CRC-specific survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazards modeling. The authors estimated the percentage of CRC deaths averted by early detection versus primary prevention using a model that applied intervention arm survival rates to CRC cases in the usual-care arm and vice versa. RESULTS: A total of 1008 cases of CRC in the intervention arm and 1291 cases of CRC in the usual-care arm were observed. Through 13 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference noted between the trial arms with regard to CRC-specific survival for all CRC (68% in the intervention arm vs 65% in the usual-care arm; P =.16) or proximal CRC (68% vs 62%, respectively; P =.11) cases; however, survival in distal CRC cases was found to be higher in the intervention arm compared with the usual-care arm (77% vs 66%; P<.0001). Within each arm, symptom-detected cases had significantly worse survival compared with screen-detected cases. Overall, approximately 29% to 35% of averted CRC deaths were estimated to be due to early detection and 65% to 71% were estimated to be due to primary prevention. CONCLUSIONS: CRC-specific survival was similar across arms in the PLCO trial, suggesting a limited role for early detection in preventing CRC deaths. Modeling suggested that approximately two-thirds of avoided deaths were due to primary prevention. Future CRC screening guidelines should emphasize primary prevention via the identification and removal of precursor lesions.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Results from the second CONCORD study (CONCORD-2) indicated that 5-year net survival for lung cancer was low (range, 10%-20%) between 1995 and 2009 in most countries, including the United States, which was at the higher end of this range. METHODS: Data from CONCORD-2 were used to analyze net survival among patients with lung cancer (aged 15-99 years) who were diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival was corrected for background mortality using state-specific and race-specific life tables and age-standardized using International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Net survival was estimated for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003 and between 2004 and 2009 at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis by race (all races, black, and white); Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Summary Stage 2000; and US state. RESULTS: Five-year net survival increased from 16.4% (95% confidence interval, 16.3%-16.5%) for patients diagnosed 2001-2003 to 19.0% (18.8%-19.1%) for those diagnosed 2004-2009, with increases in most states and among both blacks and whites. Between 2004 and 2009, 5-year survival was lower among blacks (14.9%) than among whites (19.4%) and ranged by state from 14.5% to 25.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer survival improved slightly between the periods 2001-2003 and 2004-2009 but was still low, with variation between states, and persistently lower survival among blacks than whites. Efforts to control well established risk factors would be expected to have the greatest impact on reducing the burden of lung cancer, and efforts to ensure that all patients receive timely and appropriate treatment should reduce the differences in survival by race and state.

    "Abstract": "Although experimental evidence suggests calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) as a tumor-suppressor, the prognostic role of tumor CASR expression in colorectal carcinoma remains unclear. We hypothesized that higher tumor CASR expression might be associated with improved survival among colorectal cancer patients. We evaluated tumor expression levels of CASR by immunohistochemistry in 809 incident colorectal cancer patients within the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate multivariable hazard ratio (HR) for the association of tumor CASR expression with colorectal cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. We adjusted for potential confounders including tumor biomarkers such as microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation level, expressions of PTGS2, VDR and CTNNB1 and mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. There were 240 colorectal cancer-specific deaths and 427 all-cause deaths. The median follow-up of censored patients was 10.8 years (interquartile range: 7.2, 15.1). Compared with patients with no or weak expression of CASR, the multivariable HRs for colorectal cancer-specific mortality were 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55–1.16] in patients with moderate CASR expression and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32–0.79) in patients with intense CASR expression (p-trend = 0.003). The corresponding HRs for overall mortality were 0.85 (0.64–1.13) and 0.81 (0.58–1.12), respectively. Higher tumor CASR expression was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality. This finding needs further confirmation and if confirmed, may lead to better understanding of the role of CASR in colorectal cancer progression. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "CDK4/6 targeting is a promising therapeutic strategy under development for various tumor types. In this study, we used computational methods and The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset analysis to identify novel miRNAs that target CDK4/6 and exhibit potential for therapeutic development in colorectal cancer. The 30UTR of CDK4/6 mRNAs are targeted by a family of miRNAs, which includes miR-6883-5p, miR-149, miR-6785-5p, and miR-4728-5p. Ectopic expression of miR-6883-5p or miR-149 downregulated CDK4 and CDK6 levels in human colorectal cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the expression of CDK4/6 and miR-149 and intronic miRNA-6883-5p encoding the clock gene PER1 in colorectal cancer patient samples. Restoring expression of miR-6883-5p and miR-149 blocked cell growth leading to G0–G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. CDK4/6 targeting by miR-6883-5p and miR-149 could only partially explain the observed antiproliferative effects. Notably, both miRNAs synergized with the frontline colorectal cancer chemotherapy drug irinotecan. Further, they resensitized mutant p53-expressing cell lines resistant to 5-fluorouracil. Taken together, our results established the foundations of a candidate miRNA-based theranostic strategy to improve colorectal cancer management. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overall, cervical cancer survival in the United States has been reported to be among the highest in the world, despite slight decreases over the last decade. Objective of the current study was to describe cervical cancer survival trends among US women and examine differences by race and stage. METHODS: This study used data from the CONCORD-2 study to compare survival among women (aged 15-99 years) diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) with state- and race-specific life tables and was age-standardized with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Five-year survival was compared by race (all races, blacks, and whites). Two time periods, 2001-2003 and 2004-2009, were considered because of changes in how the staging variable was collected. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2009, 90,620 women were diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer. The proportion of cancers diagnosed at a regional or distant stage increased over time in most states. Overall, the 5-year survival was 63.5% in 2001-2003 and 62.8% in 2004-2009. The survival was lower for black women versus white women in both calendar periods and in most states; black women had a higher proportion of distant-stage cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The stability of the overall survival over time and the persistent differences in survival between white and black women in all US states suggest that there is a need for targeted interventions and improved access to screening, timely treatment, and follow-up care, especially among black women.

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: The impact of different neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) schedules and pathologic complete response (pCR) on the distribution of recurrence is unclear in esophageal cancer (EC). We assessed the effect of pCR and nCRT schedule in EC. Methods: Patients with T1N+/T2-4aN0-3/M0 EC treated in different centers, with either carboplatin/paclitaxel/41.4 Gy (CROSS: n = 134) or Cisplatin/5-fluorouracil/45-50.4 Gy (Cis/5FU: n = 88) followed by surgery were included. The effect of pCR on distribution and site-specific recurrence was determined for the CROSS group. After propensity score matching we compared the impact of both schedules (n = 63 each) on the recurrence pattern. Results: Overall (P = 0.005) and disease-free survival (P = 0.002) were significantly longer after pCR (n = 24). The pattern of recurrence differed between pCR and non-pCR group (P = 0.001) for locoregional (0 vs 7; 6.4%), distant (5; 20.8% vs 36; 32.7%), and combined local and distant (0 vs 21; 19.1%), respectively. After pCR, less local and distant recurrences were seen (P = 0.008). With equal median time to recurrence, the distribution of metastases only differed for lung metastases (P = 0.029), with 15 (23.8%) in the CROSS group versus 6 (9.5%) following Cis/5FU. Conclusions: Patients with pCR have less local and distant recurrence. The nCRT regime had a minor influence on the site-specific distribution of recurrence. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical trials in lung cancer increasingly require patients to provide fresh tumor tissue as a prerequisite to enrollment. The effects of this requirement on enrollment rates, enrollment durations, and patient selection have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed data generated by patients who consented to 1 or more interventional lung cancer clinical trials at the University of California-Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center between January 2013 and December 2014. Trials were considered to require a biopsy when enrollment was conditional on the procurement of tissue without intervening therapy between procurement and enrollment. RESULTS: In total, 311 patients underwent 368 screening incidents for 1 or more of 19 trials. Trials that required a new biopsy had a longer median screening duration (34 vs 14 days) than trials that did not require a biopsy (P <.001). Trials that required a biopsy had a greater screen failure rate (49.1% vs 26.5%; P <.001), which was largely driven by patients who did not undergo the required biopsy or lacked the required biomarker. Worsening performance status led to the majority of screen failures (56.5%) among biomarker-eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the scientific benefits of obtaining a new biopsy and requiring specific results for trial enrollment are clear, these requirements lead to a lengthening of the screening period, which, in some patients, is associated with clinical decline before enrollment. Implications for the interpretation of data from studies of this design should be explored. Cancer 2017;123:4800-7. © 2017 American Cancer Society. © 2017 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Most cancer forms known to be caused by viruses are increased among the immunosuppressed, but several cancer forms without established viral etiology are also increased, notably nonmelanoma skin carcinoma (NMSC). We followed all 13,429 solid organ transplantation patients in Sweden for cancer occurrence after transplantation. We requested these tumor specimens and sequenced the first 89 specimens received (62 NMSCs, 27 other cancers). The sequences were analyzed for viruses based on two bioinformatics algorithms (paracel-blast (sensitive for detection of known viruses) and hidden Markov model (HMM; sensitive for distantly related viruses)). Among the 62 NMSCs, the virus family detected in the largest proportion of specimens was Mimiviridae (9/62 NMSCs). The majority of the virus-related reads belonged to Papillomaviridae. The HMM analysis identified 86 additional previously not described viral contigs related to 11 virus families, with reads related to Mimiviridae being the most common (detected in 28/62 NMSCs) with the most prevalent contig (Mimivirus SE906, 1937 bp) detected in 17/62 NMSCs. Among the 27 other cancers, viral sequences were detected in only 5 specimens by blast analysis, compared to in all 27 specimens by HMM (Mimiviridae, Poxviridae, Phycodnaviridae and virus-related sequences yet unclassified to any family). 99% of the virus reads belonged to a single previously not described sequence (Mimivirus SE996, 911 bp). A multitude of viruses is readily detectable in specimens with cancers occurring among the immunosuppressed, with sequences related to Mimiviridae being the most prevalent. Further research would be needed to elucidate the biological significance of the viruses. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To prepare DANPs and PEG-DANPs and compare the effect of docetaxel commercial products (AisuⓇ), docetaxel-albumin nanoparticles (DANPs) and docetaxel-loaded PEG-albumin nanoparticles (PEG-DANPs) against the situ carcinoma model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in mice. Methods: We established the transplantation tumor model and the situ carcinoma model of NSCLC. When the tumor volume in transplantation tumor group reached about 120 mm3, the mice were treated 4 times at 7-day intervals with 5% glucose injection, AisuⓇ, DANPs or PEG-DANPs, respectively. 48 hours after the last treatment, the mice were sacrificed. The tumors with lung and the other major organs (including heart, liver, spleen, kidney) were removed and subjected to paraffin embedding for HE staining. Select another 32 of nude mice to establish the transplantation tumor model and treated them with the same drugs until to natural death, observe the survival rate and draw a rate curve. Results: The PEG-DANPs can effectively inhibit the growth of NSCLC transplanted tumor and situ carcinoma, it can suppress metastases more effectively and prolong the survival of the mice. Conclusion: PEG-DANPs has less side effect and its anti-tumor effect is more apparent, which has an extensive application psrospect. © 2017, Chinese Journal of New Drugs Co. Ltd.

    "Abstract": "Increasing parity and duration of combined oral contraceptive (COC) use provide substantial protection against ovarian carcinoma (cancer). There are limited data on the impact of the age of the births or age of COC use on reducing ovarian cancer risk. Here, we examined the effects of age at first and last births and age at use of COCs using data from studies conducted in Los Angeles County, California, USA (1,632 cases, 2,340 controls). After adjusting for the number of births, every 5 years that a first birth was delayed reduced the risk of ovarian cancer by 13% (95% CI 5–21%; p = 0.003); a first birth after age 35 was associated with a 47% lower risk than a first birth before age 25. COC use before age 35 was associated with greater protection per year of use than COC use at older ages. Considering previously published results as well as the results presented here, increasing parity and a later age at births are both important protective factors against ovarian cancer and the protection extends over 30 or more years from last birth. Current models of the etiology of ovarian cancer do not encompass an effect of late age at births. Our result of an attenuation of the protective effect with COC use after around age 35 needs further investigation as it has not been seen in all studies. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Primary HPV screening enables earlier diagnosis of cervical lesions compared to cytology, however, its effect on the risk of treatment and adverse obstetric outcomes has not been extensively investigated. We estimated the cumulative lifetime risk (CLR) of cervical cancer and excisional treatment, and change in adverse obstetric outcomes in HPV unvaccinated women and cohorts offered vaccination (>70% coverage in 12–13 years) for the Australian cervical screening program. Two-yearly cytology screening (ages 18–69 years) was compared to 5-yearly primary HPV screening with partial genotyping for HPV16/18 (ages 25–74 years). A dynamic model of HPV transmission, vaccination, cervical screening and treatment for precancerous lesions was coupled with an individual-based simulation of obstetric complications. For cytology screening, the CLR of cervical cancer diagnosis, death and treatment was estimated to be 0.649%, 0.198% and 13.4% without vaccination and 0.182%, 0.056% and 6.8%, in vaccinated women, respectively. For HPV screening, relative reductions of 33% and 22% in cancer risk for unvaccinated and vaccinated women are predicted, respectively, compared to cytology. Without the implementation of vaccination, a 4% increase in treatment risk for HPV versus cytology screening would have been expected, implying a possible increase in pre-term delivery (PTD) and low birth weight (LBW) events of 19 to 35 and 14 to 37, respectively, per 100,000 unvaccinated women. However, in vaccinated women, treatment risk will decrease by 13%, potentially leading to 4 to 41 fewer PTD events and from 2 more to 52 fewer LBW events per 100,000 vaccinated women. In unvaccinated women in cohorts offered vaccination as 12–13 year olds, no change to lifetime treatment risk is expected with HPV screening. In unvaccinated women in cohorts offered vaccination as 12–13 year olds, no change to lifetime treatment risk is expected with HPV screening. HPV screening starting at age 25 in populations with high vaccination coverage, is therefore expected to both improve the benefits (further decrease risk of cervical cancer) and reduce the harms (reduce treatments and possible obstetric complications) associated with cervical cancer screening. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the first CONCORD study, 5-year survival for patients with diagnosed with rectal cancer between 1990 and 1994 was <60%, with large racial disparities noted in the majority of participating states. We have updated these findings to 2009 by examining population-based survival by stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, race, and calendar period. METHODS: Data from the CONCORD-2 study were used to compare survival among individuals aged 15 to 99 years who were diagnosed in 37 states encompassing up to 80% of the US population. We estimated net survival up to 5 years after diagnosis correcting for background mortality with state-specific and race-specific life table. Survival estimates were age-standardized with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. We present survival estimates by race (all, black, and white) for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting the data for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Summary Stage 2000. RESULTS: There was a small increase in 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year net survival between 2001-2003 (84.6%, 70.7%, and 63.2%, respectively), and 2004-2009 (85.1%, 71.5%, and 64.1%, respectively). Black individuals were found to have lower 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival than white individuals in both periods; the absolute difference in survival between black and white individuals declined only for 5-year survival. Black patients had lower 5-year survival than whites at each stage at the time of diagnosis in both time periods. CONCLUSIONS: There was little improvement noted in net survival for patients with rectal cancer, with persistent disparities noted between black and white individuals. Additional investigation is needed to identify and implement effective interventions to ensure the consistent and equitable use of high-quality screening, diagnosis, and treatment to improve survival for patients with rectal cancer.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conservative management of aggressive prostate cancer in the elderly without definitive therapy has been associated with a 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality of approximately 50%. The authors examined the prevalence of definitive therapy in elderly patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease. METHODS: 411,343 patients who were diagnosed from 2004 through 2012 with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer were identified in the National Cancer Database. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidity was used to examine the association between age and receipt of definitive therapy, defined as radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, and of primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) among patients who did not receive definitive therapy. RESULTS: In total, 87.1% of high-risk patients and 91.9% of intermediate-risk patients received definitive therapy. When stratified by age, 93.7%, 92.1%, 90.8%, 87.6%, 80.9%, and 55.2% of high-risk patients and 96.1%, 94.7%, 93.4%, 89.7%, 82.7%, and 62.8% of intermediate-risk patients ages <60, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, and ≥80 years received definitive therapy, respectively. For both high-risk and intermediate-risk patients, increasing age was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving definitive therapy overall (both P <.001) and a greater likelihood of receiving primary ADT among those who did not receive definitive therapy (both P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Older age was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving definitive therapy and an increased likelihood of receiving primary ADT in this national cohort of patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer. Notably, approximately 40% to 45% of patients aged ≥80 years did not receive definitive therapy. These findings are alarming given the dismal outcomes of conservatively managed unfavorable-risk prostate cancer.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with breast cancer work for pay at the time of their diagnosis, and the treatment plan may threaten their livelihood. Understanding work experiences in a contemporary population-based sample is necessary to inform initiatives to reduce the burden of cancer care. METHODS: Women who were 20 to 79 years old and had been diagnosed with stage 0 to II breast cancer, as reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in 2014-2015, were surveyed. Of the 3672 eligible women, 2502 responded (68%); 1006 who reported working before their diagnosis were analyzed. Multivariate models evaluated correlates of missing work for >1 month and stopping work altogether versus missing work for ≤1 month. RESULTS: In this diverse sample, most patients (62%) underwent lumpectomy; 16% underwent unilateral mastectomy (8% with reconstruction); and 23% underwent bilateral mastectomy (19% with reconstruction). One-third (33%) received chemotherapy. Most (84%) worked full-time before their diagnosis; however, only 50% had paid sick leave, 39% had disability benefits, and 38% had flexible work schedules. Surgical treatment was strongly correlated with missing >1 month of work (odds ratio [OR] for bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction vs lumpectomy, 7.8) and with stopping work altogether (OR for bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction vs lumpectomy, 3.1). Chemotherapy receipt (OR for missing >1 month, 1.3; OR for stopping work altogether, 3.9) and race (OR for missing >1 month for blacks vs whites, 2.0; OR for stopping work altogether for blacks vs whites, 1.7) also correlated. Those with paid sick leave were less likely to stop working (OR, 0.5), as were those with flexible schedules (OR, 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Working patients who received more aggressive treatments were more likely to experience substantial employment disruptions.

    "Abstract": "The prevalence of fusions of the transmembrane protease, serine 2, gene (TMPRSS2) with the erythroblast transformation-specific-related gene (ERG), or TMPRSS2:ERG, in prostate cancer varies by race. However, such somatic aberration and its association with prognostic factors have neither been studied in aWest African population nor been systematically reviewed in the context of racial differences. We used immunohistochemistry to assess oncoprotein encoded by the ERG gene as the established surrogate of ERG fusion genes among 262 prostate cancer biopsies from the Ghana Prostate Study (2004-2006). Poisson regression with robust variance estimation provided prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ERG expression in relation to patient characteristics. We found that 47 of 262 (18%) prostate cancers were ERG-positive, and being negative for ERG staining was associated with higher Gleason score. We further conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions in relation to race, Gleason score, and tumor stage, combining results from Ghana with 40 additional studies. Meta-analysis showed the prevalence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions in prostate cancer to be highest in men of European descent (49%), followed by men of Asian (27%) and then African (25%) descent. The lower prevalence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions in men of African descent implies that alternative genomic mechanisms might explain the disproportionately high prostate cancer burden in such populations. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "The current study aims to provide stronger evidence to aid in our understanding of the role of cumulative occupational exposure to (softwood-dominated) mixed wood dust in aetiology of nasal cancer. We included broad exposure occurred in a range of wood-processing occupation across varied industries in four Nordic countries. A population-based case-control study was conducted on all male cases with nasal adenocarcinoma (393 cases), other types of nasal cancer (2,446) and nasopharyngeal cancer (1,747) diagnosed in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland between 1961 and 2005. For each case, five male controls, who were alive at the time of diagnosis of the case (index date), were randomly selected, matched by birth-year and country. Cumulative exposures (CE)s to wood dust and formaldehyde before the index date were quantified based on a job-exposure matrix linked to occupational titles derived from population censuses. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the CE of wood dust were estimated by conditional logistic regression, adjusted for CE to formaldehyde and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. There was an increasing risk of nasal adenocarcinoma related to wood dust exposure. The HR in the highest CE category of wood dust (≥ 28.82 mg/m3-years) was 16.5 (95% CI 5.05–54.1). Neither nonadenocarcinoma of the nose nor nasopharyngeal cancer could be linked to wood dust exposure. CE to softwood-dominated mixed wood dusts is strongly linked with elevated risk in nasal adenocarcinoma but not with other types of nasal or nasopharyngeal cancer. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Although Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is one of the main causes of cancer death, very little improvement has been made in the last decades regarding diagnosis and outcomes. In this study, a bimodal fluorescence/129Xe NMR probe containing a xenon host, a fluorescent moiety and a therapeutic antibody has been designed to target the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors (EGFR) overexpressed in cancer cells. This biosensor shows high selectivity for the EGFR, and a biological activity similar to that of the antibody. It is detected with high specificity and high sensitivity (sub-nanomolar range) through hyperpolarized 129Xe NMR. This promising system should find important applications for theranostic use. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast angiosarcoma (AS) accounts for less than 1% of all breast cancers. The goal of this study was to determine patient outcomes in radiation-associated angiosarcoma of the breast (RAAS) and sporadic AS. We evaluated patterns of recurrence and predictors of breast AS survival. Methods: Patients with pathologically confirmed AS from 1994 to 2014 referred to Mount Sinai Hospital/Princess Margaret Cancer Centre were included. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS), clinicopathologic characteristics, patterns of recurrence and factors predictive of survival. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used for OS and DFS. Results: Twenty-six patients were included: 6 with sporadic AS and 20 with RAAS. Median follow-up was 24 months. Five-year OS for RAAS and sporadic subgroups were 44% and 40%, respectively (P = ns). Five-year DFS for RAAS and sporadic subgroups were 23% and 20%, respectively (P = ns). Overall recurrence rate was 67% with median time to recurrence of 11 months. Age, tumor depth, margin status, and tumor size were not statistically significant predictive factors for OS and DFS. Discussion: Breast AS is associated with poor survival and high recurrence rates. Prognosis may be mainly determined by its aggressive biology. Referral to tertiary care centers for multimodality treatment is recommended. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer risk has been insufficiently investigated in East Asian populations, who frequently have the inactive enzyme for metabolizing acetaldehyde. Given that acetaldehyde associated with alcohol consumption is assessed as a carcinogen, consideration of differences in acetaldehyde exposure would aid accuracy in assessing the bladder cancer risk associated with alcohol consumption. Here, we conducted a population-based cohort study in Japan to examine this association, including information on the flushing response as a surrogate marker of the capacity of acetaldehyde metabolism. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. During follow up from 1990 through 2012 for the 95,915 subjects (45,649 men and 50,266 women, aged 40–69 years), 354 men and 110 women were newly diagnosed with bladder cancer. No significant association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer risk was observed in the overall analysis. Among male flushers, HRs were 1.04 (95% CI 0.70–1.54), 1.67 (1.16–2.42), 1.02 (0.62–1.67) and 0.63 (0.33–1.20) for alcohol consumption of 1–150, 151–300, 301–450, >450 g/week of pure ethanol compared with non-drinkers and occasional drinkers, respectively, indicating an inverted U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer risk. In contrast, no significant association was identified among male non-flushers. The marginally significant interaction between alcohol consumption and the flushing response (p for interaction = 0.083) may support our hypothesis that acetaldehyde derived from alcohol consumption is associated with bladder cancer risk. A prospective study considering polymorphisms of genes involved in acetaldehyde metabolism is warranted. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the western world. An effective screening program leading to early detection of disease would severely reduce the mortality of CRC. Alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to CRC, but the potential of microbial markers for use in CRC screening has been largely unstudied. We used a nested case–control study of 238 study subjects to explore the use of microbial markers for clbA+ bacteria harboring the pks pathogenicity island, afa-C+ diffusely adherent Escherichia coli harboring the afa-1 operon, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in stool as potential screening markers for CRC. We found that individual markers for clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum were more abundant in stool of patients with CRC, and could predict cancer with a relatively high specificity (81.5% and 76.9%, respectively) and with a sensitivity of 56.4% and 69.2%, respectively. In a combined test of clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum, CRC was detected with a specificity of 63.1% and a sensitivity of 84.6%. Our findings support a potential value of microbial factors in stool as putative noninvasive biomarkers for CRC detection. We propose that microbial markers may represent an important future screening strategy for CRC, selecting patients with a “high-risk” microbial pattern to other further diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy. © 2017 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of UICC",

    "Abstract": "Phenyl butyrate (PB) has been proved to decrease pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation level and increase PDH activity by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) in fibroblast cells, PDH deficiency zebrafish and wild type mice. PB has also shown efficacy in many cancers and so far, all of its anti-tumor activity has been attributed to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. As PDK1/PDH controls the critical switch between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in cancer cells, PDK1 is a key target in tumor metabolism for anti-cancer treatment. We hypothesize that the therapeutic effects of PB in cancers might also depend on suppressing PDK1 and promoting PDH activity, in addition to its proposed role as HDAC inhibitor. We showed that PB directly inhibited the kinase activity of PDK1 and increased the activity of PDH in an enzyme assay. In several different cancer cell lines, PB reduced the phosphorylation level of PDH, increased the mitochondrial respiration, decreased glycolysis in cytoplasm, reversed mitochondrial hyperpolarization, activated several proteins in apoptotic signaling pathway and then induced the apoptosis of cells. In summary, this is the first study indicated that PB could exert its anti-cancer effects through inhibiting PDK1, altering the mitochondrial bioenergetics and inducing apoptosis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Prior to the “no ink on tumor” SSO/ASTRO consensus guideline, approximately 20% of women with stage I/II breast cancers undergoing breast conservation surgery at our institution underwent margin re-excision. On May 20, 2013, our institution changed the definition of negative margins from 2 mm to “no ink on tumor.”. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who had surgery at our institution with clinical stage I/II breast cancers between June 1, 2011 and May 1, 2015. In the pre-guideline cohort (pre) and post-guideline cohort (post), negative margins were 2 mm and “no ink on tumor,” respectively. Results: Implementation of the guideline resulted in a significant decrease in the positive/close margin rate (29.6% pre vs 10.1% post; P < 0.001) and numerical decrease in re-excision rate (20.4% pre vs 16.3% post; P = 0.104). No significant difference was found in local recurrence between the cohorts with limited follow-up (1.2% pre vs 1.5% post; P = 0.787). Conclusion: The implementation of the “no ink on tumor” guideline at our institution has resulted in a significant decrease in positive margin rates and a numerical decrease in margin re-excisions. In addition to margin status, surgeons continue to use individual patient and histologic factors to decide for or against margin re-excision. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "AIM: Breast cancer in New Zealand-based Pasifika women is a significant issue. Although Pasifika women have a lower incidence of breast cancer compared to New Zealand European women, they have higher breast cancer mortality and lower five-year survival. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and tumour biology of Pasifika women and to compare New Zealand European women to identify what factors impact on early (Stage 1 and 2) vs advanced stage (Stage 3 and 4) at diagnosis. METHOD: Data on all Pasifika and New Zealand European women diagnosed with breast cancer (C50) during the period 1 June 2000 to 31 May 2013 was extracted from the Auckland and Waikato Breast Cancer Registries. Descriptive tables and Chi-square test were used to examine di erences in characteristics and tumour biology between Pasifika and New Zealand European women. Logistic regression was used to identify factors that contributed to an increased risk of advanced stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: A significantly higher proportion of Pasifika women had advanced disease at diagnosis compared to New Zealand European women (33.3% and 18.3%, respectively). Cancer biology in Pasifika women was more likely to be: 1) HER2+, 2) ER/PR negative and 3) have a tumour size of ≥50mm. Pasifika women live in higher deprivation areas of 9–10 compared to New Zealand European women (55% vs 14%, respectively) and were less likely to have their cancer identified through screening. Logistic regression showed that if Pasifika women were on the screen-detected pathway they had similar odds (not sig.) of having advanced disease at diagnosis to New Zealand European women. CONCLUSION: Mode of detection, deprivation, age and some biological factors contributed to the di erence in odds ratio between Pasifika and New Zealand European women. For those of screening age, adherence to the screening programme and improvements in access to earlier diagnosis for Pasifika women under the current screening age have the potential to make a substantial di erence in the number of Pasifika women presenting with late-stage disease. © NZMA.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prostate cancer (PC) is an important medical and socio-economical problem due to its increasing incidence. The development of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, and a continuing decrease in the rates of other common neoplasms, such as lung and stomach since mid-1980s, prostate cancer has become one of the most common cancers among men. Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer in men, preceded only by lung cancer, and its early diagnosis is crucial for a successful treatment, that will prolong survival and improve quality of life. The main objective of our study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in detecting prostatic pathologies and staging of prostate cancer by correlating these methods with histopathological results. Material/Methods: The study is a cross-sectional diagnostic study performed in 66 patients with a high degree of clinical suspicion of prostatic pathology. All patients underwent TRUS, T1W, T2W, DWI, and 3D PRESSMRS sequences, and we also calculated ADC values and Cho Cr/Cit MRS ratios for all patients. Results: Combination of MRI and MRS showed the highest diagnostic accuracy among the imaging modalities in detecting of prostatic neoplasm, followed by MRI, and then by TRUS. MRS plays a complementary role to MRI, by increasing its diagnostic accuracy. Due to a high cost, limited availability and increased scanning time, combination of MRI and MRS is currently not recommended as a first line investigation for detecting prostate neoplasms, hence USG (TRUS) remains the first line investigation due to its low cost, easy availability, time effectiveness and comparable efficacy. Conclusions: MRI MRS has more diagnostic accuracy than MRI alone for detection of prostate pathologies. MRS, plays significant complementary role and should be included in the routine MR imaging protocols. MRI helps in diagnosis, localization, better tissue characterization and staging of prostate cancer. TRUS is easily available, cost effective and has comparable efficacy. © Pol J Radiol, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The 5-year relative survival for prostate cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 1994 in the United States was very high (92%); however, survival in black males was 7% lower compared with white males. The authors updated these findings and examined survival by stage and race. METHODS: The authors used data from the CONCORD-2 study for males (ages 15-99 years) who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 37 states, covering 80% of the US population. Survival was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables and was age-standardized. Data were presented for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting SEER Summary Stage 2000. RESULTS: Among the 1,527,602 prostate cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, the proportion of localized cases increased from 73% to 77% in black males and from 77% to 79% in white males. Although the proportion of distant-stage cases was higher among black males than among white males, they represented less than 6% of cases in both groups between 2004 and 2009. Net survival exceeded 99% for localized stage between 2004 and 2009 in both racial groups. Overall, and in most states, 5-year net survival exceeded 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer survival has increased since the first CONCORD study, and the racial gap has narrowed. Earlier detection of localized cancers likely contributed to this finding. However, racial disparities also were observed in overall survival. To help understand which factors might contribute to the persistence of this disparity, states could use local data to explore sociodemographic characteristics, such as survivors’ health insurance status, health literacy, treatment decision-making processes, and treatment preferences.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: DNA topoisomerase inhibitors are commonly used for treating small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP1) repairs DNA damage caused by this class of drugs and may therefore influence treatment outcome. In this study, we investigated whether common TDP1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are associated with overall survival among SCLC patients. Experimental Design: Two TDP1 SNPs (rs942190 and rs2401863) were analyzed in 890 patients from 10 studies in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO). The Kaplan- Meier method and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate genotype associations with overall mortality at 36 months postdiagnosis, adjusting for age, sex, race, and tumor stage. Results: Patients homozygous for the minor allele (GG) of rs942190 had poorer survival compared with those carrying AA alleles, with a HR of 1.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08- 1.72, P= 0.01), but no association with survival was observed for patients carrying the AG genotype (HR = 1.04, 95% CI, 0.84- 1.29, P = 0.72). For rs2401863, patients homozygous for the minor allele (CC) tended to have better survival than patients carrying AA alleles (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02, P = 0.07). Results from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), and the ePOSSUM web application support the potential function of rs942190. Conclusions: We found the rs942190 GG genotype to be associated with relatively poor survival among SCLC patients. Further investigation is needed to confirm the result and to determine whether this genotype may be a predictive marker for treatment efficacy of DNA topoisomerase inhibitors. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although hospitalized patients with advanced cancer have a low chance of surviving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the processes by which they change their code status from full code to do not resuscitate (DNR) are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study on a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with advanced cancer. Two physicians used a consensus-driven medical record review to characterize processes that led to code status order transitions from full code to DNR. RESULTS: In total, 1047 hospitalizations were reviewed among 728 patients. Admitting clinicians did not address code status in 53% of hospitalizations, resulting in code status orders of “presumed full.” In total, 275 patients (26.3%) transitioned from full code to DNR, and 48.7% (134 of 275 patients) of those had an order of “presumed full” at admission; however, upon further clarification, the patients expressed that they had wished to be DNR before the hospitalization. We identified 3 additional processes leading to order transition from full code to DNR acute clinical deterioration (15.3%), discontinuation of cancer-directed therapy (17.1%), and education about the potential harms/futility of CPR (15.3%). Compared with discontinuing therapy and education, transitions because of acute clinical deterioration were associated with less patient involvement (P =.002), a shorter time to death (P <.001), and a greater likelihood of inpatient death (P =.005). CONCLUSIONS: One-half of code status order changes among hospitalized patients with advanced cancer were because of full code orders in patients who had a preference for DNR before hospitalization. Transitions due of acute clinical deterioration were associated with less patient engagement and a higher likelihood of inpatient death.

    "Abstract": "Protein N-myristoylation enables localization to membranes and helps maintain protein conformation and function. N-myristoyltransferases (NMT) catalyze co- or posttranslational myristoylation of Src family kinases and other oncogenic proteins, thereby regulating their function. In this study, we provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that inhibiting the N-myristoyltransferase NMT1 suppresses cell-cycle progression, proliferation, and malignant growth of prostate cancer cells. Loss of myristoylation abolished the tumorigenic potential of Src and its synergy with androgen receptor in mediating tumor invasion. We identified the myristoyl-CoA analogue B13 as a small-molecule inhibitor of NMT1 enzymatic activity. B13 exposure blocked Src myristoylation and Src localization to the cytoplasmic membrane, attenuating Src-mediated oncogenic signaling. B13 exerted its anti-invasive and antitumor effects against prostate cancer cells, with minimal toxic side-effects in vivo. Structural optimization based on structure–activity relationships enabled the chemical synthesis of LCL204, with enhanced inhibitory potency against NMT1. Collectively, our results offer a preclinical proof of concept for the use of protein myristoylation inhibitors as a strategy to block prostate cancer progression. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the aggregation of common metabolic conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and dyslipidemia) is a risk factor for breast cancer. Breast cancer incidence has risen steadily in Asian American women, and whether these metabolic conditions contribute to breast cancer risk in certain Asian American subgroups is unknown. We investigated the role of physician-diagnosed hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes separately, and in combination, in relation to the risk of breast cancer in a population-based case–control study of 2,167 Asian Americans diagnosed with breast cancer and 2,035 age and ethnicity matched control women in Los Angeles County. Compared to Asian American women who did not have any of the metabolic conditions, those with 1, 2 or 3 conditions showed a steady increase in risk (respective odds ratios were 1.12, 1.42 and 1.62; P trend = 0.001) with adjustment for covariates including body mass index. Similar significant trends were observed in Filipina Americans (P trend = 0.021), postmenopausal women (P trend =0.001), Asian women who were born in the United States (US) (P trend = 0.052) and migrants who have lived in the US for at least 20 years (P trend = 0.004), but not migrants who lived in the US for <20 years (P trend = 0.64). These results suggest that westernization in lifestyle (diet and physical inactivity) and corresponding increase in adiposity have contributed to the rising prevalence of these metabolic conditions, which in turn, are associated with an increase in breast cancer. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previous studies have suggested that DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is an important protective pathway after damage. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene plays an important role in the DNA DSB repair pathway. DNA damage is a major cytotoxic effect that can be caused by radiation, and the ability to repair DNA after damage varies among different tissues. Impaired DNA repair pathways are associated with high sensitivity to radiation exposure. Hence, ATM gene polymorphisms are thought to influence the risk of cancer and radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) risk in cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. However, the results of previous studies are inconsistent. We therefore conducted this comprehensive meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) and Wanfang databases to identify studies that investigated the association between the ATM gene polymorphisms and both lung cancer and RP radiotherapy-treated lung cancer (the last search was conducted on Dec.10, 2015). The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to investigate the strength of these relationships. Funnel plots and Begg's and Egger's tests were conducted to assess the publication bias. All analyses were performed in STATA 13.0 software. Results: Ten eligible case-control studies (4731 cases and 5142 controls) on lung cancer susceptibility and four (192 cases and 772 controls) on RP risk were included. The results of the overall and subgroup analyses indicated that in the ATM gene, the rs189037 (-111G>A, -4519G>A), rs664677 (44831C>T, 49238C>T) and rs664143 (131,717T>G) polymorphisms were significantly associated with lung cancer susceptibility (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.04-1.39, P=0.01; OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.06-1.49, P=0.01; OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.15-1.78, P<0.01). Additionally, the rs189037 variant was significantly associated with RP risk (OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.02-2.97, P=0.04). No publication bias was found in the funnel plots, Begg's tests or Egger's tests. Conclusions: The results indicate that the ATM rs189037, rs664677 and rs664143 gene polymorphisms are risk factors for lung cancer, while the ATM rs189037 variant was significantly associated with RP risk. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway play crucial roles in the homeostasis of pancreatic cancer cells. This study combined for the first time the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib (Gan) and the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (Carf) to target key mechanisms of homeostasis in pancreatic cancer. It was hypothesized that Gan plus Carf would elicit potent antitumor activity by modulating complementary homeostatic processes. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo effects of this combination on mechanisms of cell growth and viability were evaluated with human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2 and HPAC). RESULTS: Combined treatment with Gan and Carf significantly decreased cell viability. The mechanism varied by cell line and involved G2-M cell-cycle arrest accompanied by a consistent reduction in key cell-cycle regulatory proteins and concomitant upregulation of p27. Further studies revealed increased autophagy markers, including the upregulation of autophagy related 7 and light chain 3 cleavage, and evidence of apoptosis (increased Bax expression and processing of caspase 3). Immunoblot analyses confirmed the modulation of other pathways that influence cell viability, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and nuclear factor κB. Finally, the treatment of athymic mice bearing HPAC tumors with Gan and Carf significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. An immunoblot analysis of freshly isolated tumors from animals at the end of the study confirmed in vivo modulation of key signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal Gan plus Carf to be a promising combination with synergistic antiproliferative, apoptotic, and pro-autophagy effects in preclinical studies of pancreatic cancer and will further the exploration of the utility of this treatment combination in clinical trials.

    "Abstract": "Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of esophageal cancer have not been thoroughly characterized with quantitative health-disparity measures. Using data from1992-2013 from 13 US cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we assessed such disparities according to histological type, based on a variety of disparity metrics. The age-standardized incidence rate of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was highest among black persons, while adenocarcinoma mainly affected white men. The rate of SCC decreased over time in all racial/ethnic groups, and this was most pronounced in black persons (by 5.7%per year among men and 5.0%among women). The adenocarcinoma rate rose among non-Hispanic whites and among black men. Racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of total esophageal cancer decreased over time, which was duemainly to reduced disparities in SCC. The 2 absolute disparity measures - range difference and between-group variance - for adenocarcinoma rose by 3.2%and 6.8% per year, respectively, in men and by 1.8%and 5.3% per year, respectively, in women. This study demonstrates decreased racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of esophageal SCC over time in the United States, while disparities increased in adenocarcinoma incidence asmeasured on the absolute scale. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Aims: We investigated the prognostic value of tumor length measurements acquired both from pre-operative imaging and post-operative pathology in esophageal cancer. Methods: Tumor lengths were examined retrospectively for 389 esophagectomy patients with respect to Endoscopy, EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound), CT and PET-CT, and pathology. Correlations between the measurements on the different approaches were assessed, and associations between tumor length and survival were analyzed. Results: Only the tumor lengths assessed on pathology were found to be significantly associated with overall (P = 0.001) and recurrence free (P < 0.001) survival on univariable analysis. The median overall survival was 47.1 months in those patients with tumor lengths <3.0 cm, falling to 19.6 and 18.0 months in those with 3.0-4.4 and 4.5+ cm tumors, respectively, demonstrating a reduction in patient survival at a tumor length of around 3 cm. Tumor length on pathology was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation and both T- and N-categories. After accounting for these factors, tumor length on pathology was a significant independent predictor of recurrence-free (P = 0.016), but not overall (P = 0.128) survival. Conclusions: Tumor lengths on pathology were found to be the most predictive of patient outcome. However, after accounting for other tumor-related factors, tumor length only resulted in a marginal improvement in predictive accuracy. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: We aimed to assess change in HER2 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with primary breast cancer and the prognostic impact of such changes. Patients and Methods: The study comprised 588 patients with a non-pathologic complete response who received anthracycline and/or taxane-based regimens in NAC setting. HER2 status was assessed before NAC and in residual invasive tumor of the surgical specimens. The associations between the change in HER2 status and clinicopathological factors were assessed. Results: Before NAC, 489 (83%) of the 588 patients had HER2-negative tumors and 99 patients (17%) had HER2-positive tumors. Eleven (2.2%) of the HER2-negative tumors changed to HER2-positive, while 33 (33%) of the HER2-positive tumors changed to HER2-negative. ER and PR-positivity before NAC were associated with loss of HER2-positivity, whereas receiving trastuzumab was not. In terms of disease-free survival, there was no difference between patients with and those without change in HER2 status after NAC in either the patients with HER2-negative tumors (P = 0.26) or with HER2-positive tumors before NAC (P = 0.23). Conclusion: Our results showed that changes in HER2 status did not affect patients’ prognosis. Further studies are needed to determine whether HER2-targeting agents can be omitted when loss of HER2-positivity is confirmed after NAC. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background Patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM) have been excluded from trials evaluating immunotherapy in melanoma. As such, immunotherapy's role in MBM is poorly understood, particularly in combination with radiotherapy. Methods The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with MBM receiving brain radiotherapy. They were classified according to immunotherapy receipt. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify factors associated with survival. Results Among 1287 patients, 185 received immunotherapy. Factors associated with improved survival included younger age, academic facility, lower extracranial disease burden, stereotactic radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Conclusions Adding immunotherapy to radiotherapy for MBM is associated with improved survival. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Serum and plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) has been shown as an informative, non-invasive source of biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and prediction of treatment resistance. Starting from the hypothesis that androgen receptor (AR) gene copy number (CN) gain is a frequent event in metastatic castration resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC), we propose to analyze this event in cfDNA as a potential predictive biomarker. We evaluated AR CN in cfDNA using 2 different real-time PCR assays and 2 reference genes (RNaseP and AGO1). DNA amount of 60 ng was used for each assay combination. AR CN gain was confirmed using Digital PCR as a more accurate method. CN variation analysis has already been demonstrated to be informative for the prediction of treatment resistance in the setting of mCRPC, but it could be useful also for other purposes in different patient settings. CN analysis on cfDNA has several advantages: it is non-invasive, rapid and easy to perform, and it starts from a small volume of serum or plasma material. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

    "Abstract": "Comparing risk factor associations between invasive breast cancers and possible precursorsmay further our understanding of factors related to initiation versus progression. Accordingly, among 190,325 postmenopausal participants in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study (1995-2011), we compared the association between risk factors and incident ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; n = 1,453) with that of risk factors and invasive ductal carcinomas (n = 7,525); in addition, we compared the association between risk factors and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS; n = 186) with that of risk factors and invasive lobular carcinomas (n = 1,191). Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. We used case-only multivariable logistic regression to test for heterogeneity in associations. Younger age at menopause was associated with a higher risk of DCIS but lower risks of LCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas (P for heterogeneity < 0.01). Prior breast biopsy was more strongly associated with the risk of LCIS than the risk of DCIS (P for heterogeneity = 0.04). Increased risks associated with use of menopausal hormone therapy were stronger for LCIS than DCIS (P for heterogeneity = 0.03) and invasive lobular carcinomas (P for heterogeneity < 0.01). Associations were similar for race, age at menarche, age at first birth, family history, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, which suggests thatmost risk factor associations are similar for in situ and invasive cancers and may influence early stages of tumorigenesis. The differential associations observed for various factors may provide important clues for understanding the etiology of certain breast cancers. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "AIM: The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the overall survival of women with advanced stage (Stage IIIA-IV) high-grade serous ovarian cancer in Macedonia MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional medical record review of patients diagnosed with advanced stage HGSC. Patients were deemed eligible for inclusion if they were diagnosed with an advanced stage (Stage IIIA-IV) HGSC of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum between 2009 and 2015. The data were analyzed in a descriptive fashion and summary statistics were provided, as appropriate. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 81 eligible patients were identified and included in the study. The average overall survival in the studied cohort was 46.59 months (95%CI = 39.11-54.06). Patients that were optimally debulked and patients that had a platinum-free interval larger than 12 months had significantly longer survival in the current series (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: the average overall survival of advanced stage HGSC patients in the studied series was 46.59 months (95%CI = 39.11-54.06). Patients aged 65 years or younger tended to live approximately ten months longer than patients older than 65 years, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference in HGSC survival in the groups of patients with grade 2 and grade 3 disease. However, optimal surgical debulking and platinum sensitivity were associated with significantly better overall survival. © 2017 Igor Aluloski, Mile Tanturovski, Rubens Jovanovic, Slavica Kostadinova-Kunovska, Gordana Petrusevska, Igor Stojkovski, Bojana Petreska.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) are rare yet lethal malignancies with limited treatment options. Many malignant tumors, including papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and ATC, are associated with increased expression of ICAM-1, providing a rationale for utilizing ICAM-1-targeting agents for the treatment of aggressive cancer. We developed a third-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting ICAM-1 to leverage adoptive T-cell therapy as a new treatment modality. Experimental Design: ICAM-1 CAR T cells were applied to multiple malignant and nonmalignant target cells to investigate specific target cell death and \"off-tumor\" toxicity in vitro. In vivo therapeutic efficacy of ICAM-1 CAR T cells was examined in ATC mouse models established from a cell line and patient-derived tumors that rapidly develop systemic metastases. Results: ICAM-1 CAR T cells demonstrated robust and specific killing of PTC and ATC cell lines in vitro. Interestingly, although certain ATC cell lines showed heterogeneous levels of ICAM-1 expression, addition of cytotoxic CAR T cells induced increased ICAM-1 expression such that all cell lines became targetable. In mice with systemic ATC, a single administration of ICAM-1 CAR T cells mediated profound tumor killing that resulted in long-term remission and significantly improved survival. Patient-derived ATC cells overexpressed ICAM-1 and were largely eliminated by autologous ICAM-1 CAR T cells in vitro and in animal models. Conclusions: Our findings are the first demonstration of CAR T therapy against both a metastatic, thyroid cancer cell line and advanced ATC patient-derived tumors that exhibit dramatic therapeutic efficacy and survival benefit in animal studies. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Study Design. A retrospective, single-center study. Objective. Investigation of the changes in the treatment outcomes of patients with lung cancer derived metastatic spine tumors. Summary of Background Data. Metastatic spine tumors derived from lung cancer had been progressive, and their prognosis is poor. It has recently been reported that the use of molecularly targeted drugs and bone-modifying agents (BMAs) improved the treatment outcomes of patients with lung cancer, but no detailed information about the treatment of metastatic spine tumors has been reported. Methods. Two hundred seven patients with lung cancer derived metastatic spine tumors who were examined after 2000 were analyzed. They were divided into 54 patients who were treated in or before 2005 (surgical treatment: 25 patients, conservative treatment: 29 patients) (group B) and 153 patients who were treated from 2006 onwards, when a molecularly targeted drug and BMA were introduced (surgical treatment: 24, conservative treatment: 129) (group A), and the treatment outcomes of the two groups were compared. Results. Significant differences in age and the affected vertebral level, paralysis grade, and Tokuhashi score (general condition, the number of vertebral metastases, and the total score) were detected between the groups. Regarding treatment outcomes, the mean duration of the post-treatment survival period was 5.1 and 9.3 months in groups B and A, respectively, that is, it was significantly longer in group A (P<0.05). No significant intergroup difference in pain improvement was noted, and no significant post-treatment improvement in paralysis was achieved in either group. The post-treatment discharge-to-home eligibility rate did not differ significantly between the groups, but the Barthel Index improved significantly after treatment in group A (P<0.05). Conclusion. After molecularly targeted drugs and BMA were introduced as treatments for lung cancer derived metastatic spine tumors, the survival periods of patients with such tumors increased, and their activity of daily living after treatment improved. © Copyright 2017 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Therefore, more sensitive and early diagnostic methods for CRC are urgently needed. In this study, an efficient electrochemical biosensor for early diagnosis of adenoma-to-carcinoma progression that employs a series of chemically modified affinity peptides was developed. A series of amino acid-substituted and cysteine-incorporated synthetic peptides with flexible linkers was chemically synthesized and immobilized to a gold sensor layer; performance of the sensor was monitored using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Potential affinity peptides (LRG1 BP1–BP4) specific for the LRG1 biomarker as a target protein were chosen according to a quantitative current decrease and dynamic impedance increase by CV and EIS, respectively. Using EIS, the Kd value of the LRG1 BP3 peptide was found to be 8.3 ± 2.7 nM. The applicability of the sensor to detect LRG1 proteins was confirmed in human plasma from colorectal adenomas and carcinomas (n = 20 in each group). The detection of LRG1 in accordance with the ΔRct value (electron-transfer resistance at the electrode surface) of the sensor layer incorporating LRG1 BP3 peptides showed a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) between adenomas and carcinomas, indicating that the potential use of this biosensing platform for detecting the CRC biomarker, as well as for monitoring the colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma transition in an electrochemically miniaturized biosensor (e-chem biosensor) in point-of-care testing, is possible. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been reported to stimulate myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in multiple cancers, but the molecular events involved in this process are not completely understood. We previously found that cancer-derived IL-6 induces T cell suppression of MDSCs in vitro via the activation of STAT3/IDO signaling pathway. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We found that in primary breast cancer tissues, cancer-derived IL-6 was positively correlated with infiltration of MDSCs in situ, which was accompanied by more aggressive tumor phenotypes and worse clinical outcomes. In vitro IL-6 stimulated the amplification of MDSCs and promoted their T cell suppression ability, which were fully inhibited by an IL-6-specific blocking antibody. Our results demonstrate that IL-6-dependent suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) suppression in MDSCs induced phosphorylation of the JAK1, JAK2, TYK2, STAT1, and STAT3 proteins, which was correlated with T cell suppression of MDSCs in vitro. Therefore, dysfunction in the SOCS feedback loop promoted long-term activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and predominantly contributed to IL-6-mediated effects on MDSCs. Furthermore, IL-6-induced inhibition of SOCS3 and activation of the JAK/STAT pathway was correlated with an elevated expression of IL-6 receptor a (CD126), in which the soluble CD126-mediated IL-6 trans-signaling pathway significantly regulated IL-6-mediated effects on MDSCs. Finally, IL-6-induced SOCS3 dysfunction and sustained activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway promoted the amplification and immunosuppressive function of breast cancer MDSCs in vitro and in vivo, and thus blocking the IL-6 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic strategy for eliminating and inhibiting MDSCs to improve prognosis. © 2017 Jiang, Chen, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Liu, Yu, Wei, Ren and Yu.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Because of the current epidemic of human papillomavirus (HPV)–related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), a screening strategy is urgently needed. The presence of serum antibodies to HPV-16 early (E) antigens is associated with an increased risk for OPC. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of antibodies to a panel of HPV-16 E antigens in screening for OPC. METHODS: This case-control study included 378 patients with OPC, 153 patients with nonoropharyngeal head and neck cancer (non-OPC), and 782 healthy control subjects. The tumor HPV status was determined with p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridization. HPV-16 E antibody levels in serum were identified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A trained binary logistic regression model based on the combination of all E antigens was predefined and applied to the data set. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for distinguishing HPV-related OPC from controls were calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the association of head and neck cancer with the antibody status. RESULTS: Of the 378 patients with OPC, 348 had p16-positive OPC. HPV-16 E antibody levels were significantly higher among patients with p16-positive OPC but not among patients with non-OPC or among controls. Serology showed high sensitivity and specificity for HPV-related OPC (binary classifier: 83% sensitivity and 99% specificity for p16-positive OPC). CONCLUSIONS: A trained binary classification algorithm that incorporates information about multiple E antibodies has high sensitivity and specificity and may be advantageous for risk stratification in future screening trials.

    "Abstract": "Background: Rapid genetic counseling and testing (RGCT) in newly diagnosed high-risk breast cancer (BC) patients may influence surgical treatment decisions. To successfully integrate RGCT in practice, knowledge of professionals’, and patients’ attitudes toward RGCT is essential. Methods: Between 2008 and 2010, we performed a randomized clinical trial evaluating the impact of RGCT. Attitudes toward and experience with RGCT were assessed in 265 patients (at diagnosis, 6- and 12-month follow-up) and 29 medical professionals (before and after the recruitment period). Results: At 6-month follow-up, more patients who had been offered RGCT felt they had been actively involved in treatment decision-making than patients who had been offered usual care (67% vs 48%, P = 0.06). Patients who received DNA-test results before primary surgery reported more often that RGCT influenced treatment decisions than those who received results afterwards (P < 0.01). Eighty-seven percent felt that genetic counseling and testing (GCT) should preferably take place between diagnosis and surgery. Most professionals (72%) agreed that RGCT should be routinely offered to eligible patients. Most patients (74%) and professionals (85%) considered surgeons the most appropriate source for referral. Conclusions: RGCT is viewed as helpful for newly diagnosed high-risk BC patients in choosing their primary surgery and should be offered routinely by surgeons. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background The shift from cytotoxic to targeted chemotherapy led to improved treatment outcomes in oncology. Nevertheless, many cancer patients cannot be cured from their disease because of the development of drug resistance and side effects. Purpose There is an ongoing quest for novel compounds, which raised not only the interest in natural products but also in novel combination therapy regimens. Study design In this review, we report on the inhibition epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by targeted small molecules and their combination with natural products from medicinal plants. Results The combination of erlotinib with artesunate leads to synergistic inhibition of cell growth in isobologram analyses. Artesunate is an approved anti-malaria drug, which is also active against cancer as shown in vitro, in vivo and in preliminary clinical phase I/II trials. Conclusion The combination of natural products (e.g. the sesquiterpenoid artesunate) and synthetic compounds (e.g. the small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib) may lead to improved clinical success rates in oncology. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",

    "Abstract": "Present study involves the synthesis and characterization of a newly designed tetrakis benzimidazolium salts, 1–5 and their respective tetra N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) dinuclear silver(I) complexes, 6–10 with different terminal substituents that constructed from either cyclopentyl, benzyl, n-butyl, 2-methylene benzonitrile or n-decyl. These well characterized compounds were then tested for anticancer potential by determining their IC 50 values and antiproliferative activity on HCT116, MCF-7 and HeLa cancer cell lines. Anticancer potential of these compounds was then determined by evaluating the mode of cytotoxicity of these novel compounds. Among the synthesized compounds, the proligand 5 and silver(I)-NHC complex, 10 having n-decyl substitution show selective antiproliferation activity against human colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116). All the complexes 6–10 and proligand 5 show moderate and strong antiproliferative activity against breast cancer and cervical cancer possibly by inhibiting colony formation and migration of cancer cells. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway is upregulated in many pancreatic cancer cells, and it is believed that carcinogenetic effects of COX-2 upregulation are largely through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) overproduction. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the association between urinary PGE2 metabolites (PGE-M), a biomarker of in vivo PGE2 overproduction, and pancreatic cancer risk. We conducted a case–control study with 722 subjects (239 cases and 483 controls) nested within two prospective cohort studies, the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) and Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS). Pre-diagnosis urine samples were measured for PGE-M using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), with adjustment for potential confounders. Compared to those with the lowest urine level of PGE-M (the first quartile), individuals with higher urine levels of PGE-M had an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, with adjusted ORs (95%CI) of 1.63 (0.98–2.73), 1.55 (0.90–2.69) and 1.94 (1.07–3.51), for the second to the fourth quartile groups, respectively (p for trend = 0.054). This dose–response positive association was more evident among those who had BMI &lt;25 kg/m 2 than overweight individuals (p for interaction = 0.058). After excluding cases diagnosed in the first year of follow-up and their matched controls, this positive association persisted (p for trend = 0.037) and the interaction became statistically significant (p for interaction = 0.017). Our study adds additional evidence that the COX-2 pathway is involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis and suggests that urinary PGE-M may serve as a biomarker for predicting pancreatic cancer risk. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: For many chemotherapy regimens dosed based on body surface area (BSA), patients experience dose reductions or delays or discontinue treatment, thereby reducing survival. Consideration of body composition may be useful in individualizing chemotherapy dosing, but to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined the association of body composition with chemotherapy tolerance in patients with colon cancer. METHODS: The authors identified patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer who were diagnosed from 2006 through 2011 at Kaiser Permanente and who received leucovorin calcium/calcium folinate, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as initial adjuvant chemotherapy (533 patients). Patients' muscle mass was quantified using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. The authors quantified chemotherapy doses, treatment dates, and related toxicities using the electronic medical record. In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, the authors examined associations of muscle tertiles with early treatment discontinuation (&lt;6 cycles), treatment delay (&gt;3 days off schedule for ≥3 times), and/or dose reduction (relative dose intensity ≤ 0.70, based on planned treatment). RESULTS: The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 58.7 years; BSA was 1.9 m2 and body mass index was 28.7 kg/m2. Compared with the highest sex-specific tertile of muscle mass, patients in the lowest tertile were more likely to experience toxicities and had twice the risk of adverse outcomes while receiving FOLFOX; for early discontinuation, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.34 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04-5.24; P for trend =.03), whereas the ORs were 2.24 (95% CI, 1.37-3.66; P for trend =.002) for treatment delay and 2.28 (95% CI, 1.19-4.36; P for trend =.01) for dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Lower muscle mass is associated with greater toxicity and poor chemotherapy adherence among patients receiving FOLFOX. Many chemotherapy drugs are dosed based on BSA, but treatment may be better individualized if muscle mass is considered.

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: The measurement of tumor regression after neoadjuvant oncological treatment has gained increasing interest because it has a prognostic value and because it may influence the method of treatment in rectal cancer. The assessment of tumor regression remains difficult and inaccurate with existing methods. Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) enables qualitative tissue differentiation by simultaneous scanning with different levels of energy. We aimed to assess the feasibility of DECT in quantifying tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy in loco-advanced rectal cancer. Methods: We enrolled 11 patients with histological and MRI verified loco-advanced rectal adenocarcinoma and followed up on them prospectively. All patients had one DECT scanning before neoadjuvant treatment and one 12 weeks after using the spectral imaging scan mode. DECT analyzing tools were used to determine the average quantitative parameters; effective-Z, water- and iodine-concentration, Dual Energy Index (DEI), and Dual Energy Ratio (DER). These parameters were compared to the regression in the resection specimen as measured by the pathologist. Results: Changes in the quantitative parameters differed significantly after treatment in comparison with pre-treatment, and the results were different in patients with different CRT response rates. Conclusion: DECT might be helpful in the assessment of rectal cancer regression grade after neoadjuvant treatment. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In cancer therapy, enhanced thymidine uptake by the salvage pathway can bypass dTMP depletion, thereby conferring resistance to thymidylate synthase inhibition. We investigated whether sequential combination therapy of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) could synergistically enhance antitumor efficacy in colon cancer xenograft models. We also examined 3'-deoxy-30-[18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT) PET as a means to predict therapeutic response to a sequential combination of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil. [3H]FLT uptake after 5-fluorouracil treatment in vitro and [18F]FLT uptake after capecitabine (360 mg/kg/day) in athymic nude mice (Balb/c-nu) with xenografts (n = 10-12 per group) were measured using eight human colon cancer cell lines. We determined the synergistic effects of sequential combinations of 5-fluorouracil and trifluridine in vitro as well as the sequential combination of oral capecitabine (30-360 mg/kg) and trifluridine/tipiracil (trifluridine 75 or 150 mg/kg with tipiracil) in six xenograft models (n = 6-10 per group). We observed significant increases in [3H]FLT uptake in all cell lines and [18F]FLT uptake in five xenograft models after 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine treatment, respectively. Increased [18F]FLT uptake after capecitabine followed by extinction of uptake correlated strongly with tumor growth inhibition (r = -0.81, P = 0.02). The effects of these combinations were synergistic in vitro. A synergy for sequential capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil was found only inmouse xenograftmodels showing increased [18F]FLT uptake after capecitabine. Our results suggest that the sequential combination of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil is synergistic in tumors with an activated salvage pathway after capecitabine treatment in mice, and [18F]FLT PET imaging may predict the response to capecitabine and the synergistic antitumor efficacy of a sequential combination of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil. © 2017 AACR.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Most high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients develop recurrent disease after first-line treatment, frequently with fatal outcome. This work aims at studying the molecular biology of both primary and recurrent HGSOC. Experimental Design: Gene expression profiles of matched primary and recurrent fresh-frozen tumor tissues from 66HGSOC patients were obtained by RNA sequencing. Clustering analyses and pairwise comparison of the profiles between matched samples and subsequent functional alignment were used for the identification of molecular characteristics of HGSOC. Results: Both primary and recurrent HGSOC samples presented predominant gene expression differences in their microenvironment, determined by a panel of genes covering all major pathways of immune activation together with a number of genes involved in the remodeling of extracellular matrix and adipose tissues. Stratifying tumor tissues into immune active and silent groups, we further discovered that although some recurrent tumors shared the same immune status as their primary counterparts, others switched the immune status, either from silent to active or active to silent. Interestingly, genes belonging to the B7-CD28 immune checkpoint family, known for their major role as negative regulators of the immune response, were overexpressed in the immune active tumors. Searching for potential tumor antigens, CEACAM21, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, was found to be significantly overexpressed in immune active tissues in comparison with the silent ones. Conclusions: The results illustrate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment inHGSOCandreveal themolecular relationship between primary and recurrent tumors, which have multiple therapeutic implications. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: We conducted a dose-finding study for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administered with cisplatin (CDDP) and mitomycin C (MMC) to find an improved regimen for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for advanced gastric cancer (GC). Methods: The appropriate HIPEC regimen previously determined in vitro was 5-FU (200 µg/mL), MMC (2 µg/mL), and CDDP (10 µg/mL) at hyperthermic conditions (42°C) for 30 min. This was a clinical study to determine the recommended dose of 5-FU in combination with MMC and CDDP at 42°C for 30 min and to evaluate HIPEC safety in patients at high risk of developing peritoneal metastases following GC surgery. Results: Twelve patients were treated with surgery plus HIPEC using 5-FU at 0, 500, 750, and 1000 mg combined with MMC (10 mg) and CDDP (50 mg) in the perfusate (5 L). Dose-limiting toxicities did not develop until 1000 mg 5-FU was reached. Four patients experienced grade 1 or 2 adverse events. The recommended dose was 1000 mg 5-FU/5 L perfusate. Eight (66.7%) patients demonstrated no recurrence of peritoneal metastases; 5-year overall survival rate was 83.3%. Conclusion: Gastrectomy and HIPEC with MMC, CDDP, and 5-FU is feasible, safe, and may protect against peritoneal metastasis following surgery for advanced GC. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Despite having reliable and excellent diagnostic performances, the currently available messenger RNA (mRNA) detection methods mostly use enzymatic amplification steps of the target mRNA which is generally affected by the sample manipulations, amplification bias and longer assay time. This paper reports an amplification-free electrochemical approach for the sensitive and selective detection of mRNA using a screen-printed gold electrode (SPE-Au). The target mRNA is selectively isolated by magnetic separation and adsorbed directly onto an unmodified SPE-Au. The surface-attached mRNA is then measured by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]4-/3- redox system. This method circumvents the PCR amplification steps as well as simplifies the assay construction by avoiding multiple steps involved in conventional biosensing approaches of using recognition and transduction layers. Our method has demonstrated good sensitivity (LOD = 1.0 pM) and reproducibility (% RSD = &lt;5%, for n = 3) for detecting FAM134B mRNA in two cancer cell lines and a small cohort of clinical samples (number of samples = 26) collected from patients with oesophageal cancer. The analytical performance of our method is validated with a standard qRT-PCR analysis. We believe that our PCR-free approach holds a great promise for the analysis of tumor-specific mRNA in clinical samples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Most cancer cells exhibit a high rate of glycolysis and reduced capacity in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) was found to be increased in many cancer cells. Inhibition of PDKs increases the oxidative phosphorylation of glucose, which may disrupt the balance between the demand and supply of oxygen in cancer cell, thus leading to cell death. Several reports suggested that compounds containing (R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionamide group could inhibit PDKs in pyruvate dehydrogenase primary enzymatic assay. However, none of them were capable of reducing the growth of cancer cells. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of some novel PDK1 inhibitors containing the (R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionamide warhead. Excitingly, these novel PDK1 inhibitors exhibited good potency to reduce the growth of cancer cells. We have demonstrated that these compounds could physically associate with PDK1 and activate pyruvate dehydrogenase in low micromolar levels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The discovery and development of a novel irreversible EGFR/HER2 dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor SHR1258 (pyrotinib) for the treatment of HER2-postive breast cancer is presented. The structure-activity relationship of lead series and their pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated to identify the potential candidates for further in vivo efficacy studies and preclinical safety assessments. Metabolic pathway and drug-drug interaction were also investigated in preclinical settings. In particular, major metabolites in human and animal species were assessed with regard to potential toxicity or off-target side effects. Overall, the potent and selective EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, pyrotinib, displayed robust anti-tumor effects on HER2-overexpressing xenograft models and sufficiently safety windows in animals as well as favorable pharmacokinetic properties in human, which substantially ensures current clinical development. Finally, recent advances of pyrotinib in clinical studies are highlighted with very encouraging outcomes in patients with HER2-postive advanced breast cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Gene fusions are frequently found in prostate cancer and may result in the formation of unique chimeric amino acid sequences (CASQ) that span the breakpoint of two fused gene products. This study evaluated the potential for fusion-derived CASQs to be a source of tumor neoepitopes, and determined their relationship to patterns of immune signatures in prostate cancer patients. Experimental Design: A computational strategy was used to identify CASQs and their corresponding predicted MHC class I epitopes using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas of prostate tumors. In vitro peptide-specific T-cell expansion was performed to identify CASQ-reactive T cells. A multivariate analysis was used to relate patterns of in silico-predicted tumor-infiltrating immune cells with prostate tumors harboring these mutational events. Results: Eighty-seven percent of tumors contained gene fusions with a mean of 12 per tumor. In total, 41% of fusion-positive tumors were found to encode CASQs. Within these tumors, 87% gave rise to predicted MHC class I-binding epitopes. This observation was more prominent when patients were stratified into low- and intermediate/high-risk categories. One of the identified CASQ from the recurrent TMPRSS2: ERG type VI fusion contained several high-affinity HLA-restricted epitopes. These peptides bound HLA-A∗02: 01 in vitro and were recognized by CD8+ T cells. Finally, the presence of fusions and CASQs were associated with expression of immune cell infiltration. Conclusions: Mutanome analysis of gene fusion-derived CASQs can give rise to patient-specific predicted neoepitopes. Moreover, these fusions predicted patterns of immune cell infiltration within a subgroup of prostate cancer patients. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy. This report describes the survival of children with ALL in the United States using the most comprehensive and up-to-date cancer registry data. METHODS: Data from 37 state cancer registries that cover approximately 80% of the US population were used. Age-standardized survival up to 5 years was estimated for children aged 0-14 years who were diagnosed with ALL during 2 periods (2001-2003 and 2004-2009). RESULTS: In total, 17,500 children with ALL were included. The pooled age-standardized net survival estimates for all US registries combined were 95% at 1 year, 90% at 3 years, and 86% at 5 years for children diagnosed during 2001-2003, and 96%, 91%, and 88%, respectively, for those diagnosed during 2004-2009. Black children who were diagnosed during 2001-2003 had lower 5-year survival (84%) than white children (87%) and had less improvement in survival by 2004-2009. For those diagnosed during 2004-2009, the 1-year and 5-year survival estimates were 96% and 89%, respectively, for white children and 96% and 84%, respectively, for black children. During 2004-2009, survival was highest among children aged 1 to 4 years (95%) and lowest among children aged <1 year (60%). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that overall net survival from childhood ALL in the United States is high, but disparities by race still exist, especially beyond the first year after diagnosis. Clinical and public health strategies are needed to improve health care access, clinical trial enrollment, treatment, and survivorship care for children with ALL. Cancer 2017;123:5178-89.

    "Abstract": "The mechanistic role of colonic low folate metabolic stress (LFMS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) malignancy development remains unknown. Folate analysis on the 99 paired human CRC tissues localized LFMS to the deep invasive T3/T4 staged tumours with hypo-methylated sonic hedgehog (Shh) promoter region and amplified expressions of Shh ligand and Gli1 effector, which coincided with deregulated expressions of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mediators. Colonic folate levels of CRC were inversely correlated with pluripotent expressions of the SOX2, NANOG and OCT4 markers (p < 0.05). Exposure of human colon adenocarcinoma cells to LFMS microenvironment significantly hypomethylated Shh promoter region, activated Shh signaling, induced transcript and protein expressions of the pluripotent markers, promoted trans-differentiation as EMT by deregulation of Snail mediator and epithelial marker E-cadherin, increased MMP2/MMP9 enzymatic digestion on matrix protein for invasion, and promoted self-renewal capability of anchorage-independent tumor-spheroid formation. LFMS-induced cancer stem cell (CSC) signature and CRC invasion is synergized with inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5AZA) in rewiring EMT genotypes, which can be blockade by the Shh inhibitor (cyclopamine). The in vivo and in vitro data corroboratively identify CSC-like molecular targets specific to the LFMS-predisposed invasive CRC through reprogramming DNA methylation-activated Shh signaling. The study highlights CSC targets specific to LFMS-predisposed invasive CRC in optimizing folate co-chemotherapy to minimize tumour metastasis potential of CRC patients. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is the 8th most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the tumor with the poorest prognosis of all solid malignancies. In 1957, it was discovered that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has oncolytic properties on tumor cells. To study the oncolytic properties of NDV in pancreatic cancer a single dose was administered intravenously in a syngeneic orthotopic tumor model using two different murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (DT6606PDA, Panc02). Tumor growth was monitored and immune response was analyzed. A single treatment with NDV inhibited DT6606PDA tumor growth in mice and prevented recurrence for a period of three months. Tumor infiltration and systemic activation of NK cells, cytotoxic and helper T-cells was enhanced. NDV-induced melting of Panc02 tumors until d7 pi, but they recurred displaying unrestricted tumor growth, low immunogenicity and inhibition of tumor-specific immune response. Arrest of DT6606PDA tumor growth and rejection was mediated by activation of NK cells and a specific antitumor immune response via T-cells. Panc02 tumors rapidly decreased until d7 pi, but henceforth tumors characterized by the ability to perform immune-regulatory functions reappeared. Our results demonstrated that NDV-activated immune cells are able to reject tumors provided that an adaptive antitumor immune response can be initiated. However, activated NK cells that are abundant in Panc02 tumors lead to outgrowth of nonimmunogenic tumor cells with inhibitory properties. Our study emphasizes the importance of an adaptive immune response, which is initiated by NDV to mediate long-term tumor surveillance in addition to direct oncolysis. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Background: Well-known anti-malarial drug artemisinin exhibits potent anti-cancerous activities. In-vivo and in-vitro studies showed its anti-tumor and immunomodulatory properties signifying it as a potent drug candidate for study. The studies of mechanisms of cell movement are relevant which can be understood by knowing the involvement of genes in an effect of a drug. Although cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative activity of artemisinin is evident, the genes participating in its anti-migratory and reduced invasive effect are not well studied. The present study reports the alteration in the expression of 84 genes involved in cell motility upon artemisinin treatment in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using pathway focused gene expression PCR array. In addition, the effect of artemisinin on epigenetic modifier HDACs is studied. Methods: We checked the functional stimulus of artemisinin on cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis in breast cancerous cell lines. Using qRT-PCR and western blot, we validated the altered expression of relevant genes associated with proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and mammary gland development. Results: Artemisinin inhibited cell proliferation of estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cells with fewer efficacies in comparison to estrogen receptor positive ones. At the same time, cell viability and proliferation of normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells was un-affected. Artemisinin strongly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Along with orphan nuclear receptors (ERRα, ERRβ and ERRγ), artemisinin altered the ERα/ERβ/PR/Her expression status of MCF-7 cells. The expression of genes involved in the signaling pathways associated with proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis was significantly altered which cooperatively resulted into reduced growth promoting activities of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, artemisinin exhibited inhibitory effect on histone deacetylases (HDACs).

    "Abstract": "Targeted oncogene inactivation by small molecule inhibitors can be very effective but tumor recurrence is a frequent problem in the clinic. Therapy by inactivation of the cancer-driving oncogene in transplanted tumors was shown to be augmented in the presence of T cells. However, these experiments did not take into account the long-term, usually tolerogenic, interaction of de novo malignancies with the immune system. Here, we employed mice, in which SV40 large T (Tag) and firefly luciferase (Luc) as fusion protein (TagLuc) could be regulated with the Tet-on system and upon activation resulted in tumors after a long latency. TagLuc inactivation induced profound tumor regression, demonstrating sustained oncogene addiction. While tumor relapse after TagLuc inactivation was prevented in immunocompetent mice bearing transplanted tumors, autochthonous tumors relapsed or recurred after therapy discontinuation indicating that the immune system that coevolved with the malignancy over an extended period of time lost the potency to mount an efficient anti-tumor immune response. By contrast, adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells targeting the cancer-driving oncogene eradicated recurrent autochthonous tumors, highlighting a suitable therapy option in a clinically relevant model. © 2017 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of UICC",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we propose doxorubicin (DOX) loaded oligonucleotides (ONTs) attached to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a drug delivery system for cancer chemotherapy. DOX is one of the representative cancer chemotherapy agents and is widely used by many researchers as a chemotherapy agent in the drug delivery system. Due to the advantages of AuNPs such as simple steps in synthesis, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, and biocompatibility, we utilized AuNPs as drug delivery vehicle. AuNPs were synthesized by chemical reduction to be 13 nm diameter. The G-C rich oligonucleotides were used both for drug loading sites and AuNPs capping agents. 80% of DOX in solution could be bound to ONTs on AuNPs to became DOX-loaded AuNPs coated with ONTs (Doxorubicin-Oligomer-AuNP, DOA), and about 28% of loaded DOX was released from the as-prepared DOA. Confocal microscopy observation showed that DOA was well transported into cells, and finally the DOX was released into the cell nucleus. The drug's efficacies such as in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo tumor growth inhibition were demonstrated with SW480 colon cancer cell line and a xenograft mouse model. MTT assay was performed to see the cytotoxicity effect on SW480 cells treated with DOA for 24 h, and the cell viability was determined to be 41.77% (p < 0.001). When DOA was administered regularly to a tumor bearing mouse, the tumor growth inhibition degree was examined by measuring the tumor size. The treatment-control (T/C) ratio was found to be 0.69. Thus, our results suggest the use of DOAs as promising drug delivery systems for colorectal cancer therapy. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",

Chiral compounds synthesized by this strategy potently inhibited the proliferation of several breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies suggest that the most potent compound 9e can directly interfere with MDM2-p53 interactions and elevate protein levels of p53 and p21, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial apoptosis. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The serine/threonine kinase STK33 has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation. Here, we provide evidence of a critical role for STK33 in the pathogenesis and metastatic progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). STK33 expression in PDAC was regulated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1a. In human PDAC specimens, STK33 was overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Enforced STK33 expression promoted PDAC proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth, whereas STK33 depletion exerted opposing effects. Mechanistic investigations showed that HIF1a regulated STK33 via direct binding to a hypoxia response element in its promoter. In showing that dysregulated HIF1a/STK33 signaling promotes PDAC growth and progression, our results suggest STK33 as a candidate therapeutic target to improve PDAC treatment. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Multidrug resistance is the main obstacle in cancer chemotherapy. Emerging evidence demonstrates the important role of autophagy in cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, autophagy inhibition by natural compounds may be a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance in liver cancer cells. Here, we found that ADCX, a natural cycloartane triterpenoid extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) source Cimicifugae rhizoma (Shengma), impaired autophagic degradation by suppressing lysosomal cathepsin B (CTSB) expression in multidrug-resistant liver cancer HepG2/ADM cells, thereby leading to autophagic flux inhibition. Moreover, impairing autophagic flux promoted ADCX-induced apoptotic cell death in HepG2/ADM cells. Interestingly, Akt was overactivated by ADCX treatment, which downregulated CTSB and inhibited autophagic flux. Together, our results provide the first demonstration that an active TCM constituent can overcome multidrug resistance in liver cancer cells via Akt-mediated inhibition of autophagic degradation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: To determine whether radical resection can benefit patients with advanced gallbladder adenocarcinoma using a Bayesian network (BN) with clinical data. Methods: In total, 362 patients who had undergone surgical treatment of gallbladder adenocarcinoma at a tertiary institute were evaluated to establish two BN models using a tree-augmented naïve Bayes algorithm. We then chose 250 patients with T3-4N0-2M0 stage gallbladder adenocarcinoma to test the posterior probability after the surgical type was taken into account. Results: In total, 170 patients (≤7 months) and 137 patients (>7 months) were correctly classified in the median survival time model (accuracy, 84.81%), and 204 patients (≤12 months), 15 patients (12-36 months), 17 patients (36-60 months), and 34 patients (>60 months) were correctly classified in the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival model (accuracy, 74.59%), respectively. Every posterior probability in the two models upregulated the ratio of the longer survival time and suggested a better prognosis for gallbladder adenocarcinoma that can be improved by R0 resection. Conclusions: These BN models indicate that stages T4 and N2 gallbladder adenocarcinoma are not contraindications for surgery and that R0 resection can improve survival in patients with advanced gallbladder adenocarcinoma. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the detection of Bladder Cancer (BC) via mid infrared spectroscopy. Two main contributions, material and methods, are presented. In terms of material, a new minimally invasive technology, combining fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy and newly patented biosensors, is used for the first time to acquire mid-infrared spectra from voided urine/bladder wash. This new machine promises practicality, cheapness and high-quality of spectrum acquisition. As for classical systems, the data acquired using the new system was highly correlated, resulting in a poor classification performance using classical methods. Therefore, the second contribution consists in developing statistical methods that alleviate the problem. Three new statistical methods based on Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis algorithm (PLSDA) are proposed. PLSDA is a supervised classifier well-known for its ability to process correlated data. The key point is the choice of the most discriminant latent variables in the training step. In this work, we propose three new decision rules in order to select the most relevant latent variables. These decision rules give rise to three algorithms, namely bayesian, joint and best model PLSDA. A comparative study between the proposed methods and standard ones, namely SVM, K-MEANS and classical PLSDA, confirms clearly the efficiency of the former. The best performance in terms of accuracy is achieved by joint and best model PLSDA (82.35%). Besides, by embedding the proposed statistical methods in the new machine, we are able to provide a new medical device that is very promising in terms of automatic bladder cancer detection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Anastomotic leak (AL) is a serious complication of low anterior resection (LAR). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of transanal tube placement for prevention of AL. Methods: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled 328 consecutive patients who underwent LAR for rectal cancer at participating hospitals from 2009 to 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding factors. Results: A transanal tube was placed in 205 patients (TA group) and not placed in 123 patients (non-TA group). Symptomatic AL occurred in 36 cases (11%), with significantly higher incidence of symptomatic AL in the non-TA group than in the TA group (15% vs 8.3%, odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-4.06). After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate analysis revealed that placement of a transanal tube could decrease the incidence of symptomatic AL (adjusted OR 0.37, 95%CI 0.15-0.91). There was no significant difference in postoperative morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, or local recurrence rate between the two groups. Local recurrence rate tended to be higher in patients with symptomatic AL (3/36) than in those without it (10/292). Conclusions: Transanal tube placement is effective for decreasing the incidence of symptomatic AL after LAR. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Few investigators have described en bloc resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) invading the aorta. Aim of Study: Analysis of outcome and prognostic factors for en bloc resections of NSCLC invading the aorta. Methods: Thirty-five patients (27 males, 8 females; mean age 63 ± 8.6 years) were operated between 1994 and 2015 in four European Centers. Histology: 12 (34.3%) squamous cell carcinoma, and 6 (17.1%) undifferentiated/large cell carcinoma. The site of aortic infiltration was the descending thoracic aorta in 24 (68.6%) patients, the aortic arch in 9 (25.7%), and the aortic arch and supraortic trunks in 2 (5.7%). Results: Lung resection consisted of pneumonectomy in 19 (54.3%) patients and lobectomy in 16 (45.7%). Aortic resection management was undertaken by endograft positioning (37.1%), subadventitial dissection (37.1%), cardiopulmonary/aorto-aortic bypass (17.2%), and direct clamping (8.6%). A tubular graft replacement was carried out in five cases, a synthetic patch repair in 6. Mortality was 2.9%, morbidity 37.1%. Patients undergoing pneumonectomy had a significantly higher morbidity rate compared with lobectomy (52% vs 18.7%; P = 0.003), although patients managed with aortic endografting had a lower complication rate. Median overall and disease-free survival rates were 31.3 and 22.2 months, respectively. Gender and site of aortic infiltration were independent prognostic factors.

    "Abstract": "Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes counteract many oncogenic kinase pathways. In cancer cells, PP2A function can be compromised by several mechanisms, including sporadic mutations in its scaffolding A and regulatory B subunits or more frequently through overexpression of cellular PP2A inhibitors. Here, we identify a novel genetic mechanism by which PP2A function is recurrently affected in human cancer, involving haploinsufficiency of PPP2R4, a gene encoding the cellular PP2A activator PTPA. Notably, up to 70% of cancer patients showed a heterozygous deletion or missense mutations in PPP2R4. Cancer-associated PTPA mutants exhibited decreased abilities to bind the PP2A-C subunit or activate PP2A and failed to reverse the tumorigenic phenotype induced by PTPA suppression, indicating they function as null alleles. In Ppp2r4 gene-trapped (gt) mice showing residual PTPA expression, total PP2A activity and methylation were reduced, selectively affecting specific PP2A holoenzymes. Both PTPAgt/gt and PTPA+/gt mice showed higher rates of spontaneous tumors, mainly hematologic malignancies and hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. These tumors exhibited increased c-Myc phosphorylation and increased Wnt or Hedgehog signaling. We observed a significant reduction in lifespan in PTPA+/gt mice compared with wild-type mice. In addition, chemical-induced skin carcinogenesis was accelerated in PTPA+/gt compared with wild-type mice. Our results provide evidence for PPP2R4 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene, defining a high-penetrance genetic mechanism for PP2A inhibition in human cancer. © 2017 AACR.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimmed to evaluate the expression of p53-inducible RR small subunit 2 homologue (p53R2) in Lung sarcomatoid carcinoma (LSC) and its association with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. Methods: In this study, clinicopathological factors and prognostic significance of the expression of p53R2 was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 100 cases of LSC. Results: The results showed that the expression of p53R2 was significantly correlated with clinical stage (P<0.05). But there was no statistically correlation with gender, age, smoking, tumor size, pT stage, pN stage, pM stage, therapy and relapse. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the expression of p53R2, clinical stage, pT stage, pN stage, pM stage and tumor size were closely related to patients' survival, and the analysis also revealed that patients with low expression of p53R2 had a longer overall survival than that with high expression (Mean overall survival: 84.8 months vs. 34.7 months, P<0.05). Further multivariate analysis indicated that the expression of p53R2 was identified as an independent prognostic factor in the prediction of the overall survival for patients with LSC (HR = 3.217, P<0.05). Conclusions: The expression of p53R2 was inversely associated with the proliferation and progression of LSC, and the results indicated that the high expression of p53R2 was an independent factor for unfavorable prognosis of patients with LSC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early-phase trials in patients with recurrent neuroblastoma historically used an objective “response” of measureable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST], without bone/bone marrow assessment) to select agents for further study. Historical cohorts may be small and potentially biased; to the authors' knowledge, disease recurrence studies from international registries are outdated. Using a large recent cohort of patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma from Children's Oncology Group (COG) modern-era early-phase trials, the authors determined outcome and quantified parameters for designing future studies. METHODS: The first early-phase COG trial enrollment (sequential) of 383 distinct patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma on 23 phase 1, 3 phase 1/2, and 9 phase 2 trials (August 2002 to January 2014) was analyzed for progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and time to disease progression (TTP). Planned frontline therapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma included hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (approximately two-thirds of patients underwent ≥1 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation); 13.2% of patients received dinutuximab. RESULTS: From the time of the patient's first early-phase trial enrollment (383 patients), the 1-year and 4-year PFS rates (± standard error) were 21% ± 2% and 6% ± 1%, respectively, whereas the 1-year and 4-year OS rates were 57% ± 3% and 20% ± 2%, respectively. The median TTP was 58 days (interquartile range, 31-183 days [350 patients]); the median follow-up was 25.3 months (33 patients were found to be without disease recurrence/progression). The median time from diagnosis to first disease recurrence/progression was 18.7 months (range, 1.4-64.8 months) (176 patients). MYCN amplification and 11q loss of heterozygosity were prognostic of worse PFS and OS (P =.003 and P<.0001, respectively, and P =.02 and P =.03, respectively) after early-phase trial enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: This recent COG cohort of patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma is inclusive and representative. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first meta-analysis of PFS, TTP, and OS within the context of modern therapy. These results will inform the design of future phase 2 studies by providing a) historical context during the search for more effective agents; and, b) factors prognostic of PFS and OS after disease recurrence to stratify randomization.

    "Abstract": "Herein, we report an alternative synthetic approach for selected 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine CDK inhibitor conjugates with folic acid as a drug-delivery system targeting folate receptors. In contrast to the previously reported approaches, the desired conjugates were constructed stepwise using solid-phase synthesis starting from immobilized primary amines. The ability of the prepared conjugates to release the free drug was verified using dithiothreitol (DTT) and glutathione (GSH) as liberating agents. Finally, binding to the folate receptor (FOLR1) overexpressed in a cancer cell line was measured by flow cytometry using a fluorescent imaging probe. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "AIM: The study aimed to identify factors that influence the positivity of axillary lymph nodes in patients with early breast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, who were subjected for modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 81 surgically treated, early breast cancer patients during the period from 08-2015 to 05-2017. All the cases have been analysed by standard histological analysis including macroscopic and microscopic examination by routine H&E staining. For determination of molecular receptors, immunostaining by PT LINK immunoperoxidase has been done for HER2neu, ER, PR, p53 and Ki67. RESULTS: Patients age ranged between 31-73 years, an average of 56.86 years. The mean size of a primary tumour in the surgically treated patient was 20.33 ± 6.0 mm. Axillary dissection revealed from 5 to 32 lymph nodes, with an average of 14. Metastases have been found in 1 to 7 lymph nodes, with an average 0.7. Only 26 (32.1%) of the patients showed metastases in the axillary lymph nodes. The univariant regression analysis showed that the size of a tumour and presence of HER2neu receptors on cancer cells influence the positivity of the axillary lymph nodes. The presence of the estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors have no influence on the positivity for metastatic deposits of lymph nodes. Multivariant model and logistic regression analysis as significant independent factors or predictors of positivity of the axillary lymph nodes are influenced by the tumour size only. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the metastatic involvement of the axillary lymph nodes is mainly influenced by the size of a tumour and presence of HER2neu receptors in the univariant analysis. This point to the important influence of positivity of the axillary lymph nodes but, in multi-variant regressive analysis the lymph node status correlates with the tumour size only. © 2017 Borislav Kondov, Rosalinda Isijanovska, Zvonko Milenkovikj, Gordana Petrusevska, Marija Jovanovski-Srceva, Magdalena Bogdanovska-Todorovska, Goran Kondov.",

    "Abstract": "The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination therapy is an emerging trend in tumor immunology. However, the value of combination immunotherapy remains controversial, because of the toxic effects induced by combination. The added benefit of each additional drug has not been assessed against the added toxicity. We searched for clinical trials that evaluated ICI monotherapies and combination therapies in lung cancer and melanoma patients. The overall response rate (ORR), grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse event rate, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were extracted from the most recently published studies to determine the relative risk (RR), hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Seven randomized controlled trials and one open-label study were identified (n = 3,097). Treatments included combinations of several ICIs, a combination of an ICI and dacarbazine, two combinations of an ICI, paclitaxel and carboplatin, and a combination of an ICI and gp100 vaccine. Higher ORR (RR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.03–2.20, p = 0.034), OS (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78–0.95, p = 0.000), and PFS (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.72–1.14, p = 0.000) values were observed in combination therapy than in monotherapy. In addition, the toxicity of combination ICI immunotherapy was higher (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03–2.19, p = 0.036) than that of monotherapy. This meta-analysis showed that the addition of nivolumab to ipilimumab better benefits PFS and ORR. Adding sargramostim was associated with better OS and safety. The efficacy and safety of a nivolumab-ipilimumab-sargramostim combination should be investigated further. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Correct staging of pancreatic cancer is paramount, as treatment is stage specific. However, minimally invasive tools to facilitate staging are lacking. DNA promoter hypermethylation is a hallmark of cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate promoter hypermethylation in cell-free DNA as a prognostic marker for stage classification of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Consecutive patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were prospectively included. Plasma samples were obtained before diagnostic work-up and treatment. Patients were staged according to the TNM classification. Methylation-specific PCR of 28 genes was performed. Prognostic prediction models for staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were developed by multivariable logistic regression analysis using stepwise backwards elimination. Ninety-five patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included. The mean number of hypermethylated genes was identical for stage I, II and III disease (7.09 (95% CI; 5.51–8.66), 7.00 (95% CI; 5.93–8.07) and 6.77 (95% CI; 5.08–8.46)), respectively, and highly significantly different from stage IV disease (10.24 (95% CI; 8.88–11.60)). The prediction model (SEPT9v2, SST, ALX4, CDKN2B, HIC1, MLH1, NEUROG1, and BNC1) enabled the differentiation of stage IV from stage I-III disease (AUC of 0.87 (cut point 0.55; sensitivity 74%, specificity 87%)). Model (MLH1, SEPT9v2, BNC1, ALX4, CDKN2B, NEUROG1, WNT5A, and TFPI2) enabled the differentiation of stage I-II from stage III-IV disease (AUC of 0.82 (cut point 0.66; sensitivity 73%, specificity 80%)). Cell-free DNA promoter hypermethylation has the potential to be blood-based prognostic markers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as panels of hypermethylated genes enables the differentiation according to cancer stage. However, further validation is required. © 2017 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: We sought to validate the commonly used prognostic models and staging systems for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in a large multi-center patient cohort. Methods: The overall (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) prognostic discriminatory ability of various commonly used models were assessed in a large retrospective cohort. Harrell's concordance index (c-index) was used to determine accuracy of model prediction. Results: Among 1054 ICC patients, median OS was 37.7 months and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, were 78.8%, 51.5%, and 39.3%, respectively. Recurrence of disease occurred in 454 (43.0%) patients with a median DFS of 29.6 months. One-, 3- and 5- year DFS were 64.6%, 46.5 % and 44.4%, respectively. The prognostic models associated with the best OS prediction were the Wang nomogram (c-index 0.668) and the Nathan staging system (c-index 0.639). No model was proficient in predicting DFS. Only the Wang nomogram exceeded a c-index of 0.6 for DFS (c-index 0.602). The c-index for the AJCC staging system was 0.637 for OS and 0.582 for DFS. Conclusions: While the Wang nomogram had the best discriminatory ability relative to OS and DFS, no ICC staging system or nomogram demonstrated excellent prognostic discrimination. The AJCC staging for ICC performed reasonably, although its overall discrimination was only modest-to-good. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Activation of the PI3K–AKT signaling cascade is a common critical event during malignant transformation. In this study, we used thyroid gland epithelial cells and a series of genetically engineered mouse strains as model systems to demonstrate that, although necessary, AKT activation is not sufficient for PI3K-driven transformation. Instead, transformation requires the activity of the PDK1-regulated AGC family of protein kinases. In particular, SGK1 was found to be essential for proliferation and survival of thyroid cancer cells harboring PI3K-activating mutations. Notably, cotargeting SGK1 and AKT resulted in significantly higher growth suppression than inhibiting either PI3K or AKT alone. Overall, these findings underscore the clinical relevance of AKT-independent pathways in tumors driven by genetic lesions targeting the PI3K cascade. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "DHHC-type protein acyltransferases may regulate the localization, stability, and/or activity of their substrates. In this study, we show that the protein palmitoyltransferase DHHC3 is upregulated in malignant and metastatic human breast cancer. Elevated expression of DHHC3 correlated with diminished patient survival in breast cancer and six other human cancer types. ZDHHC3 ablation in human MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cell xenografts reduced the sizes of both the primary tumor and metastatic lung colonies. Gene array data and fluorescence dye assays documented increased oxidative stress and senescence in ZDHHC3-ablated cells. ZDHHC3-ablated tumors also showed enhanced recruitment of innate immune cells (antitumor macrophages, natural killer cells) associated with clearance of senescent tumors. These antitumor effects were reversed upon reconstitution with wild-type, but not enzyme-active site-deficient DHHC3. Concomitant ablation of the upregulated oxidative stress protein TXNIP substantially negated the effects of ZDHHC3 depletion on oxidative stress and senescence. Diminished DHHC3-dependent palmitoylation of ERGIC3 protein likely played a key role in TXNIP upregulation. In conclusion, DHHC3-mediated protein palmitoylation supports breast tumor growth by modulating cellular oxidative stress and senescence. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "The selective destruction of tumour cells while sparing healthy tissues is one of the main challenges in cancer therapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are arguably the most rapidly expanding class of targeted cancer therapies. Efficient drug conjugation and release technologies are essential for the development of these new therapeutic agents. In response to the ever-increasing demand for efficient drug release systems, we have developed a new class of β-galactosidase-cleavable linkers for ADCs. Within this framework, novel payloads comprising a galactoside linker, the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and cysteine-reactive groups were synthesized, conjugated with trastuzumab and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The ADCs with galactoside linkers demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy in mice compared to the marketed trastuzumab emtansine used for the treatment of breast cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Bioconjugate formats provide alternative strategies for antigen targeting with bispecific antibodies. Here, PSMA-targeted Fab conjugates were generated using different bispecific formats. Interchain disulfide bridging of an αCD3 Fab enabled installation of either the PSMA-targeting small molecule DUPA (SynFab) or the attachment of an αPSMA Fab (BisFab) by covalent linkage. Optimization of the reducing conditions was critical for selective interchain disulfide reduction and good bioconjugate yield. Activity of αPSMA/CD3 Fab conjugates was tested by in vitro cytotoxicity assays using prostate cancer cell lines. Both bispecific formats demonstrated excellent potency and antigen selectivity. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "The development of multitarget anticancer agents is of high interest to medicinal chemists in terms of overcoming drug resistance and preventing cancer-cell migration. Based on the structure of the potent carborane-containing estrogen BE120, non-steroidal multitarget anti-breast cancer agent candidates 1a–1j were designed and synthesized. Compound 1f shows potent STS-inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.8 μM), cell-growth-inhibitory (CGI) activity against 39 human cancer cell lines (MG-MID = 2.8 μM), and tubulin-polymerization-inhibitory (TPI) activity. An analysis of the DNA content for MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells revealed that 1f arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and induces apoptosis. Accordingly, 1f should be a promising therapeutic agent for hormone-dependent breast cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "A series of phosphorus porphyrin complexes ([(RO)2P(tpp)]Cl, tpp = tetraphenylporphyrinato group, R = −(CH2CH2O)m(CH2)nH; 1a: m = 2, n = 2; 1b: m = 2, n = 4; 1c: m = 2, n = 6; 1d: m = 3, n = 6) were used for the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of human biliary cancer cell line (NOZ) when exposed to the irradiation of light emitting diodes (LEDs). A Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing NOZ cells (2000 cell well−1) and 1 (0–100 nM) was introduced into a 96-well microplate and incubated for 24 h to accumulate 1 into the NOZ cells and to multiply the NOZ cells until the cell number reached 104 cells well−1. After replacing the DMEM medium containing 1 with a fresh DMEM medium without 1, the plates were irradiated for 30 min at 610 nm. After incubation was performed for 24 h in dark conditions, the cell viability of the NOZ cells was determined using the MTT assay. The half maximum inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50) of 1a–1d were found to be in the range of 33.7–58.7 nM for NOZ. These IC50 values for the NOZ were one hundredth the IC50 value (7.57 μM) for mono-L-aspartyl chlorin e6 (laserphyrin®). Thus, it was found that the PDT activity of 1a–1d was much higher than the mono-L-aspartyl chlorin e6. Similarly, IC50 vales of 1a–1d for HeLa cells were found to be 27.8–52.5 nM. This showed that 1a–1d had high photodynamic activity in cancer cells. At the same time, it was speculated that an LED is a useful light source for deactivating the cancer cells because it can excite the sensitizers with peak width in their absorption spectra using the light of the specified wave length with band width of 10–20 nm; LEDs provide a homogeneous light distribution for the target cells. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: In recent years, there has been growing concern about the overuse of colonoscopy (CC). Our objective was to evaluate the incidence rate and cumulative probability of having a potentially inadequate CC (PI-CC, e.g. a CC that was performed earlier that recommended) and the association between the report of a hyperplastic polyp in the baseline CC report and the probability of having a PI-CC. Methods: A retrospective cohort of adults 50y/o or older with a complete baseline CC between January 1st and December 31st 2005, without reported lesions or with hyperplastic polyps, based on secondary data extracted from the electronic medical record of the Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires. The outcome consisted of time until a PI-CC, defined as the time measured between basal colonoscopy and a colonoscopy performed earlier than the inter-screening interval recommended by the USPSTF and the USMSTF. Results: 389 patients were included. The cumulative probability of receiving a PI-CC over 10 years was 0.29 (95% CI 0.241, 0.342). The incidence rate resulted in 30.91 PI-CC per 1000 person-years (95% CI 25.14, 38). The crude analysis of the association between the outcome and the presence of hyperplastic polyps in the baseline CC, showed a statistically significant difference between both groups (log rank, p 0.036). The multivariate analysis yielded a hazard ratio of 1.67 (95% CI 1.02-2.73). Conclusion: We observed that 3 in every 10 patients treated in our health system received a PI-CC during the first ten consecutive years after a normal complete CC. Furthermore, this could be in part attributed to the presence of a hyperplastic polyp in the baseline CC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Histone demethylase JARID1B plays several context dependent roles in epigenetic regulation of cellular differentiation in normal development and is highly expressed in multiple human cancers. The protein is a strong transcriptional repressor capable of downregulating numerous genes. There are three splicing isoforms of JARID1B, however the links between the protein structure and function are not clear. The expression pattern of JARID1B in human melanoma seems to be different from observed in other cancers. Moreover, up to now no data on the impact of JARID1B expression in cutaneous melanoma on the patients' prognosis have been reported. Methods: We investigated immunohistochemically the association of intratumoral expression of total JARID1B protein and its RBP2-H1 isoform in primary and metastatic melanomas with prognosis for the patients. Results: Expression of both total JARID1B protein and its RBP2-H1 variant was found in all the melanomas investigated. Our results indicate, however, that only high (above 90% of the cells) intratumoral expression of RBP2-H1 can be considered prognostic factor associated with worse overall survival of the patients. Conclusions: Such results if considered together with data demonstrating a switch to enhanced expression of RBP2-H1 at early stages of malignant transformation of melanocytes are in agreement with hypothetical crucial role of JARID1B in the course of melanoma development and progression and suggest that altered splicing of JARID1B may be important factor increasing melanoma aggressiveness. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the feasibility of cyclodextrin-modified calcium phosphate nanoparticles delivering siRNA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer cell model A549. Methods: The alendronate-β-cyclodextrin modifier was synthesized chemically. The calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CACaP/siRNA NPs) was prepared and optimized by mixing methods, and the particle size analyzer and gel blocking method were used to determine the stability. The cytotoxicity of CACaP/siRNA NPs and the cell uptake of siRNA in A549 cells were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometer, respectively. Moreover, the expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in A549 cells was detected by RT-PCR and Western-blot, respectively. Results: CACaP/siRNA nanoparticles modified by the alendronate-β-cyclodextrin were stable and uniform (200 nm and -14 mV), which had good stability and serum protection and could maintain more than 90% of the cell viability in A549 cells. Meaningfully, it could be transfected into the cells efficiently and down-regulated the expression of EGFR mRNA by 70%, moreover, significantly inhibited the expression of EGFR protein in A549 cells. Conclusion: Cyclodextrin-modified calcium phosphate nanoparticles could effectively deliver siRNA to human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, which possesses a better prospect in vivo application. © 2017, Chinese Journal of New Drugs Co.

    "Abstract": "Using a novel mouse model, a mitochondrial-nuclear exchange model termed MNX, we tested the hypothesis that inherited mitochondrial haplotypes alter primary tumor latency and metastatic efficiency. Male FVB/N-Tg(MMTVneu)202Mul/J (Her2) transgenic mice were bred to female MNX mice having FVB/NJ nuclear DNA with either FVB/NJ, C57BL/6J, or BALB/cJ mtDNA. Pups receiving the C57BL/6J or BALB/cJ mitochondrial genome (i.e., females crossed with Her2 males) showed significantly (P < 0.001) longer tumor latency (262 vs. 293 vs. 225 days), fewer pulmonary metastases (5 vs. 7 vs. 15), and differences in size of lung metastases (1.2 vs. 1.4 vs. 1.0 mm diameter) compared with FVB/NJ mtDNA. Although polyoma virus middle T–driven tumors showed altered primary and metastatic profiles in previous studies, depending upon nuclear and mtDNA haplotype, the magnitude and direction of changes were not the same in the HER2-driven mammary carcinomas. Collectively, these results establish mitochondrial polymorphisms as quantitative trait loci in mammary carcinogenesis, and they implicate distinct interactions between tumor drivers and mitochondria as critical modifiers of tumorigenicity and metastasis. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "We and others have previously reported a correlation between high phosphodiesterase 3 A (PDE3A) expression and selective sensitivity to phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. This indicates that PDE3A could serve both as a drug target and a biomarker of sensitivity to PDE3 inhibition. In this report, we explored publicly available mRNA gene expression data to identify cell lines with different PDE3A expression. Cell lines with high PDE3A expression showed marked in vitro sensitivity to PDE inhibitors zardaverine and quazinone, when compared with those having low PDE3A expression. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical stainings were in agreement with PDE3A mRNA expression, providing suitable alternatives for biomarker analysis of clinical tissue specimens. Moreover, we here demonstrate that tumor cells from patients with ovarian carcinoma show great variability in PDE3A protein expression and that level of PDE3A expression is correlated with sensitivity to PDE inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate that PDE3A is highly expressed in subsets of patient tumor cell samples from different solid cancer diagnoses and expressed at exceptional levels in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) specimens. Importantly, vulnerability to PDE3 inhibitors has recently been associated with co-expression of PDE3A and Schlafen family member 12 (SLFN12). We here demonstrate that high expression of PDE3A in clinical specimens, at least on the mRNA level, seems to be frequently associated with high SLFN12 expression. In conclusion, PDE3A seems to be both a promising biomarker and drug target for individualized drug treatment of various cancers. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In this study the effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast cancer MCF-7/BUS cells was assessed by means of in vitro assay. The cells were exposed in the absence of estrogens to AgNPs alone or in combination with aluminum chloride (AlCl3), butyl paraben (BPB) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBPh). The results revealed that AgNPs at the non-cytotoxic concentrations (up to 2 μg/mL) and AlCl3 (up to 500 μM) did not induce proliferation of MCF-7/BUS cells whereas BPB and DBPh showed strong estrogenic activity with the highest effect at 16 μM and 35 μM, respectively. AgNPs inhibited the proliferation of the cells induced by DBPh, BPB or even with 17β-estradiol (E2) during 6-day incubation in the absence of estrogens. ICI 182,780 (10 nM), a known estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, induced strong inhibitory effect. AgNPs also decreased transcription of the estrogen-responsive pS2 and progesterone receptor (PGR) genes but modulated expression neither of ERα nor ERβ in MCF-7/BUS cells exposed to BPB, DBPh or E2 for 6 h. Our results indicate that AgNPs may inhibit growth of breast cancer cells stimulated by E2 or estrogenic chemicals, i.e. BPB and DBPh. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",
