    "Abstract": "Tumorigenesis requires accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations, some of which drive tumor initiation. “Oncogene addiction” describes the phenomenon that (1) well-established cancers are dependent on one mutated oncogene or pathway for the maintenance of a malignant phenotype and that (2) withdrawal of the single oncogenic event leads to growth arrest and/or cancer regression. While oncogene addiction has been experimentally validated in advanced tumor models, its role in tumor precursors has not been investigated. We utilized the requirement of Forkhead box A1 (Foxa1) for transcriptional activation of the Upk2-promoter to temporally control the expression of Upk2-HRAS* oncogene, an inducer of urothelial hyperplasia in transgenic mice. Inducible homozygous knockout of Foxa1 in Upk2-HRAS*/UBC-Cre ERT2 /Foxa1 loxp/loxp mice results in reduced HRAS* levels. This led to a marked reduction of urothelial proliferation as evidenced by urothelial thinning, degenerative changes such as intracellular vacuole formation, and reduced Ki67 expression. Reduced proliferation did not affect basal, Krt14-positive cells, supporting the fact that Foxa1-regulated Upk2-HRAS* expression occurs primarily in supra-basal cells. Our results indicate that maintenance of urothelial hyperplasia in Upk2-HRAS* mice depends on continuous expression of Foxa1 and activated HRAS, and that mutated receptor tyrosine kinases, FOXA1 and/or other downstream effectors may mediate oncogene addiction in urothelial hyperplasia. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metabolism changes extensively during the normal proliferation and differentiation of mammalian cells, and in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Since changes in the metabolic network reflect interactions between genetic, epigenetic and environmental changes, it is helpful to study the flow of label from isotopically labelled precursors into other metabolites rather than static metabolite levels. For this Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an attractive technique as it can quantify site-specific label incorporation. However, for applications using human cells and cell lines, the challenge is to optimize the process to maximize sensitivity and reproducibility. Here we present a new framework to analyze metabolism in mammalian cell lines and primary cells, covering the workflow from the preparation of cells to the acquisition and analysis of NMR spectra. We have applied this new approach in hematological and liver cancer cell lines and confirm the feasibility of tracer-based metabolism in primary liver cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "As the first line of innate immune cells to migrate towards tumour tissue, neutrophils, can immediately kill abnormal cells and activate long-term specific adaptive immune responses. Therefore, the enzymes mediated elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) bioinspired by neutrophils can be a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we design a core-shell supramolecular hybrid nanogel via the surface phosphatase triggered self-assembly of oligopeptides around iron oxide nanoparticles to simulate productive neutrophil lysosomes. The cascade reaction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and chloroperoxidase (CPO) within the bioinspired nanogel can convert ROS in tumour tissue to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and the subsequent singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) species. Studies on both cells and animals demonstrate successful 1 O 2 -mediated cell/tumour proliferation inhibition, making this enzyme therapy capable for treating tumours without external energy activation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a lethal form of the disease, is characterized by loss of androgen receptor (AR) signaling during neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, which results in resistance to AR-targeted therapy. Clinically, genomically and epigenetically, NEPC resembles other types of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Through pan-NET analyses, we identified ONECUT2 as a candidate master transcriptional regulator of poorly differentiated NETs. ONECUT2 ectopic expression in prostate adenocarcinoma synergizes with hypoxia to suppress androgen signaling and induce neuroendocrine plasticity. ONEUCT2 drives tumor aggressiveness in NEPC, partially through regulating hypoxia signaling and tumor hypoxia. Specifically, ONECUT2 activates SMAD3, which regulates hypoxia signaling through modulating HIF1α chromatin-binding, leading NEPC to exhibit higher degrees of hypoxia compared to prostate adenocarcinomas. Treatment with hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 potently reduces NEPC tumor growth. Collectively, these results highlight the synergy between ONECUT2 and hypoxia in driving NEPC, and emphasize the potential of hypoxia-directed therapy for NEPC patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The human gastric mucosa is the most active layer of the stomach wall, involved in food digestion, metabolic processes and gastric carcinogenesis. Anatomically, the human stomach is divided into seven regions, but the protein basis for cellular specialization is not well understood. Here we present a global analysis of protein profiles of 82 apparently normal mucosa samples obtained from living individuals by endoscopic stomach biopsy. We identify 6,258 high-confidence proteins and estimate the ranges of protein expression in the seven stomach regions, presenting a region-resolved proteome reference map of the near normal, human stomach. Furthermore, we measure mucosa protein profiles of tumor and tumor nearby tissues (TNT) from 58 gastric cancer patients, enabling comparisons between tumor, TNT, and normal tissue. These datasets provide a rich resource for the gastrointestinal tract research community to investigate the molecular basis for region-specific functions in mucosa physiology and pathology including gastric cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA lung cancer associated transcript 1 (LUCAT1) has been shown to be a lncRNA that facilitates the development and progression of several tumours. However, the evidence of LUCAT1 modulating the growth and metastasis of cervical cancer (CC) were still lacking. The present study aimed to explore the expression pattern, biological function and potential mechanism of LUCAT1 in CC. In this study, we, first, confirmed that LUCAT1 acted as an up-regulated lncRNA by analyzing the data from GCTA dataset and RT-PCR in both CC tissues and cell lines. We also showed that TINCR overexpression is induced by nuclear transcription factor SP1. Then, clinical assays showed that LUCAT1 was associated with advanced clinical progression and poor prognosis of CC patients. Importantly, multivariate Cox model confirmed that LUCAT1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both 5-year overall survival in CC. Then, lost-function assays revealed that knockdown of LUCAT1 significantly suppressed CC cells proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and EMT by a series of cells experiments. Mechanistically, Bioinformatic tools predicted that miR-181a may target LUCAT1, which was confirmed using luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Overall, our findings showed that SP1-activated LUCAT1 exerts an oncogenic function in CC by binding to miR-181a, suggesting that miR-181a may be a ponderable and promising therapeutic target for CC.",

    "Abstract": "Fragile histidine triad (FHIT) serves a critical function as a tumor suppressor that inhibits p53 degradation by mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). The functional domains of FHIT involved in tumor inhibition was interpreted. In-silico screening data were employed to construct truncated forms of FHIT to assess their cytotoxic effects on the HT1080 cell line. Full FHIT expression was confirmed by western blotting and expression of two FHIT truncates were confirmed by RT-PCR. Transfection of these truncated forms into HT1080 cells showed that the N-terminal truncated form (amino acids 17-102) better inhibited proliferation than the full-length FHIT. The combined effects of these truncated forms augmented doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Functional analysis demonstrated that these fragments and their combination with doxorubicin can arrest cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle as specified by flow cytometry. The FHIT functional domains can be used as lead compounds for development of drug designs and gene transfer for cancer therapy. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "The Piwi-like genes belong to the Argonaute gene family and are conserved in plants, animals and humans. In addition to their essential role in the germ line and as stem cell-associated genes, Piwi-like proteins play a role in different cancer types but have yet to be studied in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We investigated tissue micro arrays (TMAs) with tumor samples of two independent cohorts of RCC patients (N = 265 and N = 345); we used immunohistochemistry to assess the protein expression of Piwi-like 1. Applying an immunoreactive score (IRS), we found Piwi-like 1 positivity (IRS > 0) in 28.3% and 14.8% of the tumors in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Piwi-like 1 positivity was correlated with Fuhrman grade, tumor stage and the presence of distant metastasis (P < 0.005). Moreover, in univariate and multivariate analyses (adjusted to Fuhrman grade and tumor stage), Piwi-like 1 positivity was associated with a shorter cancer-specific survival in the patients in the second cohort. In addition, Piwi-like 1 expression allowed to further distinguish the RCC patients with high Fuhrman grade, high tumor stage, distant metastasis or high pre-operative levels of C-reactive protein, as Piwi-like 1 positivity was associated with a shorter cancer-specific survival in both cohorts. Our data encourage further investigations to enlighten the role of Piwi-like 1 and its function as a marker of poor prognosis in RCC patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Nab-paclitaxel) offer more efficient paclitaxel delivery into tumor cells with fewer side effects than conventional chemotherapies. However, whether the efficacy of Nab-paclitaxel for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is age-related remains unknown. We performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the anticancer efficacy and safety of Nab-paclitaxel in NSCLC. Hazard ratios (HRs) or rate ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes were retrieved. Thirteen high-quality studies with 4613 patients were included, of which five were comparative trials comparing nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin (nab-P/C) with solvent-based paclitaxel plus carboplatin (sb-P/C), and the others were non-comparative trials investigating the nab-paclitaxel efficacy. Pooled comparative trial estimates showed that nab-P/C significantly improved overall response rates ([RR]: 1.31) and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 0.89) and overall survival (OS) (HR: 0.93) compared with the control. However, meta-analysis of the younger subgroup indicated that PFS (HR: 93) and OS (HR: 96) were similar between the two arms. Regarding safety, nab-paclitaxel significantly increased risk for grade ≥3 anaemia. For non-hematological adverse events, grade ≥3 sensory neuropathy and arthralgia occurred more frequently in the control arm than in the experimental arm. In conclusion: Nab-paclitaxel is effective and safe for NSCLC patients, especially the elderly.",

    "Abstract": "A novel nanoparticle (Au-LTSL-GA.A) uses the thermosensitive liposome (LTSL) to encapsulate ganoderic acid A (GA.A), which successfully transforms the polarity of GA.A and has excellent water solubility. The multifunctional Au-LTSL-GA.A, a self-assembled thermal nanomaterial, was used in antibacterial and anticancer applications in combination with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. The designed Au-LTSL-GA.A nanoparticle was used as a nano-photosensitizer to achieve synergistic photochemotherapy based on the phototherapy sensitization property of Au nanorods (NRs) and antitumour activity of GA.A. In the antibacterial experiments, the Au-LTSL-GA.A + NIR irradiation had a broad-spectrum antibacterial effect, exhibiting a strong antibacterial activity against drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) compared with the raw GA.A and LTSL-GA.A. In the anticancer experiments, Au-LTSL-GA.A + NIR irradiation, which combined phototherapy sensitization property of Au NRs with antitumour activity of GA.A, exhibited high anticancer activity against MCF-7 cells. The IC50 value of Au-LTSL-GA.A + NIR irradiation (12.1 ± 1.3 μg/mL) was almost similar to cisplatin in MCF-7 cells. The evaluation of the potential in vivo toxicity of Au-LTSL-GA.A revealed no toxicity in mice. The results of this study suggest that Au-LTSL-GA.A has a wide range of potential industrial and clinical applications, such as in antibacterial treatment and cancer photochemotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of protosappanin B on the proliferation and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. The effects of protosappanin B (12.5, 25, 50, 100, or 200 μg/mL, 48 h) on proliferation of SV-HUC-1, T24 and 5637 cells was assessed using the MTT assay. The effects of protosappanin B (100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 μg/mL, 48 h) on cell apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed using flow cytometry. T24 and 5637 cells treated with 200 µg/mL protosappanin B showed morphological changes (shrinkage, rounding, membrane abnormalities, and reduced adhesion), but protosappanin B had no proliferation arrest effect on SV-HUC-1 cells. Protosappanin B caused concentration-dependent inhibition of cell growth, with IC50 of 82.78 µg/mL in T24 cells and 113.79 µg/mL in 5637 cells. Protosappanin B caused concentration-dependent increases in T24 and 5637 cell apoptosis (100–300 µg/mL). The effects of protosappanin B on the cell cycle in both cell types was G1 arrest with reductions in the proportion of S-phase cells and proliferation index. A proteomics analysis showed that protosappanin B modulated a number of genes involved in the cell cycle. In conclusion, protosappanin B inhibits the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of T24 and 5637 human bladder cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, possibly via interference with cell cycle regulation, preventing G1-to-S transition. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite the advances in the development of chemotherapeutic agents, resistance to chemotherapy and adverse side effects are still big challenges against successful cancer treatment. To overcome these problems, one strategy is the application of nanomaterials and drug delivery systems to efficiently deliver the anticancer agents to tumour tissues with minimum toxic effects on healthy organs. In this study a graphene oxide nanohybrid (GO/NHs) was designed and fabricated for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil (FU) to the breast cancer MCF7 cells. After preparation and characterization of GO/NHs, several biological analysis including haemolysis assay, cytotoxicity assay, cellular uptake, apoptosis assay, and protein expression were performed. The cytotoxic effects of FU, FU loaded GO/NHs (FU-GO/NHs), and blank GO/NHs was determined by MTT assay. The results of MTT assay showed no significant cytotoxicity for blank nano-hybrid on MCF7 cells. Furthermore, FU-GO/NHs were more cytotoxic than free FU. The uptake analysis results showed that developed nanocarrier could completely be internalized into the cells in the first hour. Besides, apoptotic effects and nuclear morphology changes of cells was evaluated by DAPI staining under fluorescent microscopy. Protein expression levels of p53, PARP, cleaved PARP, Bcl-2, and Bax were determined by western blot analysis. Western blot results showed higher levels of p53 and cleaved PARP after treatment with FU-GO/NHs, however, no substantial effect was observed for Bax and Bcl-2 protein concentrations.",

    "Abstract": "Adiposity is an increasing public health problem in China. We aimed to examine the associations of adiposity with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and other chronic liver diseases in Chinese adults. The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank recruited 512,891 adults aged 30–79 years from 10 areas. During 10 years of follow-up, 7,386 incident liver disease cases were recorded among 503,991 participants without prior cancer or chronic liver disease at baseline. The mean body mass index (BMI) (SD) was 23.7 (3.3) kg/m 2 and mean waist circumference (WC) 80.3 (9.8) cm, with 33% having BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 . Throughout the range examined (BMI 15–50) BMI showed a log-linear positive association with NAFLD (n = 1,298), with adjusted HR per 5 kg/m 2 of 2.81 (95% CI 2.63–3.01), adjusting for regression dilution. There were also positive associations of percent body fat, WC, and waist-to-hip ratio with NAFLD, with HRs per 1-SD of 2.27 (2.14–2.41), 2.60 (2.44–2.76), and 1.84 (1.76–1.92). BMI was unrelated to viral hepatitis (n = 1,477), and had a U-shaped association with cirrhosis (n = 2,082) and an inverse association with liver cancer (n = 2,568), which disappeared after excluding the first 5 years of follow-up. Among Chinese adults, adiposity was a major risk factor for NAFLD but not other chronic liver diseases. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The chemotherapeutic drugs, loaded in nanocarriers, have recently attracted the pharmaceutical industries due to their limited adverse side effects. The objective of the current study was to incorporate the ifosfamide (IFO) into two different essential oils-based nanoemulsions, lemon (LEM-IFO) and salvia (SAL-IFO). The antiproliferation activities of the resulted formulas were evaluated in the MCF-7 breast cancer cells and HeLa cervical cancers cells. The cytotoxic effect of the NE formulas was detected by the MTT assay, DAPI stain and light microscopy. The z-average diameters range of LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO, determined by the zetasizer, were 49.15–61.81 nm and 56.64–64.62 nm, respectively. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO, applied into the HeLa cells, were 0.165 ± 0.025 and 0.141 ± 0.035 mM, respectively, whereas the IC50 of LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO subjected into the MCF-7 cells were 0.200 ± 0.005 mM and 0.270 ± 0.025 mM, respectively. The IC50 of the free IFO was markedly larger than LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO when applied into MCF-7 cells (9.20 ± 2.01 mM) and HeLa cells (7.69 ± 1.88 mM). Among the tested formulas, LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO have the greatest apoptotic effect on the MCF-7 and HeLa cells, respectively. Solubilizing the IFO in the essential oils-based NE has ameliorated the antitumor efficacy of IFO. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bone is one of the preferred sites for the metastasis of malignant tumours, such as breast cancer, lung cancer and malignant melanoma. Tumour cells colonizing bone have the capacity to induce the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), which promotes osteoclast differentiation and activation. Tumour-induced osteoclastic bone resorption leads to a vicious cycle between tumours and bone cells that fuels osteolytic tumour growth, causing bone pain and hypercalcaemia. Furthermore, RANKL contributes to bone metastasis by acting as a chemoattractant to bone for tumour cells that express its receptor, RANK. Thus inhibition of the RANKL–RANK pathway is a promising treatment for bone metastasis, and a human monoclonal anti-RANKL antibody, denosumab, has been used in the clinic. However, orally available drugs targeting RANKL must be developed to increase the therapeutic benefits to patients. Here we report the efficacy of the small-molecule RANKL inhibitor AS2676293 in treating bone metastasis using mouse models. Oral administration of AS2676293 markedly inhibited bone metastasis of human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231-5a-D-Luc2 as well as tumour-induced osteolysis. AS2676293 suppressed RANKL-mediated tumour migration in the transwell assay and inhibited bone metastasis of the murine cell line B16F10, which is known not to trigger osteoclast activation. Based on the results from this study, RANKL inhibition with a small-molecule compound constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for treating bone metastasis by inhibiting both osteoclastic bone resorption and tumour migration to bone. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Different types of Artemisia aucheri extracts were reported to have various biological activities including a cytotoxic effect on some cancer cell lines. We investigated the antiproliferative activity of isolated sesquiterpenoids from petroleum ether extract of Artemisia aucheri (A. aucheri) aerial parts on SK-N-MC, MCF-7, and A2780 cell lines. Phytochemicals from the petroleum ether cold macerated extract were isolated using normal phase vacuum liquid chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography (VLC and HPLC) and the structures of the components were determined by spectroscopic means. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Activation of caspases-3 and-9 was evaluated using a spectrophotometer. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured using rhodamine 123 fluorescent dye. Two tetrahydrofuran-type sesquiterpenoids, hydroperoxide of davanone (1) and hydroxydavanone (2) were isolated and characterized. Between these compounds, compound 1 exhibited more potent activity against the MCF-7, SK-N-MC and A2780 cell lines with IC 50 values of 8.45 ± 0.81 µg/mL, 9.60 ± 1.32 µg/mL and 10.9 ± 2.03 µg/mL in A2780, MCF-7 and SK-N-MC cells, respectively. Compound 1 inhibited the growth of human cancer cells by induction of apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study on cytotoxic and apoptotic mechanism of two davanone derivatives isolated from A. aucheri in human cancer cells. Overall, our data suggest that hydroperoxide of davanone (1) should be further studied in-vivo as a potential antitumor agent. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Today, drug resistance is one of the major problems in fight against cancer. Therefore, combination of therapeutic strategies was raised to effectively improve disease prognosis. In this regard, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are considered significant due to their anticancer properties. This study aimed to return sensitivity to cisplatin to A2780 cisplatin-resistance cell lines in the presence of biogenic synthesis curcumin-coated silver nanoparticles (cAgNPs). Synergic cellular effects of cAgNPs and cisplatin on ovarian carcinoma 2780 resistant to cisplatin cells were assessed using MTT assay, Acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI), DAPI staining, Annexin V/PI assay, and caspase 3/9 activation assay. Finally, expression of p53 and MMP-9 genes were evaluated using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). According to the results, 8 µg/mL and 62 µg/mL of cAgNPs and cisplatin led to 50% cell death in 48 h, respectively. Therefore, we combined non-toxic concentration of nanoparticles (1-5 µg/mL) with cisplatin (2.5 µg/mL). Decreased proliferation rate was about 50% for synergic use of cisplatin (2.5 µg/mL) and cAgNPs (2 µg/ mL). According to the results, cell death induction significantly increased by AO/PI, DAPI staining and Annexin V/PI assay in the combined group. Moreover, activity of caspase 3/9 significantly increased in the mentioned group. The combined use of cAgNPs and cisplatin resulted in upregulated expression of p53 gene and downregulated expression of MPP-9 gene. As observed in this study, a combination of cAgNPs and cisplatin increased the efficiency of apoptosis induction in A2780 cells, compared to the independent use of cisplatin or cAgNPs. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Quinones such as 1,4-naphthoquinones are abundant in nature and naphthoquinone based natural products are known to possess anticancer activity. This pharmacophore is known to convey anticancer activity to some drugs such as streptonigrin, mitomycin A, etc. We synthesized and characterized different classes of naphthoquinone derivatives including bis naphthoquinone, 2-arylaminonaphthoquinone, benzoxantene-6,11-dione and benzoacridine-5,6-dione derivatives instead of the expected 2-hydroxy-3-(substituted phenyl(aryl amino) methyl)naphthalene-1,4-dione derivatives from the reaction of 2-hydroxy1,4-naphthoquinone (lawson) with different benzaldehydes and aryl amines. Benzoacridine-5,6-dione derivatives and related imines showed potent anti-breast cancer activity in MCF-7 cancer cells. The in-vitro results revealed that five compounds benzoacridinedione derivatives (6b and 7b) and imines (13, 14 and 15) by the IC 50 range of 5.4-47.99 μM are the most potent anti-breast cancer structures. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is one of the defining features of cancer and abnormal metabolism is associated with many other pathologies. Molecular imaging techniques capable of detecting such changes have become essential for cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and surveillance. In particular, 18 F-FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET has emerged as an essential imaging modality for cancer because of its unique ability to detect a disturbed molecular pathway through measurements of glucose uptake. However, FDG-PET has limitations that restrict its usefulness in certain situations and the information gained is limited to glucose uptake only. 13 C magnetic resonance spectroscopy theoretically has certain advantages over FDG-PET, but its inherent low sensitivity has restricted its use mostly to single voxel measurements unless dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) is used to increase the signal, which brings additional complications for clinical use. We show here a new method of imaging glucose metabolism in vivo by MRI chemical shift imaging (CSI) experiments that relies on a simple, but robust and efficient, post-processing procedure by the higher dimensional analog of singular value decomposition, tensor decomposition. Using this procedure, we achieve an order of magnitude increase in signal to noise in both dDNP and non-hyperpolarized non-localized experiments without sacrificing accuracy. In CSI experiments an approximately 30-fold increase was observed, enough that the glucose to lactate conversion indicative of the Warburg effect can be imaged without hyper-polarization with a time resolution of 12s and an overall spatial resolution that compares favorably to 18 F-FDG PET. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The transmembrane zink-metalloendopeptidase neprilysin (NEP) is implicated in cardiovascular disease but also tumor biology. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship of circulating NEP (cNEP) levels with established cardiovascular biomarkers and its effect on overall survival in an unselected cohort of treatment-naïve cancer patients. 555 consecutive cancer patients prior anticancer therapy were enrolled prospectively. NEP levels were determined alongside routine laboratory parameters, established cardiac biomarkers, i.e. NT-proBNP, hsTnT, MR-proANP, MR-proADM, CT-proET-1 and Copeptin, and inflammatory parameters, i.e. CRP, IL-6 and SAA, in venous plasma samples. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint. cNEP levels of 276 pg/ml (IQR: 0–5981) displayed a weak inverse correlation with age [r = −0.12, p = 0.023] and inflammatory status [r = −0.14, p = 0.007 CRP; r = −0.20, p < 0.001 IL-6 and r = −0.18, p < 0.001 SAA]. cNEP was comparable between different tumor entities and stages and not related to functional parameters of other organ systems as kidney, liver or especially the heart. Moreover, cNEP was not associated with overall survival in the total cohort [adj.HR for ln (cNEP) 1.00, 95% CI: 0.94–1.06, p = 0.887] but in myelodysplatic malignancies [adj.HR for ln (cNEP) 1.27, 95% CI: 1.01–1.61, p = 0.044]. In conclusion, cNEP lacks association with outcome but for myelodysplastic disease. cNEP shows no correlation with established cardiovascular biomarkers related to prognosis, thereby holding a limited potential as a biomarker in cardio-oncology. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "PES1, a BRCT domain-containing protein, has been shown to play a role in modulating the balance and ratio between ERα and ERβ protein, which is involved in the occurrence and development of breast and ovarian cancer. However, its role in connection with the balance and ratio between ERα and ERβ protein in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains unclear. Here, we found that ERα and ERβ were co-expressed in human PTC tissues and cells. ERα promoted and ERβ inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of PTC cells. PES1 modulated the balance between ERα and ERβ by elevating the ERα protein level and simultaneously reducing the ERβ protein level, then upregulating the ERα/ERβ protein ratio and promoting the proliferation, invasion and migration of PTC cells. In PTC tissues, PES1 protein level was positively correlated with the ERα protein level and negatively correlated with the ERβ protein level. The PES1 and ERα protein levels were gradually increased and the ERβ protein level was decreased by degree in the occurrence and development of PTC. Increased PES1 and ERα protein levels and decreased ERβ protein level were correlated with the aggressive behaviors of PTC patients such as large tumor size, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), lymph node metastasis (LNM), high BRAFV600E expression and high TNM stage. It is suggested that PES1 promotes the occurrence and development of PTC by elevating the ERα protein level and reducing the ERβ protein level, and then upregulating the ERα/ERβ protein ratio. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The MYC oncogene is dysregulated in approximately 30% of liver cancer. In an effort to exploit MYC as a therapeutic target, including in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), strategies have been developed on the basis of MYC amplification or gene translocation. Due to the failure of these strategies to provide accurate diagnostics and prognostic value, we have developed a Negative Elongation Factor E (NELFE)-Dependent MYC Target (NDMT) gene signature. This signature, which consists of genes regulated by MYC and NELFE, an RNA binding protein that enhances MYC-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, is predictive of NELFE/MYC-driven tumors that would otherwise not be identified by gene amplification or translocation alone. We demonstrate the utility of the NDMT gene signature to predict a unique subtype of HCC, which is associated with a poor prognosis in three independent cohorts encompassing diverse etiologies, demographics, and viral status. The application of gene signatures, such as the NDMT signature, offers patients access to personalized risk assessments, which may be utilized to direct future care. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The interactions between tumor cells with their microenvironments, including hypoxia, acidosis and immune cells, lead to the tumor heterogeneity which promotes tumor progression. Here, we show that SIAH2-NRF1 axis remodels tumor microenvironment through regulating tumor mitochondrial function, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization and cell death for tumor maintenance and progression. Mechanistically, low mitochondrial gene expression in breast cancers is associated with a poor clinical outcome. The hypoxia-activated E3 ligase SIAH2 spatially downregulates nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression including pyruvate dehydrogenase beta via degrading NRF1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1) through ubiquitination on lysine 230, resulting in enhanced Warburg effect, metabolic reprogramming and pro-tumor immune response. Dampening NRF1 degradation under hypoxia not only impairs the polarization of TAMs, but also promotes tumor cells to become more susceptible to apoptosis in a FADD-dependent fashion, resulting in secondary necrosis due to the impairment of efferocytosis. These data represent that inhibition of NRF1 degradation is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Traditional radiomics involves the extraction of quantitative texture features from medical images in an attempt to determine correlations with clinical endpoints. We hypothesize that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could enhance the performance of traditional radiomics, by detecting image patterns that may not be covered by a traditional radiomic framework. We test this hypothesis by training a CNN to predict treatment outcomes of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, based solely on their pre-treatment computed tomography image. The training (194 patients) and validation sets (106 patients), which are mutually independent and include 4 institutions, come from The Cancer Imaging Archive. When compared to a traditional radiomic framework applied to the same patient cohort, our method results in a AUC of 0.88 in predicting distant metastasis. When combining our model with the previous model, the AUC improves to 0.92. Our framework yields models that are shown to explicitly recognize traditional radiomic features, be directly visualized and perform accurate outcome prediction. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "For a newly synthesized compound, identifying its target protein is a slow but pivotal step toward understand its pharmacologic mechanism. In this study, we systemically synthesized novel manzamine derivatives and chose 1-(9′-methyl-3′-carbazole)-3, 4-dihydro-β-carboline (MCDC) as an example to identify its target protein and function. MCDC had potent toxicity against several cancer cells. To identify its target protein, we first used a docking screen to predict macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as the potential target. Biochemical experiments, including mutation analysis and hydrogen-deuterium exchange assays, validated the binding of MCDC to MIF. Furthermore, MCDC was shown by microarrays to interfere with the cell cycle of breast cancer MCF7 cells. The activated signaling pathways included AKT phosphorylation and S phase-related proteins. Our results showed MIF as a potential direct target of a newly synthesized manzamine derivative, MCDC, and its pharmacologic mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Primary triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are prone to dissemination but sub-clonal relationships between tumors and resulting metastases are poorly understood. Here we use cellular barcoding of two treatment-naïve TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to track the spatio-temporal fate of thousands of barcoded clones in primary tumors, and their metastases. Tumor resection had a major impact on reducing clonal diversity in secondary sites, indicating that most disseminated tumor cells lacked the capacity to ‘seed’, hence originated from ‘shedders’ that did not persist. The few clones that continued to grow after resection i.e. ‘seeders’, did not correlate in frequency with their parental clones in primary tumors. Cisplatin treatment of one BRCA1-mutated PDX model to non-palpable levels had a surprisingly minor impact on clonal diversity in the relapsed tumor yet purged 50% of distal clones. Therefore, clonal features of shedding, seeding and drug resistance are important factors to consider for the design of therapeutic strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has become increasingly important for the clinical assessment of prostate cancer (PCa), but its interpretation is generally variable due to its relatively subjective nature. Radiomics and classification methods have shown potential for improving the accuracy and objectivity of mpMRI-based PCa assessment. However, these studies are limited to a small number of classification methods, evaluation using the AUC score only, and a non-rigorous assessment of all possible combinations of radiomics and classification methods. This paper presents a systematic and rigorous framework comprised of classification, cross-validation and statistical analyses that was developed to identify the best performing classifier for PCa risk stratification based on mpMRI-derived radiomic features derived from a sizeable cohort. This classifier performed well in an independent validation set, including performing better than PI-RADS v2 in some aspects, indicating the value of objectively interpreting mpMRI images using radiomics and classification methods for PCa risk assessment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The inflammatory response, modulated both by tissue resident macrophages and recruited monocytes from peripheral blood, plays a critical role in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we sought a model to interrogate human immune behavior in vivo. We determined that primary human monocytes and macrophages survive in zebrafish for up to two weeks. Flow cytometry revealed that human monocytes cultured at the physiological temperature of the zebrafish survive and differentiate comparable to cohorts cultured at human physiological temperature. Moreover, key genes that encode for proteins that play a role in tissue remodeling were also expressed. Human cells migrated within multiple tissues at speeds comparable to zebrafish macrophages. Analysis of gene expression of in vivo educated human macrophages confirmed expression of activated macrophage phenotypes. Here, human cells adopted phenotypes relevant to cancer progression, suggesting that we can define the real time immune modulation of human tumor cells during the establishment of a metastatic lesion in zebrafish. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Colon tumours are hierarchically organized and contain multipotent self-renewing cells, called Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). We have previously shown that the Notch1 receptor is expressed in Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs); given the critical role played by Notch signalling in promoting intestinal tumourigenesis, we explored Notch1 expression in tumours. Combining lineage tracing in two tumour models with transcriptomic analyses, we found that Notch1+ tumour cells are undifferentiated, proliferative and capable of indefinite self-renewal and of generating a heterogeneous clonal progeny. Molecularly, the transcriptional signature of Notch1+ tumour cells highly correlates with ISCs, suggestive of their origin from normal crypt cells. Surprisingly, Notch1+ expression labels a subset of CSCs that shows reduced levels of Lgr5, a reported CSCs marker. The existence of distinct stem cell populations within intestinal tumours highlights the necessity of better understanding their hierarchy and behaviour, to identify the correct cellular targets for therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Although B cell response is frequently found in cancer, there is little evidence that it alters tumor development or progression. The process through which tumor-associated antigens trigger humoral response is not well delineated. We investigate the repertoire of antigens associated with humoral immune response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using in-depth proteomic profiling of immunoglobulin-bound proteins from PDAC patient plasmas and identify tumor antigens that induce antibody response together with exosome hallmark proteins. Additional profiling of PDAC cell-derived exosomes reveals significant overlap in their protein content with immunoglobulin-bound proteins in PDAC plasmas, and significant autoantibody reactivity is observed between PDAC cell-derived exosomes and patient plasmas compared to healthy controls. Importantly, PDAC-derived exosomes induce a dose-dependent inhibition of PDAC serum-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. In summary, we provide evidence that exosomes display a large repertoire of tumor antigens that induce autoantibodies and exert a decoy function against complement-mediated cytotoxicity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Stability regulation of RAS that can affect its activity, in addition to the oncogenic mutations, occurs in human cancer. However, the mechanisms for stability regulation of RAS involved in their activity and its roles in tumorigenesis are poorly explored. Here, we identify WD40-repeat protein 76 (WDR76) as one of the HRAS binding proteins using proteomic analyses of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) tissue. WDR76 plays a role as an E3 linker protein and mediates the polyubiquitination-dependent degradation of RAS. WDR76-mediated RAS destabilization results in the inhibition of proliferation, transformation, and invasion of liver cancer cells. WDR76 −/− mice are more susceptible to diethylnitrosamine-induced liver carcinogenesis. Liver-specific WDR76 induction destabilizes Ras and markedly reduces tumorigenesis in HRas G12V mouse livers. The clinical relevance of RAS regulation by WDR76 is indicated by the inverse correlation of their expressions in HCC tissues. Our study demonstrates that WDR76 functions as a tumor suppressor via RAS degradation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor vascularization is a hallmark of cancer central to disease progression and metastasis. Current anti-angiogenic therapies have limited success prompting the need to better understand the cellular origin of tumor vessels. Using fate-mapping analysis of endothelial cell populations in melanoma, we report the very early infiltration of endovascular progenitors (EVP) in growing tumors. These cells harbored self-renewal and reactivated the expression of SOX18 transcription factor, initiating a vasculogenic process as single cells, progressing towards a transit amplifying stage and ultimately differentiating into more mature endothelial phenotypes that comprised arterial, venous and lymphatic subtypes within the core of the tumor. Molecular profiling by RNA sequencing of purified endothelial fractions characterized EVPs as quiescent progenitors remodeling the extracellular matrix with significant paracrine activity promoting growth. Functionally, EVPs did not rely on VEGF-A signaling whereas endothelial-specific loss of Rbpj depleted the population and strongly inhibited metastasis. The understanding of endothelial heterogeneity opens new avenues for more effective anti-vascular therapies in cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA exhibits differential expression levels in cancer and can affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis. Although fluorescence techniques using dye molecule labels have been studied, label-free molecular-level quantification of miRNA is extremely challenging. We developed a surface plasmon resonance sensor based on two-dimensional nanomaterial of antimonene for the specific label-free detection of clinically relevant biomarkers such as miRNA-21 and miRNA-155. First-principles energetic calculations reveal that antimonene has substantially stronger interaction with ssDNA than the graphene that has been previously used in DNA molecule sensing, due to thanking for more delocalized 5s/5p orbitals in antimonene. The detection limit can reach 10 aM, which is 2.3–10,000 times higher than those of existing miRNA sensors. The combination of not-attempted-before exotic sensing material and SPR architecture represents an approach to unlocking the ultrasensitive detection of miRNA and DNA and provides a promising avenue for the early diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is a rare but most aggressive form of monoclonal gammopathies. PCL is characterized by the presence of clonal plasma cells in peripheral blood. There are two forms of PCL - primary which presents de novo in patients with no evidence of previous multiple myeloma and secondary which is a leukemic transformation of relapsed or refractory dis-ease in patients with previously recognized multiple myeloma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is the first study to provide information on PCL epidemiology in the Czech population us-ing The Czech National Cancer Registry (CNCR) as the basic source of data for the population-based evaluation of PCL epidemiology. RESULTS: Accord-ing to CNCR data, there were on average six newly dia-gnosed cases of PCL and four deaths caused by PCL each year in the Czech Republic in the period 2000-&#8202;2015. PCL incidence in the Czech Republic was reported at 0.57 per million in 2000-&#8202;2015. We suppose that most reported cases of PCL are primary PCL because secondary PCL is a relapse of a previously reported myeloma and, in most cases, is not coded as an independent dia-gnosis in the CNCR. CONCLUSION: Data from registries such as the CNCR can provide useful information on epidemiology of various dis-eases. These data, however, have several limitations, such as dia-gnostic criteria and proper cod-ing of not only the dis-ease itself, but also its various forms. These limitations have to be taken into account dur-ing the process of results interpretation.

    "Abstract": "The biological role of miR-500a-5p has not yet been reported in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we show that miR-500a-5p expression is decreased in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Low miR-500a-5p expression is associated with malignant progression. Moreover, transfection of CRC cells with miR-500a-5p induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibits their growth and migration. Mechanistically, miR-500a-5p directly targets HDAC2 and inhibits HDAC2-mediated proliferation in CRC in nude mice. Furthermore, YY1 binds to the promoter of miR-500a-5p and negatively regulates its transcription. Restoration of miR-500a-5p expression is up-regulated via the p300/YY1/HDAC2 complex. Besides, therapeutic delivery of miR-500a-5p significantly suppresses tumour development in a xenograft tumour model and a HDAC2 inhibitor FK228-treated CRC model. Our studies demonstrate that miR-500a-5p functions as a tumour suppressor in CRC by targeting the p300/YY1/HDAC2 axis, which contributes to the development of and provides new potential candidates for CRC therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Elevated MYC expression sensitizes tumor cells to apoptosis but the therapeutic potential of this mechanism remains unclear. We find, in a model of MYC-driven breast cancer, that pharmacological activation of AMPK strongly synergizes with BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors to activate apoptosis. We demonstrate the translational potential of an AMPK and BCL-2/BCL-XL co-targeting strategy in ex vivo and in vivo models of MYC-high breast cancer. Metformin combined with navitoclax or venetoclax efficiently inhibited tumor growth, conferred survival benefits and induced tumor infiltration by immune cells. However, withdrawal of the drugs allowed tumor re-growth with presentation of PD-1+/CD8+ T cell infiltrates, suggesting immune escape. A two-step treatment regimen, beginning with neoadjuvant metformin+venetoclax to induce apoptosis and followed by adjuvant metformin+venetoclax+anti-PD-1 treatment to overcome immune escape, led to durable antitumor responses even after drug withdrawal. We demonstrate that pharmacological reactivation of MYC-dependent apoptosis is a powerful antitumor strategy involving both tumor cell depletion and immunosurveillance. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A high throughput histology (microTMA) platform was applied for testing drugs against tumors in a novel 3D heterotypic glioblastoma brain sphere (gBS) model consisting of glioblastoma tumor cells, iPSC-derived neurons, glial cells and astrocytes grown in a spheroid. The differential responses of gBS tumors and normal neuronal cells to sustained treatments with anti-cancer drugs temozolomide (TMZ) and doxorubicin (DOX) were investigated. gBS were exposed to TMZ or DOX over a 7-day period. Untreated gBS tumors increased in size over a 4-week culture period, however, there was no increase in the number of normal neuronal cells. TMZ (100 uM) and DOX (0.3 uM) treatments caused ~30% (P~0.07) and ~80% (P < 0.001) decreases in the size of the tumors, respectively. Neither treatment altered the number of normal neuronal cells in the model. The anti-tumor effects of TMZ and DOX were mediated in part by selective induction of apoptosis. This platform provides a novel approach for screening new anti-glioblastoma agents and evaluating different treatment options for a given patient. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cell surface antigen discovery is of great interest for biomedical research both for isolation of rare cell populations and therapeutic targeting. We developed a rapid, cost-effective, fully in vitro technology which facilities the simultaneous target discovery and human antibody generation on the surface of virtually any cell population of interest. We apply our technique to human colorectal cancer-initiating cells (CICs) and identify hundreds of unique human antibodies. We characterized the top three antibody candidates targeting these CICs and identify their protein targets as integrin α7 (ITGA7), HLA-A1 and integrin β6 (ITGB6). We demonstrate that these antibodies can be used to isolate self-renewing colorectal CICs, and that the integrin α7 antibody can prospectively identify glioblastoma brain tumor initiating cells as well as human muscle stem cells. We also demonstrate that genetic ablation of integrin β6 impedes colorectal CIC function. The methodology can be readily applied to other cell populations including stem cells, cancer, or immune cells to facilitate the rapid identification of novel targets and simultaneous generation of potent and specific antibodies with therapeutic potential. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the causative agent of gastric cancer, making it the only bacterium to be recognized as a Class I carcinogen by the World Health Organization. The virulence factor cytotoxin associated gene A (CagA) is a known oncoprotein that contributes to the development of gastric cancer. The other major virulence factor vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), disrupts endolysosomal vesicular trafficking and impairs the autophagy pathway. Studies indicate that there is a functional interplay between these virulence factors by unknown mechanisms. We show that in the absence of VacA, both host-cell autophagy and the proteasome degrade CagA during infection with H. pylori. In the presence of VacA, CagA accumulates in gastric epithelial cells. However, VacA does not affect proteasome function during infection with H. pylori suggesting that VacA−disrupted autophagy is the predominant means by which CagA accumulates. Our studies support a model where in the presence of VacA, CagA accumulates in dysfunctional autophagosomes providing a possible explanation for the functional interplay of VacA and CagA. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Although numerous therapeutic strategies have attempted to target aerobic glycolysis to inhibit tumor progression, these approaches have not resulted in effective clinical outcomes. Murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be initiated by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). HFSCs utilize aerobic glycolysis, and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) is essential for HFSC activation. We sought to determine whether Ldh activity in SCC is critical for tumorigenesis or simply a marker of the cell type of origin. Genetic abrogation or induction of Ldh activity in HFSC-mediated tumorigenesis shows no effect on tumorigenesis as measured by number, time to formation, proliferation, volume, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, gene expression, or immune response. Ldha-null tumors show dramatically reduced levels of glycolytic metabolites by metabolomics, and significantly reduced glucose uptake by FDG-PET live animal imaging. These results suggest that squamous cancer cells of origin do not require increased glycolytic activity to generate cancers. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The main interest of this study is the hypothesis that contact with small children may be beneficial for the parents’ later health and mortality (because of changes in their immune system). For this purpose, we document the relationship of a set of individual characteristics—including parenthood and marital state—and socioeconomic status with an individual’s cause of death. Using a novel and rich data set made available by the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS-LS), which follows 1% of the population of England and Wales along five census waves 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011, our competing risks analysis yields several striking results: (1) Females with children have a 72.5% reduced risk of dying of cancer compared to childless females (for childless females of age 70, this corresponds to a risk of dying of cancer of 1.3% compared to a risk of about 1.3 × 0.275 = 0.4% for females with children). (2) Males have a 171% increased chance of dying of cancer when they are married (e.g., a baseline probability of 1.2% when 75 year old) compared to unmarried males. (3) Females with children have only a 34% risk of dying of heart disease (corresponding to a conditional probability of 0.3% when aged 65) relative to females without children and (4) a 53% chance of dying of infections (i.e., 0.1% at 65 years of age) compared to the risk for females without children. (5) At the same age, married men have an increased expectation of 123% of dying of heart disease (corresponding to an expected death probability of 0.7%) compared to unmarried men. (6) High income and house ownership is always associated with higher survival but less so than having children. While these results document a relationship between the presence of children and mortality, the specific transmission mechanisms remain unclear and we cannot make causality assertions. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cisplatin is an extensively used chemotherapeutic drug for lung cancer, but the development of resistance decreases its effectiveness in the treatments of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we examined the effects of metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, on cisplatin radiosensitization in NSCLC cell lines. Human NSCLC cell lines, A549 (cisplatin-resistant) and H460 (cisplatin-sensitive), were treated with metformin, cisplatin or a combination of both drugs before ionizing radiation. Cell proliferation, clonogenic assays, western blotting, cisplatin-DNA adduct formation and immunocytochemistry were used to characterize the treatments effects. Metformin increased the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. Metformin showed additive and over-additive effects in combination with cisplatin and the radiation response in the clonogenic assay in H460 and A549 cell lines (p = 0.018 for the interaction effect between cisplatin and metformin), respectively. At the molecular level, metformin led to a significant increase in cisplatin-DNA adduct formation compared with cisplatin alone (p < 0.01, ANOVA-F test). This was accompanied by a decreased expression of the excision repair cross-complementation 1 expression (ERCC1), a key enzyme in nucleotide excision repair pathway. Furthermore, compared with each treatment alone metformin in combination with cisplatin yielded the lowest level of radiation-induced Rad51 foci, an essential protein of homologous recombination repair. Ionizing radiation-induced γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci persisted longer in both cell lines in the presence of metformin. Pharmacological inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) demonstrated that metformin enhances the radiosensitizing effect of cisplatin through an AMPK-dependent pathway only in H460 but not in A549 cells. Our results suggest that metformin can enhance the effect of combined cisplatin and radiotherapy in NSCLC and can sensitize these cells to radiation that are not sensitized by cisplatin alone. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are of great interest in cancer research, but methods for their enumeration remain far from optimal. We developed a new small animal research tool called “Diffuse in vivo Flow Cytometry” (DiFC) for detecting extremely rare fluorescently-labeled circulating cells directly in the bloodstream. The technique exploits near-infrared diffuse photons to detect and count cells flowing in large superficial arteries and veins without drawing blood samples. DiFC uses custom-designed, dual fiber optic probes that are placed in contact with the skin surface approximately above a major vascular bundle. In combination with a novel signal processing algorithm, DiFC allows counting of individual cells moving in arterial or venous directions, as well as measurement of their speed and depth. We show that DiFC allows sampling of the entire circulating blood volume of a mouse in under 10 minutes, while maintaining a false alarm rate of 0.014 per minute. In practice, this means that DiFC allows reliable detection of circulating cells below 1 cell per mL. Hence, the unique capabilities of DiFC are highly suited to biological applications involving very rare cell types such as the study of hematogenous cancer metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "p-Cresyl sulfate (pCS), a uremic toxin, can cause renal damage and dysfunction. Studies suggest that renal dysfunction increases the prevalence of renal cancer. However, the effect of pCS on the proliferation and migration of renal cancer is unclear. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) expresses mutant von Hippel-Lindau gene and is difficult to treat. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and 2-α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) as well as microRNA-21 (miR-21) can regulate the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells. However, the association between HIF-α and miR-21 in ccRCC remains unclear. Therefore, the effects of pCS on ccRCC cells were investigated for HIF-α and miR-21 signals. Our results showed that pCS induced overexpression of HIF-1α and promoted the proliferation and regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins, including E-cadherin, fibronectin, twist and vimentin in ccRCC cells. pCS treatment increased miR-21 expression. Specifically, inhibition of miR-21 blocked pCS-induced proliferation and migration. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that pCS directly induced the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells through mechanisms involving miR-21/HIF-1α signaling pathways. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Deficiencies in DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair (MMR), have been linked to higher tumor mutation burden and improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the significance of MMR mutations in lung cancer has not been well characterized, and the relevance of other processes, including homologous recombination (HR) and polymerase epsilon (POLE) activity, remains unclear. Here, we analyzed a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Variants in DNA repair genes were associated with increased tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, which in turn were linked with greater tumor infiltration by activated T cells. The subset of tumors with DNA repair gene variants but without T cell infiltration exhibited upregulation of TGF-β and Wnt pathway genes, and a combined score incorporating these genes and DNA repair status accurately predicted immune cell infiltration. Finally, high neoantigen burden was positively associated with genes related to cytolytic activity and immune checkpoints. These findings provide evidence that DNA repair pathway defects and immunomodulatory genes together lead to specific immunophenotypes in lung squamous cell carcinoma and could potentially serve as biomarkers for immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Treatment of gastric cancer (GC) often produces poor outcomes. Moreover, predicting which GC treatments will be effective remains challenging. Computational drug repositioning using public databases is a promising and efficient tool for discovering new uses for existing drugs. Here we used a computational reversal of gene expression approach based on effects on gene expression signatures by GC disease and drugs to explore new GC drug candidates. Gene expression profiles for individual GC tumoral and normal gastric tissue samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC were determined with a meta-signature analysis. Profiles drug activity and drug-induced gene expression were downloaded from the ChEMBL and the LINCS databases, respectively. Candidate drugs to treat GC were predicted using reversal gene expression score (RGES). Drug candidates including sorafenib, olaparib, elesclomol, tanespimycin, selumetinib, and ponatinib were predicted to be active for treatment of GC. Meanwhile, GC-related genes such as PLOD3, COL4A1, UBE2C, MIF, and PRPF5 were identified as having gene expression profiles that can be reversed by drugs. These findings support the use of a computational reversal gene expression approach to identify new drug candidates that can be used to treat GC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis, which is mainly due to late diagnosis and profound resistance to treatment. The latter is to a large extent attributed to the tumor stroma that is exceedingly prominent in PDAC and engages in complex interactions with the cancer cells. Hence, relevant preclinical models of PDAC should also include the tumor stroma. We herein describe the establishment and functional validation of an ex vivo organotypic culture of human PDAC that is based on precision-cut tissue slices from surgical specimens and reproducibly recapitulates the complex cellular and acellular composition of PDAC, including its microenvironment. The cancer cells, tumor microenvironment and interspersed remnants of nonneoplastic pancreas contained in these 350 µm thick slices maintained their structural integrity, phenotypic characteristics and functional activity when in culture for at least 4 days. In particular, tumor cell proliferation persisted and the grade of differentiation and morphological phenotype remained unaltered. Cultured tissue slices were metabolically active and responsive to rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. This culture system is to date the closest surrogate to the parent carcinoma and harbors great potential as a drug sensitivity testing system for the personalized treatment of PDAC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is progressively increasing tumor with lack of accurate prognosis and inadequate systemic treatment approaches. Solanum sp. (such as Solanum melongena) is a folk herb which is reported to possess anticancer properties. In a continuity for our interest in pursuing the anticancer activity of compounds isolated from the fruit peels of Solanum melongena, the HPLC profiling and ESI-MS assessment for the methanolic extract evidenced the presence of bioactive glycoalkaloids (solasonine, solasodine and solamargine). These glycoalkaloids were isolated, purified and proved to possess in vitro cytotoxicity against human liver cancer cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2). Herein, we investigated the potential mechanism of action of these compounds using DNA content flow-cytometry and apoptosis/necrosis differential anaylsis using annexin-V/FITC staining. Solasonine, solasodine and solamargine inducd significant antiproliferative effect against liver cancer cells (Huh7 and HepG2) which was attributed to cell cycle arrest at S-phase. Solamargine, solasodine and solasonine induced significant apoptosis in Huh7 cells. Only solamargine-induced cell cycle arrest, was reflected as apoptotic cell killing effect against HepG2 cells. In conclusion, glycoalkaloids derived from Solanum melongena and particularly, solamargine are promising antiproliferative agents with potential anticancer effects. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The objectives of this study were to assess the associations among various physical and mental chronic conditions and napping. A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was proposed within the NutriNet-Santé population-based e-cohort launched in France in 2009. Participants were 43,060 French volunteers aged 18 y and over with Internet access. A self-report questionnaire assessing sleep characteristics was administered in 2014. The main outcome (dependent) variable was weekday or weekend napping (yes/no). The main exposure (independent) variables were overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety and depressive disorders, incident major cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina), and incident cancer (breast and prostate). The associations of interest were investigated with multivariable logistic regression analysis. No significant associations were found between major cardiovascular diseases or breast or prostate cancer and napping. Instead, we found that napping was more common among males (46.1%) than among females 36.9% (p < 0.0001). Individuals who were overweight or obese or had hypertension, diabetes, depression or anxiety disorders had an increased likelihood of napping compared with their healthy peers. The adjusted ORs ranged from 1.14 to 1.28″. In conclusion, most chronic conditions were independently associated with napping. Future longitudinal analyses are needed to elucidate causality. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Translation is a highly regulated process that is perturbed in human cancers, often through activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway which impacts directly on the ribosome recruitment phase of translation initiation. While significant research has focused on “drugging” components of the PI3K/mTOR network, efforts have also been directed towards inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F-dependent translation. Small molecule inhibitors of this complex have been identified, characterized, and used to validate the rationale of targeting this step to curtail tumor cell growth and modulate chemotherapy response. One such class of compounds are the rocaglates, secondary metabolites from the plant genus Aglaia, which target the RNA helicase subunit of eIF4F, eIF4A. Here we explore the ability of synthetic derivatives of aglaiastatins and an aglaroxin derivative to target the translation process in vitro and in vivo and find the synthetic derivative oxo-aglaiastatin to possess such activity. Oxo-aglaiastatin inhibited translation in vitro and in vivo and synergized with doxorubicin, ABT-199 (a Bcl-2 antagonist), and dexamethasone when tested on hematological cancer cells. The biological activity of oxo-aglaiastatin was shown to be a consequence of inhibiting eIF4A1 activity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Alumina is one of the most promising carriers for drug delivery due to the long history of its usage as a vaccine adjuvant. Sol-gel synthesis provides excellent conditions for entrapment of biomolecules within an inorganic cage providing stabilization of proteins under the extremal conditions. In this paper, we show in vitro investigation of monodisperse alumina xerogel nanocontainers (AXNCs) using bovine serum albumin as a model protein entrapped in sol-gel alumina building blocks. Particularly, dose and cell-type dependent cytotoxicity in HeLa and A549 cancer cell lines were employed as well as investigation of antibacterial effect and stability of AXNCs in different biological media. It was shown, that the release of entrapped protein could be provided only in low pH buffer (as in cancer cell cytoplasm). This property could be applied for anticancer drug development. We also discovered boehmite nanoparticles effect on horizontal gene transfer and observed the appearance of antibiotic resistance by means of exchanging of the corresponding plasmid between two different E. coli strains. The present work may help to understand better the influence of AXNCs on various biological systems, such as prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and the activity of AXNCs in different biological media. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A green and simple process for preparing the polyethylene glycol passivated fluorescent carbon dots (CDs-PEG) have been studied by a microwave pyrolysis method, using gelatin and PEG as starting materials. This method is very effective for development of carbon-based quantum dots from gelatin with high quantum yield (QY). The synthesized CDs-PEG were found to emit blue photoluminescence (PL) with a maximum QY of 34%. At the following research, we investigated the effect of the presence of PEG on PL intensity, and the result showed that CDs-PEG becomes stronger PL properties than pure CDs from gelatin. The synthesized CDs-PEG were characterized by FTIR, TEM, UV-vis, PL, zeta potential and XRD analyses. The anticancer performance of developed CDs-PEG was evaluated by in vitro tests such as MTT assay and fluorescence microscopy analyses. The examination of CDs-PEG as an anti-cancer drug nanocarrier for methotrexate (MTX) illustrated a better antitumor efficacy than free MTX due to its enhanced nuclear delivery in vitro, which resulting in highly effective tumour growth inhibition and improving targeted cancer therapy in clinical medicine.",

    "Abstract": "Histone demethylase KDM5A removes methyl marks from lysine 4 of histone H3 and is often overexpressed in cancer. The in vitro demethylase activity of KDM5A is allosterically enhanced by binding of its product, unmodified H3 peptides, to its PHD1 reader domain. However, the molecular basis of this allosteric enhancement is unclear. Here we show that saturation of the PHD1 domain by the H3 N-terminal tail peptides stabilizes binding of the substrate to the catalytic domain and improves the catalytic efficiency of demethylation. When present in saturating concentrations, differently modified H3 N-terminal tail peptides have a similar effect on demethylation. However, they vary greatly in their affinity towards the PHD1 domain, suggesting that H3 modifications can tune KDM5A activity. Furthermore, hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments reveal conformational changes in the allosterically enhanced state. Our findings may enable future development of anti-cancer therapies targeting regions involved in allosteric regulation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "δ-Catenin shares common binding partners with β-catenin. As acetylation and deacetylation regulate β-catenin stability, we searched for histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs) affecting δ-catenin acetylation status and protein levels. We showed that p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) directly bound to and acetylated δ-catenin, whereas several class I and class II HDACs reversed this effect. Unlike β-catenin, δ-catenin was downregulated by PCAF-mediated acetylation and upregulated by HDAC-mediated deacetylation. The HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A attenuated HDAC1-mediated δ-catenin upregulation, whereas HAT or autophagy inhibitors, but not proteasome inhibitors, abolished PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation. The results suggested that PCAF-mediated δ-catenin acetylation promotes its autophagic degradation in an Atg5/LC3-dependent manner. Deletions or point mutations identified several lysine residues in different δ-catenin domains involved in PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation. PCAF overexpression in prostate cancer cells markedly reduced δ-catenin levels and suppressed cell growth and motility. PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation inhibited E-cadherin processing and decreased the nuclear distribution of β-catenin, resulting in the suppression of β-catenin/LEF-1-mediated downstream effectors. These data demonstrate that PCAF downregulates δ-catenin by promoting its autophagic degradation and suppresses δ-catenin-mediated oncogenic signals. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Genetically deregulated tumor cells generate vascular channels by vasculogenic mimicry (VM) that is independent of endothelial blood vessels. The morphological characteristics of VM and the role of EphA2 in the formation of VM were evaluated in 144 clinical samples of gastric adenocarcinoma and AGS gastric cancer cell line. It has long been believed that VM consists of PAS-positive basement membrane and CD31/CD34-negative cells. Interestingly, we found that the luminal surface of gastric tumor cells that form VM channels showed PAS-positive reaction, and that the involvement of CD31/CD34-positive tumor cells in the formation of VM channels. Highly aggressive tumor cells that formed VM were found to express CD31 or CD34, implicating the angiogenic and vasculogenic potential of the genetically deregulated tumor cells. VM occurrence was positively correlated with high expression of EphA2 in our patient cohort, and the indispensable role of EphA2 in VM formation was identified by gene silencing in AGS cells. We also report that Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive tumor cells were involved in the formation of VM channels in EBV-associated gastric cancer samples. Overall, our results suggest that EphA2 signaling promotes tumor metastasis by inducing VM formation during gastric tumorigenesis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumors bearing homologous recombination deficiency are extremely sensitive to DNA double strand breaks induced by several chemotherapeutic agents. ATM gene, encoding a protein involved in DNA damage response, is frequently mutated in colorectal cancer (CRC), but its potential role as predictive and prognostic biomarker has not been fully investigated. We carried out a multicenter effort aimed at defining the prognostic impact of ATM mutational status in metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients. Mutational profiles were obtained by means of next-generation sequencing. Overall, 35 out of 227 samples (15%) carried an ATM mutation. At a median follow-up of 56.6 months, patients with ATM mutated tumors showed a significantly longer median overall survival (OS) versus ATM wild-type ones (64.9 vs 34.8 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29–0.85; P = 0.01). In the multivariable model, ATM mutations confirmed the association with longer OS (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33–0.98; P = 0.04). The prognostic impact of ATM mutations was independent from TP53 mutational status and primary tumor location. High heterogeneity score for ATM mutations, possibly reflecting the loss of wild-type allele, was associated with excellent prognosis. In conclusion, we showed that ATM mutations are independently associated with longer OS in patients with mCRC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) protects against potentially damaging events, such as excessive generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). We investigated the contribution of the two major MQC processes, namely, mitophagy and Mieap-induced accumulation of lysosomes within mitochondria (MALM), to the response to hypoxia of two human gastric cancer (GC) cell lines. We found that hypoxia increased mtROS generation and cell invasion in 58As9, but not in MKN45, although the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α was induced in both cell lines. Colocalisation of lysosomes with mitochondria was found only in hypoxic MKN45 cells, suggesting that hypoxia-induced MQC functions normally in MKN45 but may be impaired in 58As9. Hypoxia did not lead to decreased mitochondrial mass or DNA or altered appearance of autophagosomes, as judged by electron microscopy, suggesting that mitophagy was not induced in either cell line. However, western blot analysis revealed the presence of the MALM-associated proteins Mieap, BNIP3 and BNIP3L, and the lysosomal protein cathepsin D in the mitochondrial fraction of MKN45 cells under hypoxia. Finally, Mieap knockdown in MKN45 cells resulted in increased mtROS accumulation and cell invasion under hypoxia. Our results suggest that hypoxia-induced MALM suppresses GC cell invasion by preventing mtROS generation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Imatinib is an oral chemotherapeutic used primarily to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The potential effects of cancer treatments on a patient’s future fertility are a major concern affecting the quality of life for cancer survivors. The effects of imatinib on future fertility are unknown. It is teratogenic. Therefore, patients are advised to stop treatment before pregnancy. Unfortunately, CML and GIST have high rates of recurrence in the absence of the drug, therefore halting imatinib during pregnancy endangers the mother. Possible long-term (post-treatment) effects of imatinib on reproduction have not been studied. We have used a mouse model to examine the effects of imatinib on the placenta and implantation after long-term imatinib exposure. We found significant changes in epigenetic markers of key imprinted genes in the placenta. There was a significant decrease in the labyrinth zone and vasculature of the placenta, which could impact fetal growth later in pregnancy. These effects on placental growth occurred even when imatinib was stopped prior to pregnancy. These results indicate potential long-term effects of imatinib on pregnancy and implantation. A prolonged wash-out period prior to pregnancy or extra monitoring for possible placental insufficiency may be advisable. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Comprehensive genomic sequencing (CGS) enables us to detect numerous genetic alterations in a single assay. We aimed to identify molecular markers for predicting prognosis and conversion surgery in Stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) using CGS. One-hundred eleven patients with Stage IV CRC who underwent primary tumor resection were analyzed. We retrospectively investigated genetic alterations using CGS of a 415-gene panel. Clinicopathological variables and genetic alterations were analyzed to identify independent prognostic factors of overall survival (OS). Forty-five of 111 patients had R0 resection; of these, 11 patients underwent conversion surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified histopathological grade 3, R0 resection, BRAF V600E mutation, and SRC mutation as independent prognostic factors for OS (P = 0.041, P = 0.013, P = 0.005, and P = 0.023, respectively). BRAF V600E and SRC mutations were mutually exclusive, and SRC mutation was significantly associated with left-sided tumor and liver metastasis compared to BRAF V600E mutation (P = 0.016 and P = 0.025, respectively). Eleven of the 74 initially unresectable patients underwent conversion surgery for R0 resection, yet none harbored BRAF V600E or SRC mutations. BRAF V600E and SRC mutations are important molecular markers which can predict prognosis and conversion surgery in Stage IV CRC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an important role in the protection against intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer (CRC); however, human data are scarce. We determined members of the ECS and related components of the ‘endocannabinoidome’ in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and CRC, and compared them to control subjects. Anandamide (AEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) were increased in plasma of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) patients while 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) was elevated in patients with CD, but not UC. 2-AG, but not AEA, PEA and OEA, was elevated in CRC patients. Lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) 18:0 showed higher levels in patients with IBD than in control subjects whereas LPI 20:4 was elevated in both CRC and IBD. Gene expression in intestinal mucosal biopsies revealed different profiles in CD and UC. CD, but not UC patients, showed increased gene expression for the 2-AG synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase alpha. Transcripts of CNR1 and GPR119 were predominantly decreased in CD. Our data show altered plasma levels of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like lipids in IBD and CRC and distinct transcript profiles in UC and CD. We also report alterations for less known components in intestinal inflammation, such as GPR119, OEA and LPI. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumors are not static masses of cells but dynamic ecosystems where cancer cells experience constant turnover and evolve fitness-enhancing phenotypes. Selection for different phenotypes may vary with (1) the tumor niche (edge or core), (2) cell turnover rates, (3) the nature of the tradeoff between traits, and (4) whether deaths occur in response to demographic or environmental stochasticity. Using a spatially-explicit agent-based model, we observe how two traits (proliferation rate and migration speed) evolve under different tradeoff conditions with different turnover rates. Migration rate is favored over proliferation at the tumor’s edge and vice-versa for the interior. Increasing cell turnover rates slightly slows tumor growth but accelerates the rate of evolution for both proliferation and migration. The absence of a tradeoff favors ever higher values for proliferation and migration, while a convex tradeoff tends to favor proliferation, often promoting the coexistence of a generalist and specialist phenotype. A concave tradeoff favors migration at low death rates, but switches to proliferation at higher death rates. Mortality via demographic stochasticity favors proliferation, and environmental stochasticity favors migration. While all of these diverse factors contribute to the ecology, heterogeneity, and evolution of a tumor, their effects may be predictable and empirically accessible. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is associated with a frequent loss in ARID1A function. ARID1A reportedly suppresses histone deacetylase (HDAC)6 in OCCC directly. Here, we evaluated the clinical significance of HDAC6 expression and its related factors in terms of ARID1A status. Immunohistochemical expression of HDAC6, hypoxia inducible factors-1α (HIF-1α), programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), CD44 (cancer stem cell marker), and ARID1A was analysed for 106 OCCC patients. High nuclear HDAC6 expression correlated with patient death (p = 0.038). In the multivariate analysis of overall survival, surgical status (complete or incomplete resection) (hazard ratio (HR) = 17.5; p = <0.001), HDAC6 nuclear expression (HR = 1.68; p = 0.034), and PD-L1 expression (HR = 1.95; p = 0.022) were the independent prognostic factors. HDAC6 upregulation and ARID1A loss did not necessarily occur simultaneously. High HDAC6 expression was associated with poor prognosis in OCCC with ARID1A loss; this was not observed without ARID1A loss. HDAC6 expression showed a significant positive correlation with HIF-1α, PD-L1, and CD44. In OCCC, HDAC6 involvement in prognosis depended on ARID1A status. HDAC6 also led to immuno- and hypoxia- tolerance and cancer stem cell phenotype. HDAC6 is a promising therapeutic target for OCCC with loss of ARID1A. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metformin, an inexpensive, well-tolerated oral agent that is a commonly used first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, has become the focus of intense research as a potential anticancer agent. In this study, we describe the inhibitory effect of metformin in interleukin 8 (IL-8) upregulation by lithocholic acid (LCA) in HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological inhibition studies indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in LCA-induced IL-8 upregulation through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Metformin was demonstrated to block LCA-stimulated ROS production, in turn suppressing NF-κB signaling that was critical for IL-8 upregulation. An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. In conclusion, metformin inhibited NADPH oxidase, which in turn suppressed ROS production and NF-κB activation to prevent IL-8 upregulation stimulated by LCA; this prevention thus obstructed endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) becomes a unique anti-cancer drug target as its overexpression is responsible for different types of cancers. In quest of novel, effective MARK4 inhibitors, some acridone derivatives were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for inhibitory activity against human MARK4. Among all the synthesized compounds, three (7b, 7d and 7f) were found to have better binding affinity and enzyme inhibition activity in µM range as shown by fluorescence binding, ITC and kinase assays. Here we used functional assays of selected potential lead molecules with commercially available panel of 26 kinases of same family. A distinctive kinase selectivity profile was observed for each compound. The selective compounds were identified with submicromolar cellular activity against MARK4. Furthermore, in vitro antitumor evaluation against cancerous cells (MCF-7 and HepG2) revealed that compounds 7b, 7d and 7f inhibit cell proliferation and predominantly induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, with IC 50 values of 5.2 ± 1.2 μM, 6.3 ± 1.2 μM, and 5.8 ± 1.4 μM respectively. In addition, these compounds significantly upsurge the oxidative stress in cancerous cells. Our observations support our approach for the synthesis of effective inhibitors against MARK4 that can be taken forward for the development of novel anticancer molecules targeting MARK4. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ammonia can be utilised as an alternative nitrogen source to glutamine to support cell proliferation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and whether all cells have this ability is not fully understood. We find that eleven cancer and non-cancerous cell lines have opposite abilities to tolerate and utilise ammonia to support proliferation in a glutamine-depleted environment. HEK293, Huh7, T47D and MCF7 cells can use ammonia, when starved of glutamine, to support proliferation to varying degrees. Glutamine depletion reduced mTORC1 activity, while additional ammonia supplementation diminished this mTORC1 inhibition. Depletion of glutamine promoted a rapid and transient activation of AMPK, whereas, additional ammonia supplementation blocked this starvation-induced AMPK activation. As expected, drug-induced AMPK activation reduced cell proliferation in glutamine-depleted cells supplemented with ammonia. Surprisingly, mTORC1 activity was largely unchanged despite the enhanced AMPK activity, suggesting that AMPK does not inhibit mTORC1 signalling under these conditions. Finally, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) inhibition, a key enzyme regulating ammonia assimilation, leads to AMPK activation, mTORC1 inhibition and reduced proliferation. Ammonia provides an alternative nitrogen source that aids certain cancer cells ability to thrive in nutrient-deprived environment. The ability of cells to utilise ammonia as a nitrogen source is intricately linked to AMPK, mTORC1 and GDH. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In the last years it has been shown that many components of tumor microenvironment (TM) can induce cell signaling that permit to breast cancer cells (BC) to maintain their aggressiveness. Ion channels have a role in mediating TM signal; recently we have demonstrated a functional collaboration between Kv10.1 and Orai1 channels in mediating the pro-survival effect of collagen 1 on BC cells. Here we show how SPCA2 (Secretory Pathway Ca2+ ATPase) has a role in this process and is able to support survival and proliferation induced by collagen 1. By participating to an auto-sustaining loop, SPCA2 enhances membrane expression of Kv10.1 and Orai1; the activity of every component of this trio is necessary to mediate a store independent calcium entry (SICE). This SICE is fundamental to maintain both the activation of the pro-survival pathway and the membrane localization and consequently the activity of the two channels. Moreover, the three proteins and the collagen receptor DDR1 are overexpressed only in aggressive tumors tissues. In this work, we propose a novel association between SPCA2, Kv10.1 and Orai1 involved in mediating transduction signals from TM to the BC cells that can be potentially exploited in the search of novel therapeutic targets specific to tumor tissues. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "PrimPol is a human primase/polymerase specialized in re-starting stalled forks by repriming beyond lesions such as pyrimidine dimers, and replication-perturbing structures including G-quadruplexes and R-loops. Unlike most conventional primases, PrimPol proficiently discriminates against ribonucleotides (NTPs), being able to start synthesis using deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), yet the structural basis and physiological implications for this discrimination are not understood. In silico analyses based on the three-dimensional structure of human PrimPol and related enzymes enabled us to predict a single residue, Tyr 100 , as the main effector of sugar discrimination in human PrimPol and a change of Tyr 100 to histidine to boost the efficiency of NTP incorporation. We show here that the Y100H mutation profoundly stimulates NTP incorporation by human PrimPol, with an efficiency similar to that for dNTP incorporation during both primase and polymerase reactions in vitro. As expected from the higher cellular concentration of NTPs relative to dNTPs, Y100H expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and U2OS osteosarcoma cells caused enhanced resistance to hydroxyurea, which decreases the dNTP pool levels in S-phase. Remarkably, the Y100H PrimPol mutation has been identified in cancer, suggesting that this mutation could be selected to promote survival at early stages of tumorigenesis, which is characterized by depleted dNTP pools. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Apart from offering insight into the biomechanisms involved in cancer, many recent mathematical modeling efforts aspire to the ultimate goal of clinical translation, wherein models are designed to be used in the future as clinical decision support systems in the patient-individualized context. Most significant challenges are the integration of multiscale biodata and the patient-specific model parameterization. A central aim of this study was the design of a clinically-relevant parameterization methodology for a patient-specific computational model of cervical cancer response to radiotherapy treatment with concomitant cisplatin, built around a tumour features-based search of the parameter space. Additionally, a methodological framework for the predictive use of the model was designed, including a scoring method to quantitatively reflect the similarity and bilateral predictive ability of any two tumours in terms of their regression profile. The methodology was applied to the datasets of eight patients. Tumour scenarios in accordance with the available longitudinal data have been determined. Predictive investigations identified three patient cases, anyone of which can be used to predict the volumetric evolution throughout therapy of the tumours of the other two with very good results. Our observations show that the presented approach is promising in quantifiably differentiating tumours with distinct regression profiles. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "L-γ-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (GPNA) is widely used to inhibit the glutamine (Gln) transporter ASCT2, but recent studies have demonstrated that it is also able to inhibit other sodium-dependent and independent amino acid transporters. Moreover, GPNA is a well known substrate of the enzyme γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Our aim was to evaluate the effect of GGT-mediated GPNA catabolism on cell viability and Gln transport. The GGT-catalyzed hydrolysis of GPNA produced cytotoxic effects in lung cancer A549 cells, resulting from the release of metabolite p-nitroaniline (PNA) rather than from the inhibition of Gln uptake. Interestingly, compounds like valproic acid, verapamil and reversan were able to increase the cytotoxicity of GPNA and PNA, suggesting a key role of intracellular detoxification mechanisms. Our data indicate that the mechanism of action of GPNA is more complex than believed, and further confirm the poor specificity of GPNA as an inhibitor of Gln transport. Different factors may modulate the final effects of GPNA, ranging from GGT and ASCT2 expression to intracellular defenses against xenobiotics. Thus, other strategies - such as a genetic suppression of ASCT2 or the identification of new specific inhibitors - should be preferred when inhibition of ASCT2 function is required. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Given the importance of gland morphology in grading prostate cancer (PCa), automatically differentiating between epithelium and other tissues is an important prerequisite for the development of automated methods for detecting PCa. We propose a new deep learning method to segment epithelial tissue in digitised hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained prostatectomy slides using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as reference standard. We used IHC to create a precise and objective ground truth compared to manual outlining on H&E slides, especially in areas with high-grade PCa. 102 tissue sections were stained with H&E and subsequently restained with P63 and CK8/18 IHC markers to highlight epithelial structures. Afterwards each pair was co-registered. First, we trained a U-Net to segment epithelial structures in IHC using a subset of the IHC slides that were preprocessed with color deconvolution. Second, this network was applied to the remaining slides to create the reference standard used to train a second U-Net on H&E. Our system accurately segmented both intact glands and individual tumour epithelial cells. The generalisation capacity of our system is shown using an independent external dataset from a different centre. We envision this segmentation as the first part of a fully automated prostate cancer grading pipeline. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Extra-transitional zone density (ETzD), a novel parameter is proposed to stratify the deviation of prostate specific antigen (PSA) due to structural change according to stromal hyperplasia of prostate. ETzD was conducted on a concept to estimate the PSA density (PSAD) after hypothetical enucleation of the transitional zone of an enlarged prostate by a non-linear regression prediction model with intrinsic linearity, from the retrospective analysis of PSA change observed actual enucleation by laser. The performance to predict the presence and severity of malignancy was validated by two cohorts of 3,440 prostate biopsies and 2,783 radical prostatectomy specimens. The performance of ETzD was compared with conventional parameters. The receiver operative curve of area under curve (AUC) of ETzD to predict the presence of malignacy was 0.862 (95% CI; 0.843~0.881), better than PSA, PSAD or transitional zone PSAD (TzPSAD). The AUC of ETzD to predict an unfavorable cancer among prostate cancer patients was 0.736 (95% CI; 0.705~0.768), which performs better than PSA and comparable to PSAD or TzPSAD. In summary, the performance of ETzD as a universal parameter to quantify the oncological hazard of a prostate was validated and the superiority to conventional parameters was verified. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Alterations in specific DNA damage repair mechanisms in the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection have been described in different experimental models. However, the global effect of HPV on the expression of genes involved in these pathways has not been analyzed in detail. In the present study, we compared the expression profile of 135 genes involved in DNA damage repair among primary human keratinocytes (PHK), HPV-positive (SiHa and HeLa) and HPV-negative (C33A) cervical cancer derived cell lines. We identified 9 genes which expression pattern distinguishes HPV-positive tumor cell lines from C33A. Moreover, we observed that Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1 (TREX1) expression is upregulated exclusively in HPV-transformed cell lines and PHK expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes. We demonstrated that TREX1 silencing greatly affects tumor cells clonogenic and anchorage independent growth potential. We showed that this effect is associated with p53 upregulation, accumulation of subG1 cells, and requires the expression of E7 from high-risk HPV types. Finally, we observed an increase in TREX1 levels in precancerous lesions, squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas clinical samples. Altogether, our results indicate that TREX1 upregulation is important for cervical tumor cells growth and may contribute with tumor establishment and progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The most frequently recurring cancer-associated DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) mutation is a P286R substitution in the exonuclease domain. While originally proposed to increase genome instability by disrupting exonucleolytic proofreading, the P286R variant was later found to be significantly more pathogenic than Pol ε proofreading deficiency per se. The mechanisms underlying its stronger impact remained unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of the yeast orthologue, Pol ε−P301R, complexed with DNA and an incoming dNTP. Structural changes in the protein are confined to the exonuclease domain, with R301 pointing towards the exonuclease site. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that R301 interferes with DNA binding to the exonuclease site, an outcome not observed with the exonuclease-inactive Pol ε−D290A,E292A variant lacking the catalytic residues. These results reveal a distinct mechanism of exonuclease inactivation by the P301R substitution and a likely basis for its dramatically higher mutagenic and tumorigenic effects. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor initiating cells (TIC) have been suggested as a mechanism for driving chemoresistance and tumor recurrence in human cancers including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Significant progress has been made in targeting TICs. However, methods for simultaneously targeting heterogeneous TIC populations are lacking. In this study, we found that treating TNBC cells with chemotherapeutic agents led to a significant accumulation of the ALDH + TIC population. Treating TNBC cells with a disulfiram and copper mixture (DSF/Cu) specifically decreased the ALDH + TIC population and treatment with BKM120, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, significantly decreased the CD44 + /CD24 − TIC population. Furthermore, treatment with DSF/Cu or BKM120 induced higher levels of apoptosis in ALDH + or CD44 + /CD24 − populations, respectively, than in bulk tumor cells. Combining DSF/Cu and BKM120 treatment simultaneously decreased the ALDH + and CD44 + /CD24 − TICs. Using a TNBC tumor xenograft mouse model, we found that DSF/BKM in combination with Taxol significantly reduced the tumor burden and delayed tumor recurrence compared to Taxol treatment alone. Our study is the first of its kind to use two different drugs to abolish two major TIC subtypes simultaneously and inhibit tumor recurrence. These results lay a foundation for developing a novel therapy that can improve chemotherapeutic efficacy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Autophagy is a cellular mechanism by which cells degrade intracellular components in lysosomes, maintaining cellular homeostasis. It has been hypothesized that autophagy could have a role in cancer prevention through the elimination of damaged proteins and organelles; this could explain epidemiological evidence showing the chemopreventive properties of the autophagy-inducer metformin. In this study, we analyzed the autophagy-related effect of metformin in both cancer initiation and progression in non-tumorigenic cells. We also analyzed the induction of tumorigenesis in autophagy-deficient cells, and its correlation with the ER stress. Our results showed that metformin induced massive cell death in preneoplastic JB6 Cl 41-5a cells treated with tumor promoter (phorbol) and in NIH/3T3 treated with H2O2. Inhibiting autophagy with wortmannin or ATG7 silencing, the effect of metformin decreased, indicating an autophagy-related cytotoxic activity under stress conditions. We also found an induction of tumorigenesis in ATG7-silenced NIH/3T3 cell clone (3T3-619C3 cells), but not in wild-type and in scrambled transfected cells, and an upregulation of unfolded protein response (UPR) markers in 3T3-619C3 cells treated with H2O2. These findings suggest that autophagic cell death could be considered as a new mechanism by which eliminate damaged cells, representing an attractive strategy to eliminate potential tumorigenic cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Our study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin (AP) with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (AG) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We collected data from two single-arm, phase II MBC studies. In NCT01149798, seventy-three MBC patients received 125 mg/m 2 nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8 and 15 followed by 75 mg/m 2 cisplatin on day 1 of a 28-day cycle. In NCT01550848, eighty-four MBC patients received 125 mg/m 2 nab-paclitaxel and 800 mg/m 2 gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety profiles of these regimens. Among the 157 patients included, the ORR were 67.1% and 52.4% for the AP and AG arms, respectively (odds ratio [OR] = 0.246; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.485; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.762–2.985). After median follow-up periods of 26.3 and 23.3 months in the AP and AG arms, the median PFS were 9.8 months (95%CI, 8.1–11.6) and 8.1 months (95%CI, 6.8–9.4), respectively, while the median OS were 26.9 months (95%CI, 22.4–31.4) and 25.5 months (95%CI, 19.3–31.4), respectively. Neither PFS nor OS adjusted for the number of metastases, occurrence of liver metastasis and chemotherapeutic lines differed significantly between the two arms (PFS:HR = 0.769; 95%CI, 0.541–1.092; p = 0.142; OS:HR = 0.686; 95%CI, 0.426–1.104; p = 0.120). However, PFS was significantly better with AP than with AG in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) patients (HR = 0.308; 95%CI, 0.129–0.732; p = 0.008). Adverse events were more common with AP than with AG, except for edema and myalgia. Both regimens showed substantial efficacy and were tolerated well in MBC patients. mTNBC who received AP rather than AG showed longer PFS. However, adverse events were more common with AP. Thus, AP may be worth recommending to mTNBC, while AG may be a better alternative for MBC patients with other subtypes. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Eupatorin has been reported with in vitro cytotoxic effect on several human cancer cells. However, reports on the mode of action and detail mechanism of eupatorin in vitro in breast cancer disease are limited. Hence, eupatorin’s effect on the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 was investigated. MTT assay showed that eupatorin had cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but was non-toxic to the normal cells of MCF-10a in a time-dose dependent manner. At 24 h, the eupatorin showed mild cytotoxicity on both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC 50 values higher than 20 μg/mL. After 48 h, eupatorin at 5 μg/mL inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by 50% while the IC 50 of MCF-10a was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) high with 30 μg/mL. The concentration of eupatorin at 5 μg/mL induced apoptosis mainly through intrinsic pathway by facilitating higher fold of caspase 9 compared to caspase 8 at 48 h. The cell cycle profile also showed that eupatorin (5 μg/mL) exerted anti-proliferation activity with the cell cycle arrest of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells at sub Gθ/G1 in a time-dependent manner. In addition, wound healing assay showed an incomplete wound closure of scratched MDA-MB-231 cells, and more than 60% of the MDA-MB-231 cells were prevented to migrate and invade the membrane in the Boyden chamber after 24 h. Eupatorin also inhibited angiogenic sprouting of new blood vessels in ex vivo mouse aorta ring assay. In gene expression assay, eupatorin up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes such as Bak1, HIF1A, Bax, Bad, cytochrome c and SMAC/Diablo and blocked the Phospho-Akt pathway. In conclusion, eupatorin is a potent candidate to induce apoptosis and concurrently inhibit the invasion, migration and angiogenesis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells through inhibition of Phospho-Akt pathway and cell cycle blockade. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Summary: Micronutrient and fat malabsorption and altered enteroendocrine signaling occur after esophagectomy for cancer; however, the impact of malnutrition on bone health in this cohort has not been previously investigated. In this study, the prevalence of osteoporosis increased after curative surgery, associated with disease-specific, treatment-related, and population risk factors. Purpose: Improved oncologic outcomes in esophageal cancer (EC) have resulted in increased survivorship and a focus on long-term quality of life. Malnutrition and micronutrient malabsorption are common among patients with EC, but the effect on bone metabolism is not known. The aim of this study was to characterize changes in bone mineral density (BMD) following curative esophagectomy. Methods: Consecutive disease-free patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit for pathologically node-negative disease from 2000 to 2014 were included. BMD was assessed at vertebral levels T12-L5 by computed tomography using a simple trabecular region-of-interest attenuation technique, and serum markers of nutritional status and bone metabolism were examined. Independent risk factors for osteoporosis were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Results: Seventy-five consecutive patients were studied. Osteoporosis was present in 25% at diagnosis. BMD declined at 1 and 2 years postoperatively (144.3 ± 45.8 versus 128.6 ± 46.2 and 122.7 ± 43.5 Hounsfield Units (HU), P < 0.0001), with increased osteoporosis prevalence to 38% and 44% (P = 0.049), respectively. No significant postoperative change in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate was observed, but alkaline phosphatase increased significantly (P < 0.001). While female sex (P = 0.004) and ASA grade (P = 0.043) were independently associated with osteoporosis at diagnosis, age (P = 0.050), female sex (P = 0.023), smoking (P = 0.024), and pathologic T stage (P = 0.023) were independently predictive of osteoporosis at 1 year postoperatively. Conclusions: Osteoporosis is prevalent among disease-free patients post-esophagectomy for EC, associated with disease-specific, treatment-related, and population risk factors. Strategies which minimize BMD decline should be considered to avoid fragility fractures in this cohort. © 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",

Here we present NeuSomatic, the first convolutional neural network approach for somatic mutation detection, which significantly outperforms previous methods on different sequencing platforms, sequencing strategies, and tumor purities. NeuSomatic summarizes sequence alignments into small matrices and incorporates more than a hundred features to capture mutation signals effectively. It can be used universally as a stand-alone somatic mutation detection method or with an ensemble of existing methods to achieve the highest accuracy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OV) is an extremely lethal disease. However, the evolutionary machineries of OV are still largely unknown. Here, we used a method that combines phylostratigraphy information with gene co-expression networks to extensively study the evolutionary compositions of OV. The present co-expression network construction yielded 18,549 nodes and 114,985 edges based on 307 OV expression samples obtained from the Genome Data Analysis Centers database. A total of 20 modules were identified as OV related clusters. The human genome sequences were divided into 19 phylostrata (PS), the majority (67.45%) of OV genes was already present in the eukaryotic ancestor. There were two strong peaks of the emergence of OV genes screened by hypergeometric test: the evolution of the multicellular metazoan organisms (PS5 and PS6, P value = 0.002) and the emergence of bony fish (PS11 and PS12, P value = 0.009). Hence, the origin of OV is far earlier than its emergence. The integrated analysis of the topology of OV modules and the phylogenetic data revealed an evolutionary pattern of OV in human, namely, OV modules have arisen step by step during the evolution of the respective lineages. New genes have evolved and become locked into a pathway, where more and more biological pathways are fixed into OV modules by recruiting new genes during human evolution. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cetuximab is a standard-of-care treatment for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) but not for those harbor a KRAS mutation since MAPK pathway is constitutively activated. Nevertheless, cetuximab also exerts its effect by its immunomodulatory activity despite the presence of RAS mutation. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of polymorphism FcγRIIIa V158F and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes on the outcome of mCRC patients with KRAS mutations treated with cetuximab. This multicenter Phase II clinical trial included 70 mCRC patients with KRAS mutated. We found KIR2DS4 gene was significantly associated with OS (HR 2.27; 95% CI, 1.08–4.77; P = 0.03). In non-functional receptor homozygotes the median OS was 2.6 months longer than in carriers of one copy of full receptor. Multivariate analysis confirmed KIR2DS4 as a favorable prognostic marker for OS (HR 6.71) in mCRC patients with KRAS mutation treated with cetuximab. These data support the potential therapeutic of cetuximab in KRAS mutated mCRC carrying non-functional receptor KIR2DS4 since these patients significantly prolong their OS even after heavily treatment. KIR2DS4 typing could be used as predictive marker for identifying RAS mutated patients that could benefit from combination approaches of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies and other immunotherapies to overcome the resistance mediated by mutation in RAS. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical impact of sarcopenia on the efficacy of programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitors. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab between January 2016 and September 2018 for previously treated advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on baseline computed tomography was assessed to calculate the psoas muscle index (PMI). Sarcopenia was defined based on PMI cut-off values for Asian adults (6.36 cm 2 /m 2 for males and 3.92 cm 2 /m 2 for females). A total of 42 patients were analysed. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 52.4%. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) (median, 2.1 vs. 6.8 months, p = 0.004). Compared to patients with sarcopenia, those without sarcopenia had a higher overall response rate (40.0% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.025) and 1-year PFS rate (38.1% vs. 10.1%). In conclusion, sarcopenia at baseline as determined using computed tomography is a significant predictor of worse outcome in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving PD-1 blockade. Screening for sarcopenia may help identify patients more likely to achieve a long-term response in routine clinical practice. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "If anastomotic site leakage is expected after laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR), de-functioning ileostomy is required. However, there is controversy about the consequence of stoma formation via the specimen extraction site (SES). Therefore, we aimed to investigate stoma-related complication according to stoma formation via the SES. We enrolled rectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic LAR with temporary ileostomy between January 2013 and December 2017. Patients were divided into two groups: stoma through the SES (SES) and stoma through a new site (NS). The difference in the incidence of stoma-related complications was analysed. In total, 198 patients underwent laparoscopic LAR (SES = 141 patients, NS = 57 patients). The SES group had a shorter operation time (204.7 ± 74.4 min vs 229.5 ± 90.5 min, p = 0.049) and was associated with fewer cases of wound infection (0% vs 7%, p = 0.006) than the NS group. There was no statistically significant difference between the SES group and NS group in all-stoma complications (22.7% vs 12.3%, p = 0.095). The incidence of parastomal hernia also was not significantly different (11.3% vs 5.3%, p = 0.286). Stoma via the SES is feasible after laparoscopic LAR with temporary ileostomy, although stoma-related complication rate was higher, without a significant difference. It can shorten the operation time and reduce wound infection rate. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) are the major therapeutics to treat cancer patients. Conventional in vitro 2D models are insufficient to study the combined effects of RT and CT towards optimized dose selection or drug screening. Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare cancers with profound social impacts as they affect patients of all ages. We developed a microfluidic device to form and culture STS spheroids to study the combined cytotoxicities of RT and CT. Uniformly-sized spheroids of two different cell lines, STS 93 and STS 117, were formed in the device. RT doses of 0.5 Gy, 2 Gy, and 8 Gy were used in combination with CT, doxorubicin at 2 µM and 20 µM. The spheroids culture chambers within the device were arranged in a 3 × 5 matrix form. The device was made “peelable”, which enabled us to collect spheroids from each treatment condition separately. Collected spheroids were dissociated into single cells and evaluated using flow cytometry and clonogenic assays. Through this workflow, we observed that STS 93 spheroids treated with doxorubicin die through apoptosis, whereas RT induced death through other pathways. Spheroids from the p53 mutant STS 117 cell line were more resistant to RT and doxorubicin. The developed device could be used for the discovery of new drugs and RT synergies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) bind to the 3ʹ-untranslated region of target mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner and subsequently repress gene translation. Human miR-26a has been studied extensively, but the target transcripts are far from complete. We first employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate an miR-26a-knockout line in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. The miR26a-knockout line showed increased cell growth and altered proliferation. Proteomics technology of sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) was utilized to compare the protein abundance between the wild-type and the knockout lines, with an attempt to identify transcripts whose translation was influenced by miR-26a. Functional classification of the proteins with significant changes revealed their function in stress response, proliferation, localization, development, signaling, etc. Several proteins in the cell cycle/proliferation signaling pathway were chosen to be validated by western blot and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). The satisfactory consistency among the three approaches indicated the reliability of the SWATH-MS quantification. Among the computationally predicted targets, a subset of the targets was directly regulated by miR-26a, as demonstrated by luciferase assays and Western blotting. This study creates an inventory of miR-26a-targeted transcripts in HeLa cells and provides fundamental knowledge to further explore the functions of miR-26a in human cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Microcalcifications are vital mammographic indicators contributing to the early detection of up to 50% of non-palpable tumours and may also be valuable as prognostic markers. However, the precise mechanism by which they form remains incompletely understood. Following development of an in vitro model using human breast cancer cells lines cultured with a combination of mineralisation-promoting reagents, analysis of calcium deposition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and changes in expression of key genes was used to monitor the calcification process. Two cell lines were identified as successfully mineralising in vitro, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3. Mineralising cell lines displayed higher levels of ALP activity that was further increased by addition of mineralisation promoting media. qPCR analysis revealed changes in expression of both pro- (RUNX2) and anti- (MGP, ENPP1) mineralisation genes. Mineralisation was suppressed by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ and inhibition of TRPM7, demonstrating a functional role for the channel in formation of microcalcifications. Increased Mg2+ was also found to effectively reduce calcium deposition. These results expand the number of human breast cancer cell lines with a demonstrated in vitro mineralisation capability, provide further evidence for the role of an active, cellular process of microcalcification formation and demonstrate for the first time a role for TRPM7 mediated Ca2+ transport. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "PCBs are classified as xenoestrogens and carcinogens and their health risks may be sex-specific. To identify potential sex-specific responses to PCB-exposure we established gene expression profiles in a population study subdivided into females and males. Gene expression profiles were determined in a study population consisting of 512 subjects from the EnviroGenomarkers project, 217 subjects who developed lymphoma and 295 controls were selected in later life. We ran linear mixed models in order to find associations between gene expression and exposure to PCBs, while correcting for confounders, in particular distribution of white blood cells (WBC), as well as random effects. The analysis was subdivided according to sex and development of lymphoma in later life. The changes in gene expression as a result of exposure to the six studied PCB congeners were sex- and WBC type specific. The relatively large number of genes that are significantly associated with PCB-exposure in the female subpopulation already indicates different biological response mechanisms to PCBs between the two sexes. The interaction analysis between different PCBs and WBCs provides only a small overlap between sexes. In males, cancer-related pathways and in females immune system-related pathways are identified in association with PCBs and WBCs. Future lymphoma cases and controls for both sexes show different responses to the interaction of PCBs with WBCs, suggesting a role of the immune system in PCB-related cancer development. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Preclinical studies demonstrated that radiation up-regulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, providing a rationale for combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with radiation. However this has not been validated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer due to the difficulty to obtain serial biopsies. Measuring PD-L1 expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may allow real-time monitoring of immune activation in tumor. In this study, whole blood from non-metastatic NSCLC patients was collected before, during, and after radiation or chemoradiation using a microfluidic chip. PD-L1 expression in CTCs was assessed by immunofluorescence and qPCR and monitored through the course of treatment. Overall, PD-L1(+) CTCs were detected in 25 out of 38 samples (69.4%) with an average of 4.5 cells/ml. After initiation of radiation therapy, the proportion of PD-L1(+) CTCs increased significantly (median 0.7% vs. 24.7%, P < 0.01), indicating up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells in response to radiation. In addition, patients positive for PD-L1 (≥5% of CTCs positive for PD-L1) at baseline had shorter PFS. Gene expression analysis revealed that higher levels of PD-L1 were associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, CTCs can be used to monitor dynamic changes of PD-L1 during radiation therapy which is potentially prognostic of response to treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "To analyze the level and diagnostic value of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in gastric cancer (GC) of Han and Uygur in Xinjiang, China, we collected 42 GC and 47 normal gastric tissues and performed tissue microarray. In situ hybridization was used to detect PVT1, while immunohistochemistry was used to analyze c-myc. The relationship between PVT1, c-myc and clinical pathological features was investigated. We then analyzed the expression of PVT1 in six GC cell lines. RNA interference was used to silence PVT1 in BGC823 and AGS cells. c-myc was detected by western blotting after silencing PVT1, while proliferation, invasion and migration ability were also analyzed. We found that PVT1 and c-myc were highly expressed in both Han and Uygur GC tissues. In Han GC, PVT1 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and primary tumor site. In Uygur GC, both PVT1 and c-myc were correlated with lymph node metastasis and clinical staging. PVT1 was positively correlated with c-myc. BGC823 and AGS cells exhibited high levels of PVT1. When PVT1 expression was silenced, the expression of c-myc decreased, while migration and invasion ability were also decreased in cells. PVT1 could therefore be a potential biomarker to predict the metastatic tendency of GC in both Han and Uygur patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Alterations in the exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase ε (Polε) cause ultramutated tumors. Severe mutator effects of the most common variant, Polε-P286R, modeled in yeast suggested that its pathogenicity involves yet unknown mechanisms beyond simple proofreading deficiency. We show that, despite producing a catastrophic amount of replication errors in vivo, the yeast Polε-P286R analog retains partial exonuclease activity and is more accurate than exonuclease-dead Polε. The major consequence of the arginine substitution is a dramatically increased DNA polymerase activity. This is manifested as a superior ability to copy synthetic and natural templates, extend mismatched primer termini, and bypass secondary DNA structures. We discuss a model wherein the cancer-associated substitution limits access of the 3’-terminus to the exonuclease site and promotes binding at the polymerase site, thus stimulating polymerization. We propose that the ultramutator effect results from increased polymerase activity amplifying the contribution of Polε errors to the genomic mutation rate. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We report a non-covalent loading of ginsenoside compound K (CK) onto our previously reported gold nanoparticles (DCY51T-AuCKNps) through one-pot biosynthesis using a probiotic Lactobacillus kimchicus DCY51T isolated from Korean kimchi. The ginsenoside-loaded gold nanoparticles were characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques such as field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, elemental mapping, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Furthermore, drug loading was also determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In addition, DCY51T-AuNps and DCY51T-AuCKNps were resistant to aggregation caused by pH variation or a high ionic strength environment. Cell-based study confirmed that DCY51T-AuCKNps exhibited slightly higher cytotoxicity compared to ginsenoside CK treatment in A549 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) and HT29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line). Upon laser treatment, DCY51T-AuCKNps showed enhanced cell apoptosis in A549, HT29 and AGS cells (human stomach gastric adenocarcinoma cell line) compared with only DCY51T-AuCKNps treated cells. In conclusion, this preliminary study identified that DCY51T-AuCKNps act as a potent photothermal therapy agents with synergistic chemotherapeutic effects for the treatment of cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Drugs that modify the epigenome are powerful tools for treating cancer, but these drugs often have pleiotropic effects, and identifying patients who will benefit from them remains a major clinical challenge. Here we show that medulloblastomas driven by the transcription factor Gfi1 are exquisitely dependent on the enzyme lysine demethylase 1 (Kdm1a/Lsd1). We demonstrate that Lsd1 physically associates with Gfi1, and that these proteins cooperate to inhibit genes involved in neuronal commitment and differentiation. We also show that Lsd1 is essential for Gfi1-mediated transformation: Gfi1 proteins that cannot recruit Lsd1 are unable to drive tumorigenesis, and genetic ablation of Lsd1 markedly impairs tumor growth in vivo. Finally, pharmacological inhibitors of Lsd1 potently inhibit growth of Gfi1-driven tumors. These studies provide important insight into the mechanisms by which Gfi1 contributes to tumorigenesis, and identify Lsd1 inhibitors as promising therapeutic agents for Gfi1-driven medulloblastoma. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Deregulation of the RAS GTPase cycle due to mutations in the three RAS genes is commonly associated with cancer development. Protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 promotes RAF-to-MAPK signaling pathway and is an essential factor in RAS-driven oncogenesis. Despite the emergence of SHP2 inhibitors for the treatment of cancers harbouring mutant KRAS, the mechanism underlying SHP2 activation of KRAS signaling remains unclear. Here we report tyrosyl-phosphorylation of endogenous RAS and demonstrate that KRAS phosphorylation via Src on Tyr32 and Tyr64 alters the conformation of switch I and II regions, which stalls multiple steps of the GTPase cycle and impairs binding to effectors. In contrast, SHP2 dephosphorylates KRAS, a process that is required to maintain dynamic canonical KRAS GTPase cycle. Notably, Src- and SHP2-mediated regulation of KRAS activity extends to oncogenic KRAS and the inhibition of SHP2 disrupts the phosphorylation cycle, shifting the equilibrium of the GTPase cycle towards the stalled ‘dark state’. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are known due to their mutagenic activity. Among them, 2-nitrobenzanthrone (2-NBA) and 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) are considered as two of the most potent mutagens found in atmospheric particles. In the present study 2-NBA, 3-NBA and selected PAHs and Nitro-PAHs were determined in fine particle samples (PM 2.5) collected in a bus station and an outdoor site. The fuel used by buses was a diesel-biodiesel (96:4) blend and light-duty vehicles run with any ethanol-to-gasoline proportion. The concentrations of 2-NBA and 3-NBA were, on average, under 14.8 µg g−1 and 4.39 µg g−1, respectively. In order to access the main sources and formation routes of these compounds, we performed ternary correlations and multivariate statistical analyses. The main sources for the studied compounds in the bus station were diesel/biodiesel exhaust followed by floor resuspension. In the coastal site, vehicular emission, photochemical formation and wood combustion were the main sources for 2-NBA and 3-NBA as well as the other PACs. Incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) were calculated for both places, which presented low values, showing low cancer risk incidence although the ILCR values for the bus station were around 2.5 times higher than the ILCR from the coastal site. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Alcohol increases the risk of both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal neoplasia. In this hospital-based case-control and retrospective cohort study, we sought to determine whether development of colorectal neoplasia increases the risk of HCC in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). In the phase I case-control analysis, the association between history of colorectal cancer (CRC) and HCC development was assessed in patients with ALD by logistic regression modeling (n = 1,659). In the phase II retrospective cohort analysis, the relative risk of HCC development was compared in ALD patients with respect to the history of CRC by a Cox model (n = 1,184). The history of CRC was significantly associated with HCC in the case-control analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.06–3.15; P < 0.05). ALD patients with CRC had higher risk of developing HCC compared to those without CRC (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 5.48; 95% CI, 1.63–18.36; P = 0.006) in the cohort analysis. Presence of CRC, liver cirrhosis, elevated baseline alpha-fetoprotein level, and low platelet counts were independent predictors of HCC development in ALD patients. Patients with history of CRC had an increased risk of HCC in both cirrhotic (HR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.05–13.34, P = 0.041) and non-cirrhotic (HR, 23.46; 95% CI, 2.81–195.83, P = 0.004) ALD patients. In conclusion, ALD patients with CRC are at increased risk of developing HCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "There is an increased demand for efficient biomarkers for the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate plasma levels of TrxR activity in a large population to confirm its validity and efficacy in NSCLC diagnosis. Blood samples were obtained from 1922 participants (638 cases of NSCLC, 555 cases of benign lung diseases (BLDs) and 729 sex- and age-matched healthy controls). The plasma levels of TrxR activity in patients with NSCLC (15.66 ± 11.44 U/ml) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in patients with BLDs (6.27 ± 3.78 U/ml) or healthy controls (2.05 ± 1.86 U/ml). The critical value of plasma TrxR activity levels for diagnosis of NSCLC was set at 10.18 U/ml, with a sensitivity of 71.6% and a specificity of 91.9%. The combination of NSE, CEA, CA19-9, Cyfra21-1, and TrxR was more effective for NSCLC diagnosis (sensitivity and specificity in the training set: 85.6%, 90.2%; validation set: 86.2%, 92.4%) than was each biomarker individually (P < 0.001). TrxR can also efficiently distinguish the metastatic status of the tumor, and it can further differentiate between various histological differentiations. Together, plasma TrxR activity was identified as a convenient, non-invasive, and efficient biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLCs, particularly for discriminating between metastatic and non-metastatic tumors, or for histologic differentiation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recent work has highlighted the potential of metallocorroles as versatile platforms for the development of drugs and imaging agents, since the bioavailability, physicochemical properties and therapeutic activity can be dramatically altered by metal ion substitution and/or functional group replacement. Significant advances in cancer treatment and imaging have been reported based on work with a water-soluble bis-sulfonated gallium corrole in both cellular and rodent-based models. We now show that cytotoxicities increase in the order Ga < Fe < Al < Mn < Sb < Au for bis-sulfonated corroles; and, importantly, that they correlate with metallocorrole affinities for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), the main carrier of lipophilic drugs. As chemotherapeutic potential is predicted to be enhanced by increased lipophilicity, we have developed a novel method for the preparation of cell-penetrating lipophilic metallocorrole/serum-protein nanoparticles (NPs). Cryo-TEM revealed an average core metallocorrole particle size of 32 nm, with protein tendrils extending from the core (conjugate size is ~100 nm). Optical imaging of DU-145 prostate cancer cells treated with corrole NPs (≤100 nM) revealed fast cellular uptake, very slow release, and distribution into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes. The physical properties of corrole NPs prepared in combination with transferrin and albumin were alike, but the former were internalized to a greater extent by the transferrin-receptor-rich DU-145 cells. Our method of preparation of corrole/protein NPs may be generalizable to many bioactive hydrophobic molecules to enhance their bioavailability and target affinity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We focused on the utility of the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) for detecting c-MYC gene copy number (GCN) gain in cell-free plasma and tumor tissue of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. c-MYC GCN status was determined using dual-color silver in situ hybridization (SISH) and ddPCR in retrospective cohort 1 (192 CRC patients) and prospective cohort 2 (64 CRC patients). In cohort 1, c-MYC GCN gain was observed in 34 (17.5%) patients by SISH, and in 7 (3.6%) patients by ddPCR. c-MYC GCN by SISH significantly correlated with ddPCR results (ρ = 0.532, P < 0.001). Although 40 cases (20.7%) showed intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, it did not cause discordance in results obtained by the two methods. c-MYC GCN gain, by both SISH and ddPCR was independently correlated with worst prognosis (P = 0.002). In cohort 2, c-MYC GCN estimation in tissue by ddPCR was also significantly associated with results obtained by SISH (ρ = 0.349, P = 0.005), but correlated with plasma ddPCR with borderline significance (ρ = 0.246, P = 0.050). Additionally, detecting c-MYC GCN gain in plasma with ddPCR might have relatively low sensitivity but high specificity. Our study suggests that ddPCR can be a useful tool for detecting c-MYC GCN gain as a potential prognostic biomarker in CRC tissue samples; however, this will need further verification in plasma samples. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A new and facile approach to selectively functionalize the internal and external surfaces of porous silicon (pSi) for drug delivery applications is reported. To provide a surface that is suitable for sustained drug release of the hydrophobic cancer chemotherapy drug camptothecin (CPT), the internal surfaces of pSi films were first modified with 1-dodecene. To further modify the external surface of the pSi samples, an interlayer was applied by silanization with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) following air plasma treatment. In addition, copolymers of N-(2-hydroxypropyl) acrylamide (HPAm) and N-benzophenone acrylamide (BPAm) were grafted onto the external pSi surfaces by spin-coating and UV crosslinking. Each modification step was verified using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, water contact angle (WCA) measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to confirm that the air plasma treatment and silanization step only occurred on the top surface of pSi samples, confocal microscopy was employed after fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugation. Drug release studies carried out over 17 h in PBS demonstrated that the modified pSi reservoirs released CPT continuously, while showing excellent stability. Furthermore, protein adsorption and cell attachment studies demonstrated the ability of the graft polymer layer to reduce both significantly. In combination with the biocompatible pSi substrate material, the facile modification strategy described in this study provides access to new multifunctional drug delivery systems (DDS) for applications in cancer therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The present study reports the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous root extract of Arnebia hispidissima. They were prepared by adding 10 mL root extract in 90 mL silver nitrate (0.5 mM) solution and heating at 60 ± 2 °C for 12 min at pH 7.5. Characterization of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles was done using UV-Visible spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, dynamic light scattering measurements and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were crystalline in nature exhibiting different shapes like sphere, rod, triangle, hexagon and polygon. Their zeta potential was -23.6 mV confirming their high stability. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed the presence of phenolics, flavonoids and proteins as reducing, capping and stabilizing agents. The synthesized nanoparticles showed effective in vitro anti-oxidant activity against DPPH (IC50 = 9.86 µg/mL) and H2O2 (IC50 = 53.78 µg/mL) radicals. The nanoparticles showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity against HeLa (cervical cancer, IC50 = 4.44 µg/mL) cells and were non-toxic towards normal L20 B cells (non-malignant mouse cell line). They also exhibited strong anti-microbial activity against Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Geotrichum candidum (fungal strains); Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (bacterial strains). This is the first report of synthesis of silver nanoparticles using A. hispidissima root extract validating their bioefficacy against HeLa cancer cells and diverse microorganisms.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Latinas are less likely than non-Latina Whites (NLW) to utilize mammographic screening and are more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer. Here, we examine the effects of county-level factors on guideline-concordant breast-cancer screening behaviors in Latinas and NLWs. Design: Latinas (N=108) and NLW women (N=132) aged >40 years, residing in two adjacent rural, medically underserved counties in eastern Washington State, completed a baseline questionnaire on mammography utilization and demographics. Main Outcomes: Differences in socioeconomic variables and knowledge of screening practices were examined by ethnicity and county of residence. Predictors of having had a mammogram within the past two years were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Ethnicity was not associated with having a guideline-concordant mammogram; however, age (odds ratio [OR]=1.04, 95%CI:1.01-1.08); having >12 years of education (OR=2.09, 95%CI:1.16-3.79); having a regular clinic for health care (OR=2.22, 95%CI:1.05-4.70); having had a prior clinical breast exam (OR=5.07, 95%CI:1.71-15.02), and county of residence (OR=2.27, 95%CI:1.18-4.37) were all associated with having had a guideline-concordant mammogram. Conclusions: County of residence and having had a prior CBE were strong predictors of screening utilization. Community-level factors in medically underserved areas may influence screening patterns. © 2019 Ethnicity & Disease Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The application of layer-by-layer (LbL) approach on nanoparticle surface coating improves the colon-specific drug delivery of insoluble drugs. Here, we aimed to formulate a self-assembled cysteamine-based disulphide cross-linked sodium alginate with LbL self-assembly to improve the delivery of paclitaxel (PCX) to colonic cancer cells. Cysteamine was conjugated to the backbone of oxidized SA to form a core of self-assembled disulphide cross-linked nanospheres. P3DL was selected for PCX loading and fabricated LbL with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium salt (PSSCMA) resulting from characterization and drug release studies. P3DL-fabricated PCX-loaded nanospheres (P3DL/PAH/PSSCMA) exhibited an encapsulation efficiency of 77.1% with cumulative drug release of 45.1%. Dynamic light scattering analysis was reported at 173.6 ± 2.5 nm with polydispersity index of 0.394 ± 0.105 (zeta potential= -58.5 mV). P3DL/PAH/PSSCMA demonstrated a pH-dependent swelling transition; from pH 1 to 7 (102.2% increase). The size increased by 33.0% in reduction response study after incubating with 10 mM glutathione (day 7). HT-29 cells showed high viabilities (86.7%) after treatment with the fabricated nanospheres at 0.8 µg/mL. Cellular internalization was successful with more than 70.0% nanospheres detected in HT-29 cells. Therefore, this fabricated nanospheres may be considered as potential nanocarriers for colon cancer-targeted chemotherapeutic drug delivery.",

    "Abstract": "A large number of miRNAs influence key cellular processes involved in prostate tumorigenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated high expression of miRNAs in human prostate cancer (PC) tissues and cell lines. In previous microarray data, we found miR-141 to be upregulated and miR-145 to be downregulated in PC. In this large PC cohort (n = 535), we explored the prognostic role of miR-141 and miR-145 in PC. Tumor epithelial (TE) and tumor stromal (TS) areas were evaluated separately and combined (TE + TS). In situ hybridization was used to evaluate the expression of the miRNAs. We found that miR-141 (TE) correlated significantly to Gleason score ≥8 (p = 0.040) and large tumor size (≥20 mm, p = 0.025) and miR-141 (TE + TS) to Gleason grade (p = 0.001). MiR-145 correlated to pT-stage (p = 0.038), tumor size (p = 0.025), Gleason grade (p = 0.051) and PSA (p = 0.032). In univariate analysis miR-141 (TE + TS) was significantly associated with biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS, p = 0.007) and clinical failure-free survival (CFFS, p = 0.021). For miR-145, there were no differences between patients with high versus low expression. In multivariate analysis overexpression of miR-141 in tumor epithelium and tumor stroma was significantly associated with BFFS (HR = 1.07 CI95% 1.00–1.14, p = 0.007). To conclude, high expression of miR-141 appears associated with increased risk of biochemical PC recurrence. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Altered branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism is a distinctive feature of various cancers and plays an important role in sustaining tumor proliferation and aggressiveness. Despite the therapeutic and diagnostic potentials, the role of BCAA metabolism in cancer and the activities of associated enzymes remain unclear. Due to its pivotal role in BCAA metabolism and rapid cellular transport, hyperpolarized 13 C-labeled α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), the α-keto acid corresponding to leucine, can assess both BCAA aminotransferase (BCAT) and branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) activities via production of [1- 13 C]leucine or 13 CO 2 (and thus H 13 CO 3 − ), respectively. Here, we investigated BCAA metabolism of F98 rat glioma model in vivo using hyperpolarized 13 C-KIC. In tumor regions, we observed a decrease in 13 C-leucine production from injected hyperpolarized 13 C-KIC via BCAT compared to the contralateral normal-appearing brain, and an increase in H 13 CO 3 − , a catabolic product of KIC through the mitochondrial BCKDC. A parallel ex vivo 13 C NMR isotopomer analysis following steady-state infusion of [U- 13 C]leucine to glioma-bearing rats verified the increased oxidation of leucine in glioma tissue. Both the in vivo hyperpolarized KIC imaging and the leucine infusion study indicate that KIC catabolism is upregulated through BCAT/BCKDC and further oxidized via the citric acid cycle in F98 glioma. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of <8%. Its dismal prognosis stems from inefficient therapeutic modalities owing to the lack of understanding about pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Considering the molecular complexity and heterogeneity of PDAC, identification of novel molecular contributors involved in PDAC onset and progression using global “omics” analysis will pave the way to improved strategies for disease prevention and therapeutic targeting. Meta-analysis of multiple miRNA microarray datasets containing healthy controls (HC), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and PDAC cases, identified 13 miRNAs involved in the progression of PDAC. These miRNAs showed dysregulation in both tissue as well as blood samples, along with progressive decrease in expression from HC to CP to PDAC. Gene-miRNA interaction analysis further elucidated 5 miRNAs (29a/b, 27a, 130b and 148a) that are significantly downregulated in conjunction with concomitant upregulation of their target genes throughout PDAC progression. Among these, miRNA-29a/b targeted genes were found to be most significantly altered in comparative profiling of HC, CP and PDAC, indicating its involvement in malignant evolution. Further, pathway analysis suggested direct involvement of miRNA-29a/b in downregulating the key pathways associated with PDAC development and metastasis including focal adhesion signaling and extracellular matrix organization. Our systems biology data analysis, in combination with real-time PCR validation indicates direct functional involvement of miRNA-29a in PDAC progression and is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic candidate for patients with progressive disease. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Detection of cellular senescence is important not only in the study of senescence in various biological systems, but also in various practical applications such as image-guided surgical removal of senescent cells, as well as the monitoring of drug-responsiveness during cancer therapies. Due to the lack of suitable imaging probes for senescence detection, particularly in living subjects, we have developed an activatable near-infrared (NIR) molecular probe with far-red excitation, NIR emission, and high “turn-on” ratio upon senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SABG) activation. We present here the first successful demonstration of NIR imaging of DNA damage-induced senescence both in vitro and in human tumor xenograft models. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell cancer, is associated with many health challenges, including damage to the kidney by tubulointerstitial fibrosis. We develop a mathematical model which captures the qualitative behavior of the cell and protein populations involved. Specifically, we model the interaction between cells in the proximal tubule of the kidney, free light chains, renal fibroblasts, and myeloma cells. We analyze the model for steady-state solutions to find a mathematically and biologically relevant stable steady-state solution. This foundational model provides a representation of dynamics between key populations in tubulointerstitial fibrosis that demonstrates how these populations interact to affect patient prognosis in patients with MM and renal impairment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Carcinogens often generate mutable DNA lesions that contribute to cancer and aging. However, the chemical structure of tumorigenic DNA lesions formed by acetaldehyde remains unknown, although it has long been considered an environmental mutagen in alcohol, tobacco, and food. Here, we identify an aldehyde-induced DNA lesion, forming an intrastrand crosslink between adjacent guanine bases, but not in single guanine bases or in other combinations of nucleotides. The GG intrastrand crosslink exists in equilibrium in the presence of aldehyde, and therefore it has not been detected or analyzed in the previous investigations. The newly identified GG intrastrand crosslinks might explain the toxicity and mutagenicity of acetaldehyde in DNA metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Over the past 5 years, 55 new anticancer drugs have been launched worldwide. Considering the increasing costs of innovative treatments, both the number and the relevance of cost-effectiveness analyses have increased, meaningfully supporting decision making by stakeholders and policy makers. Notably, cost-effective treatments remain unavailable to patients because they are still unaffordable for a multitude of payers. Objectives: To discuss the differences between cost effectiveness and affordability. Methods: We reviewed the most relevant data on the divergences between cost effectiveness and affordability. In addition, we included our recommendations to improve patients’ access to innovative cancer therapies. Results: The increasing costs of recently launched antineoplastic drugs, as high as $150 000 per year, represent a major barrier to patients’ access to treatments globally. In Brazil, for example, patients’ access to innovative treatments depends greatly on whether the individual has private health insurance. In the public health sector, patients’ access to cost-effective innovative treatments varies according to the financial capacity of the facility, leading to inequalities within the same healthcare system. Conclusions: We conclude that because of the socioeconomic inequality mostly seen in lower and middle-income countries, it is difficult to define a cost-effectiveness threshold by region or a willingness-to-pay threshold affordable to the entire population. We consider that benchmark interventions might help to find an affordable willingness-to-pay threshold, and league table interventions might help policy makers, physicians, and the society to share the decision making. © 2019 ISPOR–The professional society for health economics and outcomes research",

    "Abstract": "Application of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists is a promising approach to treat cancer. In particular, nucleic acid-based TLR agonists such as short ssRNA and dsRNA molecules, which activate endosomal TLRs, can be delivered to tumors by use of nanoparticle delivery systems. However, such delivery systems bear unspecific side effects and poor pharmacokinetics. To overcome these limitations we developed a system for targeted delivery of a 50 bp dsRNA TLR3 agonist (Riboxxol) to treat PSCA-positive tumor cells, which consists of neutravidin conjugated to mono-biotinylated dsRNA and to humanized mono-biotinylated anti-PSCA single chain antibody derivative scFv(h-AM1)-BAP. The assembly of the components resulted in the formation of nanoparticle-like immunoconjugates designated Rapid Inducer of Cellular Inflammation and Apoptosis (RICIA). Anti-PSCA-RICIA exclusively delivered Riboxxol to PSCA-positive tumor cells as well as subcutaneous tumors. Uptake of anti-PSCA-RICIA induced a type I-interferon response and apoptosis in HEK-Blue hTLR3/PSCA reporter cells and PSCA-positive HT1376 bladder cancer cells in vitro. No such effects were observed when using RICIA coupled to an unspecific control antibody or when using Riboxxol alone. Treatment of HT1376 xenografts in immune-deficient hosts with targeted delivery of TLR3 agonist did not induce adverse effects and only modestly inhibited tumor growth when compared to controls. These results suggest promising activation of innate immune response and apoptosis upon selective delivery of TLR3 agonists in tumor cells. Yet, further studies using syngeneic and orthotopic tumor models are needed to fully exploit the potential of RICIA immunoconjugates. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer detection in early stage using a powerful and noninvasive tool is of high global interest. In this experiment, a small-molecular-weight glucose based derivative of Gd 3+ -1-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl) diethylene tri amine penta acetic acid (Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA-DG) as a novel potential MR imaging contrast agents was synthesized. Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA-DG was synthesized with reacting of Glucosamine and 1-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl) diethylene triamine penta acetic acid then loaded by gadolinium to make novel agent of functional MR imaging. The relaxivity, T 1 , T 2 relaxation times, and cell toxicity of this contrast agent were studied. The results demonstrated that the sugar moieties linked to Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA efficiently increase its cellular uptake in normal cells 25% and in cancereous cells upto 67%. The Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA-DG significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased MCF-7 tumor cell numbers without any significant toxicity on normal human kidney cells. Finally, it displayed an intense signal on T 1 weighted with respect to the unlabeled cells. Based on the findings from the present research Gd 3+ -p-SCN-Bn-DTPA-DG be a potential breast molecular imaging. However, further investigations by anticancer studies are in the pipeline. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that can selectively target unresectable tumors through optical activation of cytotoxic agents, thus reducing many side effects associated with systemic administration of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, limited light penetration into most biological tissues have so far prevented its widespread adoption beyond dermatology and a few other oncological applications in which a fiber optic can be threaded to the desired locations via an endoscopic approach (e.g., bladder). In this paper, we introduce an ultrasonically powered implantable microlight source, μLight, which enables in-situ localized light delivery to deep-seated solid tumors. Ultrasonic powering allows for small receiver form factor (mm-scale) and power transfer deep into the tissue (several centimeters). The implants consist of piezoelectric transducers measuring 2 × 2 × 2 mm 3 and 2 × 4 × 2 mm 3 with surface-mounted miniature red and blue LEDs. When energized with 185 mW/cm 2 of transmitted acoustic power at 720 kHz, μLight can generate 0.048 to 6.5 mW/cm 2 of optical power (depending on size of the piezoelectric element and light wavelength spectrum). This allows powering multiple receivers to a distance of 10 cm at therapeutic light output levels (a delivery of 20–40 J/cm 2 light radiation dose in 1–2 hours). In vitro tests show that HeLa cells irradiated with μLights undergo a 70% decrease in average cell viability as compared to the control group. In vivo tests in mice implanted with 4T1-induced tumors (breast cancer) show light delivery capability at therapeutic dose levels. Overall, results indicate implanting multiple µLights and operating them for 1–2 hours can achieve cytotoxicity levels comparable to the clinically reported cases using external light sources. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapy has only limited efficacy against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) due to the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor-associated stroma. Here, we demonstrate an effective modulation of that stroma by irreversible electroporation (IRE), a local ablation technique that has received regulatory approval in the United States. IRE induces immunogenic cell death, activates dendritic cells, and alleviates stroma-induced immunosuppression without depleting tumor-restraining collagen. The combination of IRE and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) immune checkpoint blockade promotes selective tumor infiltration by CD8 + T cells and significantly prolongs survival in a murine orthotopic PDAC model with a long-term memory immune response. Our results suggest that IRE is a promising approach to potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in PDAC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most prevalent leukaemia in Western countries. It is an incurable disease characterized by a highly variable clinical course. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is an ideal model for studying clonal heterogeneity and dynamics during cancer progression, response to therapy and/or relapse because the disease usually develops over several years. Here we report an analysis by deep sequencing of sequential samples taken at different times from the affected organs of two patients with 12- and 7-year disease courses, respectively. One of the patients followed a linear pattern of clonal evolution, acquiring and selecting new mutations in response to salvage therapy and/or allogeneic transplantation, while the other suffered loss of cellular tumoral clones during progression and histological transformation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bilirubin is the major catabolic product of heme degradation. It has long been regarded as an unimportant waste product. However, within the last twenty-five years, it has been demonstrated to play a very important role in maintaining the bodys redox equilibrium. Disturbances of this equilibrium - increased oxidative stress - are currently considered one of the major risk factors for the development of non-communicable diseases. Although the exact mechanism is not known, a number of human studies have proved a reduced incidence of a number of (especially cardiovascular but also cancer) diseases in individuals with mildly elevated bilirubin concentrations. Key words: bilirubin - cardiovascular disease - morbidity - mortality.",

    "Abstract": "In breast cancer (BC), elevated levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in tumor tissue have been confirmed as a strong prognostic factor in level-of-evidence-1 studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of uPA levels in serum of metastatic BC patients and to compare uPA with other blood-based biomarkers. 252 patients were enrolled in this prospective, multicentre study. Blood samples were collected before begin of first-line or later-line systemic treatment. Serum uPA was quantified by a commercially available ELISA. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected using CellSearch; other biomarkers (EGFR, VEGF, HER2, RAS p21, TIMP1, CAIX) by ELISA. Using the ROC analysis, the optimal cut-off value (determined by the Youden index) of serum uPA was 2.52 ng/ml. Using this value, 26% of patients had elevated uPA levels. Patients with visceral metastasis and more than one metastatic site were significantly more likely to present with elevated uPA levels. CTC status, serum HER2, RAS p21, CAIX, TIMP1 and VEGF correlated significantly with uPA levels. Elevated uPA levels predicted shorter overall and progression-free survival in univariate analysis (median OS: 7.5 months [95%-CI 4.5–10.5 months] vs. not reached, p < 0.001; PFS: 4.8 [95%-CI: 3.1–6.5] vs. 9.1 [7.4–10.8] months, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, elevated uPA, presence of ≥5 CTCs, elevated RAS p21, higher grading and higher line of therapy were independent predictors of shorter OS, while elevated CTC counts, higher line of therapy and negative estrogen receptor status were independent predictors of shorter PFS. In conclusion, elevated uPA levels independently predict reduced overall survival and improved prognostication in patients with known CTC status. Whether high serum uPA might identify patients most likely to benefit from therapies targeting uPA, remains to be evaluated in future trials. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "ICD-85 (venom derived peptides) has anti-proliferative effect and anti-angiogenesis activity on cancer cells. This study was performed to test the effect of ICD-85, on Human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDF) cell lines. In this experimental study, Mitochondrial activity, Neutral red uptake, Lactate dehydrogenase (cell necrosis), and cell morphology were assessed under unexposed and ICD-85 exposed conditions. Caspase-9 colorimetric assay kit was used to determine caspase protease activity. Morphological changes in MCF-7 cells on treatment with ICD-85 compared with untreated MCF-7 cells are consistent with characterizing the features of apoptosis such as granulation and cell rounding which finally results in the generation of apoptotic bodies. In contrast, this difference was not observed in normal cells. In MTT assay, ICD-85 induced dose dependent manner cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells which were confirmed by neutral red assay. The results showed that inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) value of ICD-85 for MCF-7 cells at 24 h was 36.45 ± 0.38 μg/mL. However, when HDF cells were exposed to ICD-85, no significant elevation of LDH release were observed at concentrations below 20 μg/mL. The apoptosis-induction of ICD-85 on MCF-7 cell was found to be through activation of caspase-9 which was 13 fold greater than unexposed cell. This study showed that ICD-85 induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cell line through caspase activation and hence it can be considered for further investigation to use ICD-85 as a potential therapy for breast cancer. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Wnt-induced β-catenin-mediated transcription is a driving force for stem cell self-renewal during adult tissue homeostasis. Enhanced Wnt receptor expression due to mutational inactivation of the ubiquitin ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 recently emerged as a leading cause for cancer development. Consequently, targeting canonical Wnt receptors such as LRP5/6 holds great promise for treatment of such cancer subsets. Here, we employ CIS display technology to identify single-domain antibody fragments (VHH) that bind the LRP6 P3E3P4E4 region with nanomolar affinity and strongly inhibit Wnt3/3a-induced β-catenin-mediated transcription in cells, while leaving Wnt1 responses unaffected. Structural analysis reveal that individual VHHs variably employ divergent antigen-binding regions to bind a similar surface in the third β-propeller of LRP5/6, sterically interfering with Wnt3/3a binding. Importantly, anti-LRP5/6 VHHs block the growth of Wnt-hypersensitive Rnf43/Znrf3-mutant intestinal organoids through stem cell exhaustion and collective terminal differentiation. Thus, VHH-mediated targeting of LRP5/6 provides a promising differentiation-inducing strategy for treatment of Wnt-hypersensitive tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Accurate genome-wide detection of somatic mutations with low variant allele frequency (VAF, <1%) has proven difficult, for which generalized, scalable methods are lacking. Herein, we describe a new computational method, called RePlow, that we developed to detect low-VAF somatic mutations based on simple, library-level replicates for next-generation sequencing on any platform. Through joint analysis of replicates, RePlow is able to remove prevailing background errors in next-generation sequencing analysis, facilitating remarkable improvement in the detection accuracy for low-VAF somatic mutations (up to ~99% reduction in false positives). The method is validated in independent cancer panel and brain tissue sequencing data. Our study suggests a new paradigm with which to exploit an overwhelming abundance of sequencing data for accurate variant detection. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We report herein on the design, synthesis and biological activity of Ru-based self-assembled supramolecular bowls as a potent anticancer therapeutic in human hepatocellular cancer. The potent complex induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by higher fatty acid β-oxidation and down-regulation of glucose transporter-mediated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 via reduced hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. Also, overexpressed acetyl-CoA activates the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport system and induces hypergeneration of ROS. Finally, ROS overexpressed through this pathway leads to apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the naphthalene derived molecular bowl activates classical apoptosis via crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic signal pathway. Our work into the mechanism of Ru-based self-assembled supramolecular bowls can provide valuable insight into the potential for use as a promising anticancer agent. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) is involved in the repair and prevention of uracil misincorporations into DNA. Maintenance of DNA integrity is critical for cancer prevention. Many studies have identified susceptibility loci and genetic variants in cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the distribution frequency of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the dUTPase-encoding gene DUT in a case-control study to identify the relationship between DUT genetic variants and cervical cancer susceptibility. Six DUT intronic SNPs (rs28381106, rs3784619, rs10851465, rs28381126, rs3784621 and rs11637235) were genotyped by mismatch amplification-PCR in 400 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs), 400 precursor cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III lesions and 1,200 normal controls. No correlations were found between four DUT SNPs (rs3784621, rs10851465, rs28381106 and rs28381126) and CIN III and CSCC risk. However, the homozygous GG allele of rs3784619 and TT allele of rs11637235 correlated significantly with increased risk of CIN III and CSCC (OR = 2.29, 2.05; OR = 3.15, 3.15, respectively). Individuals with the G allele or G carrier allele (AG + GG) at rs3784619 and with the T allele or T carrier allele (CT + TT) at rs11637235 were at higher risk for CIN III and CSCC (OR = 1.26, 1.30; OR = 1.41, 1.65, respectively). Similarly, in the human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive groups, we found that the homozygous GG alleles of rs3784619 and TT alleles of rs11637235 markedly increased the risk of CIN III and CSCC (OR = 2.44, 2.71; OR = 3.32, 4.04, respectively). When performing a stratified analysis of sexual and reproductive histories, we found that the GG genotype of rs3784619 had a particularly high level of enrichment in the group of patients with > one sexual partner in CIN III (P = 0.043) and CSCC (P = 0.007). Meanwhile, the TT genotype of rs11637235 was enriched for in the high risk HPV (HR-HPV)-positive cases of CIN III (P = 0.033) and CSCC (P = 0.022). Analysis of the haplotype between rs3784619 (A/G) and rs11637235 (C/T) revealed that the genotypes with AA-TT (OR = 2.59), AG-TT (OR = 2.29), GG-CC (OR = 2.72), GG-CT (OR = 3.01 (1.83–4.96)) were significantly associated with increased risk of CIN III. More notably, this risk was much greater for CSCC (AA-TT (OR = 3.62), AG-TT (OR = 5.08), GG-CC (OR = 5.28), and GG-CT (OR = 4.23). Additionally, most GG genotypes of rs3784619 were linkage GG-CT, while most TT genotypes of rs11637235 were linkage AA-TT. In conclusion, these findings suggested that the homozygous GG allele of rs3784619 and the TT allele of rs11637235 in the DUT gene significantly increased the risk of CIN III and CSCC. Most GG genotypes of rs3784619 and TT genotypes of rs11637235 were linkage GG-CT and AA-TT, respectively. The TT genotype of rs11637235 was enriched in the HR-HPV-positive cases. These two SNPs of the DUT gene can be early predictive biomarkers of CIN III and CSCC, and may be involved in HR HPV infection. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The splice variant sVEGFR1-i13 is a truncated version of the cell membrane-spanning VEGFR1 receptor that is devoid of its transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains. We recently showed the contribution of sVEGFR1-i13 to the progression and the response of squamous lung carcinoma to anti-angiogenic therapies. In this study, we identify VEGF165, a splice variant of VEGF-A, as a regulator of sVEGFR1-i13 expression in these tumors, and further show that VEGF165 cooperates with the transcription factor SOX2 and the splicing factor SRSF2 to control sVEGFR1-i13 expression. We also demonstrate that anti-angiogenic therapies up-regulate sVEGFR1-i13 protein level in squamous lung carcinoma cells by a mechanism involving the VEGF165/SOX2/SRSF2 network. Collectively, our results identify for the first time a signaling network that controls VEGFR1 pre-mRNA alternative splicing in cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant and highly aggressive brain tumor. In this study, four types of typical GBM cell lines (LN229, SNB19, U87, U251) were cultured in a microfabricated 3-D model to study their in vitro behaviors. The 3-D in vitro model provides hollow micro-chamber arrays containing a natural collagen interface and thus allows the GBM cells to grow in the 3-D chambers. The GBM cells in this model showed specific properties on the aspects of cell morphology, proliferation, migration, and invasion, some of which were rarely observed before. Furthermore, how the cells invaded into the surrounding ECM and the corresponding specific invasion patterns were observed in details, implying that the four types of cells have different features during their development in cancer. This complex in vitro model, if applied to patient derived cells, possesses the potential of becoming a clinically relevant predictive model. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Polyamines, often elevated in cancer cells, have been shown to promote cell growth and proliferation. Whether polyamines regulate other cell functions remains unclear. Here, we explore whether and how polyamines affect genome integrity. When DNA double-strand break (DSB) is induced in hair follicles by ionizing radiation, reduction of cellular polyamines augments dystrophic changes with delayed regeneration. Mechanistically, polyamines facilitate homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair without affecting repair via non-homologous DNA end-joining and single-strand DNA annealing. Biochemical reconstitution and functional analyses demonstrate that polyamines enhance the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 recombinase. The effect of polyamines on RAD51 stems from their ability to enhance the capture of homologous duplex DNA and synaptic complex formation by the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. Our work demonstrates a novel function of polyamines in the maintenance of genome integrity via homology-directed DNA repair. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based lipidomics is the primary tool for the structural analysis of lipids but the effective localization of carbon–carbon double bonds (C=C) in unsaturated lipids to distinguish C=C location isomers remains challenging. Here, we develop a large-scale lipid analysis platform by coupling online C=C derivatization through the Paternò-Büchi reaction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This provides rich information on lipid C=C location isomers, revealing C=C locations for more than 200 unsaturated glycerophospholipids in bovine liver among which we identify 55 groups of C=C location isomers. By analyzing tissue samples of patients with breast cancer and type 2 diabetes plasma samples, we find that the ratios of C=C isomers are much less affected by interpersonal variations than their individual abundances, suggesting that isomer ratios may be used for the discovery of lipid biomarkers. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The presence of aberrant number of centrioles is a recognized cause of aneuploidy and hallmark of cancer. Hence, centriole duplication needs to be tightly regulated. It has been proposed that centriole separation limits centrosome duplication. The mechanism driving centriole separation is poorly understood and little is known on how this is linked to centriole duplication. Here, we propose that actin-generated forces regulate centriole separation. By imposing geometric constraints via micropatterns, we were able to prove that precise acto-myosin force arrangements control direction, distance and time of centriole separation. Accordingly, inhibition of acto-myosin contractility impairs centriole separation. Alongside, we observed that organization of acto-myosin force modulates specifically the length of S-G2 phases of the cell cycle, PLK4 recruitment at the centrosome and centriole fidelity. These discoveries led us to suggest that acto-myosin forces might act in fundamental mechanisms of aneuploidy prevention. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Fulvestrant (Ful) is an effective and widely used agent for first- and second-line treatment of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative (HR+/HER2−) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, there is no evidence of treatment after progression on Ful. Our study aimed to investigate the profile of daily practice regarding therapy after Ful. A consecutive series of 131 HR+, HER2- MBC patients who failed Ful 500 mg as first-line or second-line therapy from June 2014 to June 2017 in 6 institutions were included and analysed. Among 131 patients who failed Ful with similar baseline characteristics, 31 (23.7%) received endocrine therapy (ET), and 100 (76.3%) were treated with chemotherapy (CT). The most frequently applied CT regimen was capecitabine (32%), and the ET regimen was exemestane + everolimus (35.5%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with bone-only metastasis were associated with lower CT use (OR = 7.97, 95% CI 1.51–41.84, P = 0.01). Among patients who received CT and ET as subsequent treatments, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months (95% CI 6.2–8.8) and 6.0 months (95% CI 4.1–7.9), respectively (p = 0.03). Among patients who were resistant to Ful (PFS < 6 months), the PFS on CT was significantly longer than that on ET (7.1 months vs 3.9 months, p = 0.024, HR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.26–0.97); however, among patients with a PFS ≥6 months on Ful, the efficacy of CT and ET was similar. Additionally, among patients with an older age, bone-only metastasis and ≥3 metastatic sites, no significant difference was observed between the CT and ET groups. Moreover, ET was much more tolerated than CT in terms of the incidence of grade 3/4 toxicities (9.6% vs 27%, P < 0.05). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Thus, our findings reveal the pattern of post-Ful treatment in current clinical practice and provide evidence on the efficacy, safety and choice of these treatments. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A series of new Olaparib derivatives was designed and synthesized, and their inhibitory activities against poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases-1 (PARP-1) enzyme and cancer cell line MDA-MB-436 in vitro were evaluated. The results showed that compound 5l exhibited the most potent inhibitory effects on PARP-1 enzyme (16.10 ± 1.25 nM) and MDA-MB-436 cancer cell (11.62 ± 2.15 μM), which was close to that of Olaparib. As a PARP-1 inhibitor had been reported to be viable to neuroprotection, in order to search for new multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the inhibitory activities of the synthesized compounds against the enzymes AChE (from electric eel) and BChE (from equine serum) were also tested. Compound 5l displayed moderate BChE inhibitory activity (9.16 ± 0.91 μM) which was stronger than neostigmine (12.01 ± 0.45 μM) and exhibited selectivity for BChE over AChE to some degree. Molecular docking studies indicated that 5l could bind simultaneously to the catalytic active of PARP-1, but it could not interact well with huBChE. For pursuit of PARP-1 and BChE dual-targeted inhibitors against AD, small and flexible non-polar groups introduced to the compound seemed to be conducive to improving its inhibitory potency on huBChE, while keeping phthalazine-1-one moiety unchanged which was mainly responsible for PARP-1 inhibitory activity. Our research gave a clue to search for new agents based on AChE and PARP-1 dual-inhibited activities to treat Alzheimer's disease.",

    "Abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the common type of cancer in humans. A combinatorial approach has been done by using paclitaxel (PTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and ascorbic acid (AA) loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) for its treatment. SLN were made by high-speed homogenization and ultrasonication technique and they were used alone and in combination to check their efficacy against OSCC induced animal model. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution study of the optimized formulations for PTX, 5-FU and AA loaded SLN was performed. The SLN shows a biphasic nature of drug release both in the in-vitro and in-vivo system. SLN loaded with PTX in combination with SLN loaded with AA shows a greater potency in the treatment of OSCC in-vivo. The Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies of SLN depict a better therapeutic efficacy. The combination of PTX and AA loaded SLN can be a novel approach for the treatment of OSCC.",

    "Abstract": "Taxanes are a family of natural products with a broad spectrum of anticancer activity. This activity is mediated by interaction with the taxane site of beta-tubulin, leading to microtubule stabilization and cell death. Although widely used in the treatment of breast cancer and other malignancies, existing taxane-based therapies including paclitaxel and the second-generation docetaxel are currently limited by severe adverse effects and dose-limiting toxicity. To discover taxane site modulators, we employ a computational binding site similarity screen of > 14,000 drug-like pockets from PDB, revealing an unexpected similarity between the estrogen receptor and the beta-tubulin taxane binding pocket. Evaluation of nine selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) via cellular and biochemical assays confirms taxane site interaction, microtubule stabilization, and cell proliferation inhibition. Our study demonstrates that SERMs can modulate microtubule assembly and raises the possibility of an estrogen receptor-independent mechanism for inhibiting cell proliferation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) is a key enzyme that converts 6-phosphogluconate into ribulose-5-phosphate with NADP + as cofactor in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). 6PGD is commonly upregulated and plays important roles in many human cancers, while the mechanism underlying such roles of 6PGD remains elusive. Here we show that upon EGFR activation, 6PGD is phosphorylated at tyrosine (Y) 481 by Src family kinase Fyn. This phosphorylation enhances 6PGD activity by increasing its binding affinity to NADP + and therefore activates the PPP for NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, which consequently detoxifies intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and accelerates DNA synthesis. Abrogating 6PGD Y481 phosphorylation (pY481) dramatically attenuates EGF-promoted glioma cell proliferation, tumor growth and resistance to ionizing radiation. In addition, 6PGD pY481 is associated with Fyn expression, the malignancy and prognosis of human glioblastoma. These findings establish a critical role of Fyn-dependent 6PGD phosphorylation in EGF-promoted tumor growth and radiation resistance. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The distribution of single-cell properties across a population of cells can be measured using diverse tools, but no technology directly quantifies the biochemical stimulation events regulating these properties. Here we report digital counting of growth factors in single cells using fluorescent quantum dots and calibrated three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy (QDC-3DM) to reveal physiologically relevant cell stimulation distributions. We calibrate the fluorescence intensities of individual compact quantum dots labeled with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and demonstrate the necessity of near-infrared emission to overcome intrinsic cellular autofluoresence at the single-molecule level. When applied to human triple-negative breast cancer cells, we observe proportionality between stimulation and both receptor internalization and inhibitor response, reflecting stimulation heterogeneity contributions to intrinsic variability. We anticipate that QDC-3DM can be applied to analyze any peptidic ligand to reveal single-cell correlations between external stimulation and phenotypic variability, cell fate, and drug response. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "CD133 is a transmembranous protein that mainly localises to the plasma membrane in haematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as cancer stem cells. Although CD133 also localises to the cytoplasm, the mechanism of action and function of cytoplasmic CD133 currently remain unknown. We herein demonstrated that when Src family kinase activity is weak, CD133 interacts with HDAC6 and is transported to the pericentrosomal region after internalization and endosome formation via the dynein-based traffic system. Pericentrosomal CD133 is then recycled to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. At the pericentrosomal region, endosomal CD133 captures GABARAP, an initiator of autophagy, and inhibits GABARAP-mediated ULK1 activation and the subsequent initiation of autophagy. Furthermore, pericentrosomal CD133 suppresses cell differentiation, such as primary cilium formation and neurite outgrowth, by inhibiting autophagy. Thus, the present results provide evidence to suggest that pericentrosomal CD133 has the unique property of maintaining the undifferentiated status of cells by inhibiting autophagy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Consensus ranking of protein affinity to identify point mutations has not been established. Therefore, analytical techniques that can detect subtle variations without interfering with native biomolecular interactions are required. Here we report a rapid method to identify point mutations by a single nanoparticle sensing system. DNA-directed gold crystallization forms rod-like nanoparticles with bridges based on structural design. The nanoparticles enhance Rayleigh light scattering, achieving high refractive-index sensitivity, and enable the system to monitor even a small number of protein-DNA binding events without interference. Analysis of the binding affinity can compile an atlas to distinguish the potential of various point mutations recognized by MutS protein. We use the atlas to analyze the presence and type of single point mutations in BRCA1 from samples of human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. The strategy of synthesis-by-design of plasmonic nanoparticles for sensors enables direct identification of subtle biomolecular binding distortions and genetic alterations. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Generating a protective and long-lasting immune response is the primary goal in the expanding field of immunotherapeutic research. In current study we designed an immunogenic bacteriophage- based vaccine to induce a cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity against a mice tumor model over-expressing HER2/neu. Bacteriophage λ displaying a HER2/neu derived peptide GP2 was constructed and used as an anti-cancer vaccine in a BALB/c mouse xenograft tumor model. The results of our study indicated that phage nanoparticles displaying GP2 as a fused peptide to the gpD phage capsid protein induced a robust CTL response. Furthermore, the chimeric phage nanoparticles protected mice against HER2/neu-positive tumor challenge in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. In conclusion, we propose that λ phage nanoparticles decorated with GP2 peptide merit further investigation for the development of peptide-based vaccines against HER2/neu overexpressing tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The exosome functions to regulate the cellular transcriptome through RNA biogenesis, surveillance, and decay. Mutations in Dis3, a catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome with separable endonuclease and exonuclease activities, are linked to multiple myeloma. Here we report that a cancer-associated DIS3 allele, dis3E729K, provides evidence for DIS3 functioning in mitotic fidelity in yeast. This dis3E729K allele does not induce defects in 7S→5.8S rRNA processing, although it elicits a requirement for P-body function. While it does not significantly influence cell cycle progression alone, the allele reduces the efficiency of cell cycle arrest in strains with defects in kinetochore assembly. Finally, point mutations in the exonuclease domains of yeast Dis3 elicit genome instability phenotypes; however, these DIS3 mutations do not increase DNA damage or RNA processing defects that lead to the accumulation of polyadenylated RNA in the nucleus. These data suggest that specific DIS3 activities support mitotic fidelity in yeast.",

    "Abstract": "Sex-stratified medicine is a fundamentally important, yet understudied, facet of modern medical care. A data-driven model for how to systematically analyze population-wide, longitudinal differences in hospital admissions between men and women is needed. Here, we demonstrate a systematic analysis of all diseases and disease co-occurrences in the complete Danish population using the ICD-10 and Global Burden of Disease terminologies. Incidence rates of single diagnoses are different for men and women in most cases. The age at first diagnosis is typically lower for men, compared to women. Men and women share many disease co-occurrences. However, many sex-associated incongruities not linked directly to anatomical or genomic differences are also found. Analysis of multi-step trajectories uncover differences in longitudinal patterns, for example concerning injuries and substance abuse, cancer, and osteoporosis. The results point towards the need for an increased focus on sex-stratified medicine to elucidate the origins of the socio-economic and ethological differences. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Class F receptors are considered valuable therapeutic targets due to their role in human disease, but structural changes accompanying receptor activation remain unexplored. Employing population and cancer genomics data, structural analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, resonance energy transfer-based approaches and mutagenesis, we identify a conserved basic amino acid in TM6 in Class F receptors that acts as a molecular switch to mediate receptor activation. Across all tested Class F receptors (FZD 4,5,6,7, SMO), mutation of the molecular switch confers an increased potency of agonists by stabilizing an active conformation as assessed by engineered mini G proteins as conformational sensors. Disruption of the switch abrogates the functional interaction between FZDs and the phosphoprotein Dishevelled, supporting conformational selection as a prerequisite for functional selectivity. Our studies reveal the molecular basis of a common activation mechanism conserved in all Class F receptors, which facilitates assay development and future discovery of Class F receptor-targeting drugs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment limits the success of current immunotherapies. The host retains memory T cells specific for previous infections throughout the entire body that are capable of executing potent and immediate immunostimulatory functions. Here we show that virus-specific memory T cells extend their surveillance to mouse and human tumors. Reactivating these antiviral T cells can arrest growth of checkpoint blockade-resistant and poorly immunogenic tumors in mice after injecting adjuvant-free non-replicating viral peptides into tumors. Peptide mimics a viral reinfection event to memory CD8+ T cells, triggering antigen presentation and cytotoxic pathways within the tumor, activating dendritic cells and natural killer cells, and recruiting the adaptive immune system. Viral peptide treatment of ex vivo human tumors recapitulates immune activation gene expression profiles observed in mice. Lastly, peptide therapy renders resistant mouse tumors susceptible to PD-L1 blockade. Thus, re-stimulating known antiviral immunity may provide a unique therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Inactivating mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1), a key SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling gene, underlie small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT). To reveal its druggable vulnerabilities, we perform kinase-focused RNAi screens and uncover that SMARCA4-deficient SCCOHT cells are highly sensitive to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6). SMARCA4 loss causes profound downregulation of cyclin D1, which limits CDK4/6 kinase activity in SCCOHT cells and leads to in vitro and in vivo susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibitors. SCCOHT patient tumors are deficient in cyclin D1 yet retain the retinoblastoma-proficient/p16 INK4a -deficient profile associated with positive responses to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Thus, our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors, approved for a breast cancer subtype addicted to CDK4/6 activation, could be repurposed to treat SCCOHT. Moreover, our study suggests a novel paradigm whereby critically low oncogene levels, caused by loss of a driver tumor suppressor, may also be exploited therapeutically. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Due to loss of tactile feedback the assessment of tumor margins during robotic surgery is based only on visual inspection, which is neither significantly sensitive nor specific. Here we demonstrate time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) as a novel technique to complement the visual inspection of oral cancers during transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in real-time and without the need for exogenous contrast agents. TRFS enables identification of cancerous tissue by its distinct autofluorescence signature that is associated with the alteration of tissue structure and biochemical profile. A prototype TRFS instrument was integrated synergistically with the da Vinci Surgical robot and the combined system was validated in swine and human patients. Label-free and real-time assessment and visualization of tissue biochemical features during robotic surgery procedure, as demonstrated here, not only has the potential to improve the intraoperative decision making during TORS but also other robotic procedures without modification of conventional clinical protocols. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are responsible for the immunologic tolerance of liver which is a common site for visceral metastases, suggesting its potential role as an target for cancer immunotherapy. However, targeted modulation of LSECs is still not achieved thus far. Here, we report LSECs are specifically targeted and modulated by melittin nanoparticles (α-melittin-NPs). Intravital imaging shows that LSECs fluoresce within 20 s after intravenous injection of α-melittin-NPs. α-melittin-NPs trigger the activation of LSECs and lead to dramatic changes of cytokine/chemokine milieu in the liver, which switches the hepatic immunologic environment to the activated state. As a result, α-melittin-NPs resist the formation of metastatic lesions with high efficiency. More strikingly, the survival rate reaches 80% in the spontaneous liver metastatic tumor model. Our research provides support for the use of α-melittin-NPs to break LSEC-mediated immunologic tolerance, which opens an avenue to control liver metastasis through the immunomodulation of LSECs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Rix7 is an essential type II AAA-ATPase required for the formation of the large ribosomal subunit. Rix7 has been proposed to utilize the power of ATP hydrolysis to drive the removal of assembly factors from pre-60S particles, but the mechanism of release is unknown. Rix7’s mammalian homolog, NVL2 has been linked to cancer and mental illness disorders, highlighting the need to understand the molecular mechanisms of this essential machine. Here we report the cryo-EM reconstruction of the tandem AAA domains of Rix7 which form an asymmetric stacked homohexameric ring. We trapped Rix7 with a polypeptide in the central channel, revealing Rix7’s role as a molecular unfoldase. The structure establishes that type II AAA-ATPases lacking the aromatic-hydrophobic motif within the first AAA domain can engage a substrate throughout the entire central channel. The structure also reveals that Rix7 contains unique post-α7 insertions within both AAA domains important for Rix7 function. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticles from magnetotactic bacteria have been used in conventional imaging, drug delivery, and magnetic manipulations. Here, we show that these natural nanoparticles and their bioinspired hybrids with near-infrared gold nanorods and folic acid can serve as molecular high-contrast photoacoustic probes for single-cell diagnostics and as photothermal agents for single-cell therapy using laser-induced vapor nanobubbles and magnetic field as significant signal and therapy amplifiers. These theranostics agents enable the detection and photomechanical killing of triple negative breast cancer cells that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy, with just one or a few low-energy laser pulses. In studies in vivo, we discovered that circulating tumor cells labeled with the nanohybrids generate transient ultrasharp photoacoustic resonances directly in the bloodstream as the basis for new super-resolution photoacoustic flow cytometry in vivo. These properties make natural and bioinspired magnetic nanoparticles promising biocompatible, multimodal, high-contrast, and clinically relevant cellular probes for many in vitro and in vivo biomedical applications. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recently, exosomes secreted by menstrual mesenchymal stem cells have been identified as inhibitory agents of tumor angiogenesis and modulators of the tumor cell secretome in prostate and breast cancer. However, their direct effect on endothelial cells and paracrine mediators have not yet been investigated. Using a carrier-based cell culture system to test the scalability for exosome production, we showed that different types of endothelial cells present specific kinetics for exosomes internalization. Exosome-treatment of endothelial cells increased cytotoxicity and reduced VEGF secretion and angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Using the hamster buccal pouch carcinoma as a preclinical model for human oral squamous cell carcinoma, we demonstrated a significant antitumor effect of intra-tumoral injection of exosomes associated with a loss of tumor vasculature. These results address up-scaling of exosome production, a relevant issue for their clinical application, and also assess menstrual stem cell exosomes as potential anti-angiogenic agents for the treatment of neoplastic conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Obesity is a medical condition that impacts on all levels of society and causes numerous comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We assessed the suitability of targeting enolase, a glycolysis pathway enzyme with multiple, secondary functions in cells, to treat obesity. Treating adipocytes with ENOblock, a novel modulator of these secondary ‘moonlighting’ functions of enolase, suppressed the adipogenic program and induced mitochondrial uncoupling. Obese animals treated with ENOblock showed a reduction in body weight and increased core body temperature. Metabolic and inflammatory parameters were improved in the liver, adipose tissue and hippocampus. The mechanism of ENOblock was identified as transcriptional repression of master regulators of lipid homeostasis (Srebp-1a and Srebp-1c), gluconeogenesis (Pck-1) and inflammation (Tnf-α and Il-6). ENOblock treatment also reduced body weight gain, lowered cumulative food intake and increased fecal lipid content in mice fed a high fat diet. Our results support the further drug development of ENOblock as a therapeutic for obesity and suggest enolase as a new target for this disorder. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Faithful chromosome segregation requires proper chromosome congression at prometaphase and dynamic maintenance of the aligned chromosomes at metaphase. Chromosome missegregation can result in aneuploidy, birth defects and cancer. The kinetochore-bound KMN network and the kinesin motor CENP-E are critical for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome stability. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) attaches linear ubiquitin chains to substrates, with well-established roles in immune response. Here, we identify LUBAC as a key player of chromosome alignment during mitosis. LUBAC catalyzes linear ubiquitination of the kinetochore motor CENP-E, which is specifically required for the localization of CENP-E at attached kinetochores, but not unattached ones. KNL1 acts as a receptor of linear ubiquitin chains to anchor CENP-E at attached kinetochores in prometaphase and metaphase. Thus, linear ubiquitination promotes chromosome congression and dynamic chromosome alignment by coupling the dynamic kinetochore microtubule receptor CENP-E to the static one, the KMN network. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite significant progress, our understanding of how specific oncogenes transform cells is still limited and likely underestimates the complexity of downstream signalling events. To address this gap, we use mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics to characterize the global impact of an oncogene on the expressed kinome, and then functionally annotate the regulated kinases. As an example, we identify 63 protein kinases exhibiting altered expression and/or phosphorylation in Src-transformed mammary epithelial cells. An integrated siRNA screen identifies nine kinases, including SGK1, as being essential for Src-induced transformation. Accordingly, we find that Src positively regulates SGK1 expression in triple negative breast cancer cells, which exhibit a prominent signalling network governed by Src family kinases. Furthermore, combined inhibition of Src and SGK1 reduces colony formation and xenograft growth more effectively than either treatment alone. Therefore, this approach not only provides mechanistic insights into oncogenic transformation but also aids the design of improved therapeutic strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The upregulation of PPARγ/RXRα transcriptional activity has emerged as a key event in luminal bladder tumors. It renders tumor cell growth PPARγ-dependent and modulates the tumor microenvironment to favor escape from immuno-surveillance. The activation of the pathway has been linked to PPARG gains/amplifications resulting in PPARγ overexpression and to recurrent activating point mutations of RXRα. Here, we report recurrent mutations of PPARγ that also activate the PPARγ/RXRα pathway, conferring PPARγ-dependency and supporting a crucial role of PPARγ in luminal bladder cancer. These mutations are found throughout the protein—including N-terminal, DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains—and most of them enhance protein activity. Structure-function studies of PPARγ variants with mutations in the ligand-binding domain allow identifying structural elements that underpin their gain-of-function. Our study reveals genomic alterations of PPARG that lead to pro-tumorigenic PPARγ/RXRα pathway activation in luminal bladder tumors and may open the way towards alternative options for treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Protein-templated fragment ligations have been established as a powerful method for the assembly and detection of optimized protein ligands. Initially developed for reversible ligations, the method has been expanded to irreversible reactions enabling the formation of super-additive fragment combinations. Here, protein-induced Mannich ligations are discovered as a biocatalytic reaction furnishing inhibitors of the transcription factor STAT5. STAT5 protein catalyzes multicomponent reactions of a phosphate mimetic, formaldehyde, and 1H-tetrazoles yielding protein ligands with greatly increased binding affinity and ligand efficiency. Reactions are induced under physiological conditions selectively by native STAT5 but not by other proteins. Formation of ligation products and (auto-)inhibition of the reaction are quantified and the mechanism is investigated. Inhibitors assembled by STAT5 block specifically the phosphorylation of this protein in a cellular model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DNA-binding of STAT5 dimers, expression of downstream targets of the transcription factor, and the proliferation of cancer cells in mice. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum dots (QDs) are fundamentally interesting because of the stronger quantum size effect with decreased lateral dimensions relative to their larger 2D nanosheet counterparts. However, the preparation of a wide range of TMD QDs is still a continual challenge. Here we demonstrate a bottom-up strategy utilizing TM oxides or chlorides and chalcogen precursors to synthesize a small library of TMD QDs (MoS 2 , WS 2 , RuS 2 , MoTe 2 , MoSe 2 , WSe 2 and RuSe 2 ). The reaction reaches equilibrium almost instantaneously (~10–20 s) with mild aqueous and room temperature conditions. Tunable defect engineering can be achieved within the same reactions by deviating the precursors’ reaction stoichiometries from their fixed molecular stoichiometries. Using MoS 2 QDs for proof-of-concept biomedical applications, we show that increasing sulfur defects enhanced oxidative stress generation, through the photodynamic effect, in cancer cells. This facile strategy will motivate future design of TMDs nanomaterials utilizing defect engineering for biomedical applications. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Relation between oncological diseases and venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is well known for almost 2 centuries. In 1823 Bouillaud assumed by three patients with tumor and recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), that peripheral edema of lower limbs emerges as a result of &#8222;obturation&#8220; of veins by &#8222;fibrinous coagulum&#8220; (caillot fibrineux), which was induced by oncological disease. French physician Armand Trousseau wrote about this relation in his book &#8222;Phlegmasia alba dolens&#8221; again in the year 1865. Many studies were developed in times of Bouillaud a Trousseau, which just confirmed existence of relation between tumor and VTE. Oncological disease presents a significant risk factor of formation of VTE. Recent references favorising the use of light molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in long-term anticoagulation therapy of patients with cancer. Recently we have just few clinical data about efficiency and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in oncological patients, however many meta-analysis of clinical studies has shown benefit of therapy with DOACs towards conventional therapy. Key words: direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) - oncology - venous thromboembolism.",

    "Abstract": "Oncology patients undergoing cancer treatment experience an average of fifteen unrelieved symptoms that are highly variable in both their severity and distress. Recent advances in Network Analysis (NA) provide a novel approach to gain insights into the complex nature of co-occurring symptoms and symptom clusters and identify core symptoms. We present findings from the first study that used NA to examine the relationships among 38 common symptoms in a large sample of oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. Using two different models of Pairwise Markov Random Fields (PMRF), we examined the nature and structure of interactions for three different dimensions of patients’ symptom experience (i.e., occurrence, severity, distress). Findings from this study provide the first direct evidence that the connections between and among symptoms differ depending on the symptom dimension used to create the network. Based on an evaluation of the centrality indices, nausea appears to be a structurally important node in all three networks. Our findings can be used to guide the development of symptom management interventions based on the identification of core symptoms and symptom clusters within a network. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bcl9 and Pygo are Wnt enhanceosome components that effect β-catenin-dependent transcription. Whether they mediate β-catenin-dependent neoplasia is unclear. Here we assess their roles in intestinal tumourigenesis initiated by Apc loss-of-function (Apc Min ), or by Apc 1322T encoding a partially-functional Apc truncation commonly found in colorectal carcinomas. Intestinal deletion of Bcl9 extends disease-free survival in both models, and essentially cures Apc 1322T mice of their neoplasia. Loss-of-Bcl9 synergises with loss-of-Pygo to shift gene expression within Apc-mutant adenomas from stem cell-like to differentiation along Notch-regulated secretory lineages. Bcl9 loss also promotes tumour retention in Apc Min mice, apparently via relocating nuclear β-catenin to the cell surface, but this undesirable effect is not seen in Apc 1322T mice whose Apc truncation retains partial function in regulating β-catenin. Our results demonstrate a key role of the Wnt enhanceosome in β-catenin-dependent intestinal tumourigenesis and reveal the potential of BCL9 as a therapeutic target during early stages of colorectal cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Telomeres are special DNA-protein structures that are located at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. The telomere length determines the proliferation potential of cells. Telomerase is a key component of the telomere length maintenance system. While telomerase is inactive in the majority of somatic cells, its activity determines the clonogenic potential of stem cells as a resource for tissue and organism regeneration. Reactivation of telomerase occurs during the process of immortalization in the majority of cancer cells. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that contains telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomerase RNA components. The RNA processing mechanism of telomerase involves exosome trimming or degradation of the primary precursor. Recent data provide evidence that the competition between the processing and decay of telomerase RNA may regulate the amount of RNA at the physiological level. We show that termination of human telomerase RNA transcription is dependent on its promoter, which engages with the multisubunit complex Integrator to interact with RNA polymerase II and terminate transcription of the human telomerase RNA gene followed by further processing. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hematopoietic chimerism after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may establish a state of donor antigen-specific tolerance. However, current allotransplantation protocols involve genotoxic conditioning which has harmful side-effects and predisposes to infection and cancer. Here we describe a non-genotoxic conditioning protocol for fully MHC-mismatched bone marrow allotransplantation in mice involving transient immunosuppression and selective depletion of recipient hematopoietic stem cells with a CD117-antibody-drug-conjugate (ADC). This protocol resulted in multilineage, high level (up to 50%), durable, donor-derived hematopoietic chimerism after transplantation of 20 million total bone marrow cells, compared with ≤ 2.1% hematopoietic chimerism from 50 million total bone marrow cells without conditioning. Moreover, long-term survival of bone marrow donor-type but not third party skin allografts is achieved in CD117-ADC-conditioned chimeric mice without chronic immunosuppression. The only observed adverse event is transient elevation of liver enzymes in the first week after conditioning. These results provide proof-of-principle for CD117-ADC as a non−genotoxic, highly-targeted conditioning agent in allotransplantation and tolerance protocols. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that allows for transferrin-bound iron uptake in mammalian cells. It is overexpressed in various cancers to satisfy the high iron demand of fast proliferating cells. Here we show that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) TFR1 expression is regulated by miR-148a. Within the TFR1 3′UTR we identified and experimentally validated two evolutionarily conserved miRNA response elements (MREs) for miR-148/152 family members, including miR-148a. Interestingly, analyses of RNA sequencing data from patients with liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) revealed a significant inverse correlation of TFR1 mRNA levels and miR-148a. In addition, TFR1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the tumor compared to matched normal healthy tissue, while miR-148a levels are decreased. Functional analysis demonstrated post-transcriptional regulation of TFR1 by miR-148a in HCC cells as well as decreased HCC cell proliferation upon either miR-148a overexpression or TFR1 knockdown. We hypothesize that decreased expression of miR-148a in HCC may elevate transferrin-bound iron uptake, increasing cellular iron levels and cell proliferation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Exhibiting a red-shifted absorption/scattering feature compared to conventional plasmonic metals, titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) look as very promising candidates for biomedical applications, but these applications are still underexplored despite the presence of extensive data for conventional plasmonic counterparts. Here, we report the fabrication of ultrapure, size-tunable TiN NPs by methods of femtosecond laser ablation in liquids and their biological testing. We show that TiN NPs demonstrate strong and broad plasmonic peak around 640–700 nm with a significant tail over 800 nm even for small NPs sizes (<7 nm). In vitro tests of laser-synthesized TiN NPs on cellular models evidence their low cytotoxicity and excellent cell uptake. We finally demonstrate a strong photothermal therapy effect on U87–MG cancer cell cultures using TiN NPs as sensitizers of local hyperthermia under near-infrared laser excitation. Based on absorption band in the region of relative tissue transparency and acceptable biocompatibility, laser-synthesized TiN NPs promise the advancement of biomedical modalities employing plasmonic effects, including absorption/scattering contrast imaging, photothermal therapy, photoacoustic imaging and SERS. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "EGFR is an oncogene that encodes for a trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor. Its mis-regulation is associated to several human cancers that, consistently, can be treated by selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The proximal promoter of EGFR contains a G-rich domain located at 272 bases upstream the transcription start site. We previously proved it folds into two main interchanging G-quadruplex structures, one of parallel and one of hybrid topology. Here we present the first evidences supporting the ability of the complementary C-rich strand (EGFR-272_C) to assume an intramolecular i-Motif (iM) structure that, according to the experimental conditions (pH, presence of co-solvent and salts), can coexist with a different arrangement we referred to as a hairpin. The herein identified iM efficiently competes with the canonical pairing of the two complementary strands, indicating it as a potential novel target for anticancer therapies. A preliminary screening for potential binders identified some phenanthroline derivatives as able to target EGFR-272_C at multiple binding sites when it is folded into an iM. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MLL3 and MLL4 are two closely related members of the SET1/MLL family of histone H3K4 methyltransferases and are responsible for monomethylating histone H3K4 on enhancers, which are essential in regulating cell-type-specific gene expression. Mutations of MLL3 or MLL4 have been reported in different types of cancer. Recently, the PHD domains of MLL3/4 have been reported to recruit the MLL3/4 complexes to their target genes by binding to histone H4 during the NT2/D1 stem cell differentiation. Here we show that an extended PHD domain (ePHD 6 ) involving the sixth PHD domain and its preceding zinc finger in MLL3 and MLL4 specifically recognizes an H4H18-containing histone H4 fragment and that modifications of residues surrounding H4H18 modulate H4 binding to MLL3/4. Our in vitro methyltransferase assays and cellular experiments further reveal that the interaction between ePHD 6 of MLL3/4 and histone H4 is required for their nucleosomal methylation activity and MLL4-mediated neuronal differentiation of NT2/D1 cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite recent biomedical improvements in treating Multiple Myeloma (MM), the disease still remains incurable. Toll like receptors (TLRs) provide a link between innate and adaptive immune responses and hence potentially correlate inflammation to cancer. Although the regulatory role of TLRs in MM has been under investigation the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we assayed the function of TLR4 in MM cell lines and in MM patients’ samples. We found that lipopolysaccharide-mediated TLR4 activation increased MM cells proliferation and decreased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed that either the endogenous CHOP expression or the ER stress-mediated CHOP induction, were suppressed by TLR4 activation or its overexpression in MM cell lines; TLR4 induction also suppressed ER stress-induced apoptotic signals. In support, TLR4 gene expression silencing in MM cell lines significantly decreased cell proliferation and promoted CHOP and ATF4 upregulation. TLR4 activation was also able to partially abrogate the effect of bortezomib in MM cell lines by suppressing PERK, ATF4 and phospho-eIF2A. We suggest that TLR4-mediated disruption of ER stress responses contributes to MM cells proliferation and suppresses ER-dependent death signals. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Superresolution microscopy offers the advantage of imaging biological structures within cells at the nano-scale. Here we apply two superresolution microscopy techniques, specifically 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), a type of single molecule localisation microscopy, to localise IRSp53 protein and its I-BAR domain in relation to F-actin within filopodia. IRSp53 generates dynamic (extending and retracting) filopodia 300 nm wide with a distinct gap between IRSp53 and F-actin. By contrast, protrusions induced by the I-BAR domain alone are non-dynamic measuring between 100–200 nm in width and exhibit a comparatively closer localisation of the I-BAR domain with the F-actin. The data suggest that IRSp53 membrane localisation is spatially segregated to the lateral edges of filopodia, in contrast to the I-BAR domain is uniformly distributed throughout the membranes of protrusions. Modeling of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) data suggests that a greater proportion of I-BAR domain is associated with membranes when compared to full length IRSp53. The significance of this new data relates to the role filopodia play in cell migration and its importance to cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) responsible for causing Kaposi sarcoma (KS), an opportunistic angioproliferative neoplasm is emerging rapidly. Despite this there is no permanent cure for this disease. The present study was aimed to design a multi-epitope based vaccine targeting the major glycoproteins of KSHV which plays an important role in the virus entry. After the application of rigorous immunoinformatics analysis and several immune filters, the multi-epitope vaccine was constructed, consisting of CD4, CD8 and IFN-γ inducing epitopes. Several physiochemical characteristics, allergenicity and antigenicity of the multi-epitope vaccine were analyzed in order to ensure its safety and immunogenicity. Further, the binding affinity and stability of the vaccine with Toll like receptor -9 (TLR-9) was analyzed by molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies. In addition, an in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a (+) vector. Such T-cell-based immunotherapies which leverage this mechanism could prove their potential against cancer. Further, the authors propose to test the present findings in the lab settings to ensure the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the presented vaccine which may help in controlling KSHV infection. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Whether patients with glioblastoma that contacts the ventricular-subventricular zone stem cell niche (VSVZ + GBM) have a distinct survival profile from VSVZ − GBM patients independent of other known predictors or molecular profiles is unclear. Using multivariate Cox analysis to adjust survival for widely-accepted predictors, hazard ratios (HRs) for overall (OS) and progression free (PFS) survival between VSVZ + GBM and VSVZ − GBM patients were calculated in 170 single-institution patients and 254 patients included in both The Cancer Genome (TCGA) and Imaging (TCIA) atlases. An adjusted, multivariable analysis revealed that VSVZ contact was independently associated with decreased survival in both datasets. TCGA molecular data analyses revealed that VSVZ contact by GBM was independent of mutational, DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein expression signatures in the bulk tumor. Therefore, while survival of GBM patients is independently stratified by VSVZ contact, with VSVZ + GBM patients displaying a poor prognosis, the VSVZ + GBMs do not possess a distinct molecular signature at the bulk sample level. Focused examination of the interplay between the VSVZ microenvironment and subsets of GBM cells proximal to this region is warranted. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Serine proteases have been implicated as key drivers and facilitators of lung cancer malignancy, and while these proteins represent straightforward targets for therapeutic inhibitors, identification of optimal points for intervention has been complicated by the complex networks in which these enzymes function. Here we implicate a signaling pathway consisting of PRSS3/mesotrypsin and kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) in lung adenocarcinoma malignancy. We show that elevated PRSS3/mesotrypsin expression is prognostic for poor outcome for patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and that genetic or pharmacologic targeting of PRSS3/mesotrypsin reduces lung adenocarcinoma cell invasiveness and proliferation. We further show that genetic targeting of KLK5, a known target of PRSS3/mesotrypsin, phenocopies the effect of PRSS3/mesotrypsin knockdown, and also that elevated expression of KLK5 is similarly prognostic for outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, we use transcriptional profiling experiments to show that PRSS3/mesotrypsin and KLK5 control a common malignancy-promoting pathway. These experiments implicate a potential PRSS3/mesotrypsin-KLK5 signaling module in lung adenocarcinoma and reveal the potential therapeutic benefit of selectively targeting these pathways. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Blood transfusions temporarily improve the physical state of the patient but exert widespread effects on immune and non-immune systems. Perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions (ABT) are associated with various risks, including coagulopathy, incompatibility, transmission of infectious agents, and allergic reactions. Nevertheless, little is known about the global metabolic alterations that reflect the possible reactions of blood transfusions. In this study, we investigated metabolite changes generated by ABT in a rat model using metabolomics technology. To further profile the “metabolome” after blood transfusions, we used both liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight high-definition mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. ABT promoted a stimulatory microenvironment associated with a relative increase in glucose transporter 1/4 (GLUT1/GLUT4) expression. Supporting this result, glucose metabolism-related enzyme IRS1 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were abnormally expressed, and levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and its related enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) were significantly altered in allogeneic groups compared to those in autologous groups. Finally, amino acid metabolism was also altered following ABT. Taken together, our results show a difference between autologous and allogeneic blood transfusions and demonstrate correlations with cancer-associated metabolic changes. Our data provide endogenous information for a better understanding of blood transfusion reactions. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "CDC25 phosphatases play a key role in cell cycle transitions and are important targets for cancer therapy. Here, we set out to discover novel CDC25 inhibitors. Using a combination of computational methods, we defined a minimal common pharmacophore in established CDC25 inhibitors and performed virtual screening of a proprietary library. Based on the availability of crystal structures for CDC25A and CDC25B, we implemented a molecular docking strategy and carried out hit expansion/optimization. Enzymatic assays revealed that naphthoquinone scaffolds were the most promising CDC25 inhibitors among selected hits. At the molecular level, the compounds acted through a mixed-type mechanism of inhibition of phosphatase activity, involving reversible oxidation of cysteine residues. In 2D cell cultures, the compounds caused arrest of the cell cycle at the G1/S or at the G2/M transition. Mitotic markers analysis and time-lapse microscopy confirmed that CDK1 activity was impaired and that mitotic arrest was followed by death. Finally, the compounds induced differentiation, accompanied by decreased stemness properties, in intestinal crypt stem cell-derived Apc/K-Ras-mutant mouse organoids, and led to tumor regression and reduction of metastatic potential in zebrafish embryo xenografts used as in vivo model. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "First-order radiomic features, such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), are associated with disease progression in early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We hypothesized that a model incorporating first- and second-order radiomic features would more accurately predict outcome than MTV or TLG alone. We assessed whether radiomic features extracted from baseline PET scans predicted relapsed or refractory disease status in a cohort of 251 patients with stage I-II HL who were managed at a tertiary cancer center. Models were developed and tested using a machine-learning algorithm. Features extracted from mediastinal sites were highly predictive of primary refractory disease. A model incorporating 5 of the most predictive features had an area under the curve (AUC) of 95.2% and total error rate of 1.8%. By comparison, the AUC was 78% for both MTV and TLG and was 65% for maximum standardize uptake value (SUV max ). Furthermore, among the patients with refractory mediastinal disease, our model distinguished those who were successfully salvaged from those who ultimately died of HL. We conclude that our PET radiomic model may improve upfront stratification of early-stage HL patients with mediastinal disease and thus contribute to risk-adapted, individualized management. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glucose plays a crucial role in the mammalian cell metabolism. In the erythrocytes and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier, glucose uptake is mediated by the glucose transporter type 1 (GluT1). GluT1 deficiency or mutations cause severe physiological disorders. GluT1 is also an important target in cancer therapy as it is overexpressed in tumor cells. Previous studies have suggested that GluT1 mediates solute transfer through a cycle of conformational changes. However, the corresponding 3D structures adopted by the transporter during the transfer process remain elusive. In the present work, we first elucidate the whole conformational landscape of GluT1 in the absence of glucose, using long molecular dynamics simulations and show that the transitions can be accomplished through thermal fluctuations. Importantly, we highlight a strong coupling between intracellular and extracellular domains of the protein that contributes to the transmembrane helices reorientation during the transition. The conformations adopted during the simulations differ from the known 3D bacterial homologs structures resolved in similar states. In holo state simulations, we find that glucose transits along the pathway through significant rotational motions, while maintaining hydrogen bonds with the protein. These persistent motions affect side chains orientation, which impacts protein mechanics and allows glucose progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A reliable and highly sensitive hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) field effect transistor (FET) sensor is reported, which was constructed by using molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 )/reduced graphene oxide (RGO). In this work, we prepared MoS 2 nanosheets by a simple liquid ultrasonication exfoliation method. After the RGO-based FET device was fabricated, MoS 2 was assembled onto the RGO surface for constructing MoS 2 /RGO FET sensor. The as-prepared FET sensor showed an ultrahigh sensitivity and fast response toward H 2 O 2 in a real-time monitoring manner with a limit of detection down to 1 pM. In addition, the constructed sensor also exhibited a high specificity toward H 2 O 2 in complex biological matrix. More importantly, this novel biosensor was capable of monitoring of H 2 O 2 released from HeLa cells in real-time. So far, this is the first report of MoS 2 /RGO based FET sensor for electrical detection of signal molecules directly from cancer cells. Hence it is promising as a new platform for the clinical diagnosis of H 2 O 2 -related diseases. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Sea spray aerosols (SSAs) have profound effects on our climate and ecosystems. They also contain microbiota and biogenic molecules which could affect human health. Yet the exposure and effects of SSAs on human health remain poorly studied. Here, we exposed human lung cancer cells to extracts of a natural sea spray aerosol collected at the seashore in Belgium, a laboratory-generated SSA, the marine algal toxin homoyessotoxin and a chemical inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We observed significant increased expression of genes related to the mTOR pathway and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) after exposure to homoyessotoxin and the laboratory-generated SSA. In contrast, we observed a significant decrease in gene expression in the mTOR pathway and of PCSK9 after exposure to the natural SSA and the mTOR inhibitor, suggesting induction of apoptosis. Our results indicate that marine biogenics in SSAs interact with PCSK9 and the mTOR pathway and can be used in new potential pharmaceutical applications. Overall, our results provide a substantial molecular evidence base for potential beneficial health effects at environmentally relevant concentrations of natural SSAs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Type II alveolar cells are highly robust in nature, yet susceptible to aerosolized nanoparticles (NPs). Dysfunction in these specialized cells, can often lead to emphysema, edema, and pulmonary inflammation. Long-time exposure can also lead to dangerous epigenetic modifications and cancer. Among the manufactured nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles are widely encountered owing to their wide range of applications. Scores of published literatures affirm ZnO NPs are more toxic to human alveolar cells than TiO 2 . However, signalling cascades deducing differences in human alveolar responses to their exposure is not well documented. With A549 cells, we have demonstrated that epithelial to mesenchymal transition and an increased duration of phosphorylation of eIF2α are crucial mechanisms routing better tolerance to TiO 2 NP treatment over exposure to ZnO. The increased migratory capacity may help cells escape away from the zone of stress. Further, expression of chaperone such as Hsp70 is also enhanced during the same dose-time investigations. This is the first report of its kind. These novel findings could be successfully developed in the future to design relief strategies to alleviate metal oxide nanoparticle mediated stress. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Osteosarcomas are characterized by highly disrupted genomes. Although osteosarcomas lack common fusions, we find evidence of many tumour specific gene-gene fusion transcripts, likely due to chromosomal rearrangements and expression of transcription-induced chimeras. Most of the fusions result in out-of-frame transcripts, potentially capable of producing long novel protein sequences and a plethora of neoantigens. To identify fusions, we explored RNA-sequencing data to obtain detailed knowledge of transcribed fusions, by creating a novel program to compare fusions identified by deFuse to de novo transcripts generated by Trinity. This allowed us to confirm the deFuse results and identify unusual splicing patterns associated with fusion events. Using various existing tools combined with this custom program, we developed a pipeline for the identification of fusion transcripts applicable as targets for immunotherapy. In addition to identifying candidate neoantigens associated with fusions, we were able to use the pipeline to establish a method for measuring the frequency of fusion events, which correlated to patient outcome, as well as highlight some similarities between canine and human osteosarcomas. The results of this study of osteosarcomas underscores the numerous benefits associated with conducting a thorough analysis of fusion events within cancer samples. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Capecitabine (CAP) is an FDA-approved and frequently used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of various cancers. However, there are some side effects and chemoresistance limiting its use. Nanotechnological approaches can enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs. In this study, CAP-loaded nanoniosomes were prepared. Nanoniosomes were prepared by the method of thin film hydration wherein CAP was loaded into the nanoniosomes. Nanoniosomes were then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and (particle) vesicle size analysis. The cytotoxicity effect of the nanoniosomes were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. CAP was loaded into the nanoniosomes and loading capacity and entrapment efficiency were determined. The vesicle size of the nanoniosomes was obtained in the nanometer scale, and CAP release profiles from the nanoniosomes were also obtained. Finally, the cytotoxicity effect of CAP and CAP-loaded nanoniosomes were evaluated toward MCF7 and PANC1 cell lines. The nanoniosomes with an amphipathic structure can penetrate into the cells with an enhanced release rate. These caused the toxicity of drug in the nanoniosomes to be higher than the free drug.",

In this study we demonstrate for the first time that smoking status can be predicted using blood biochemistry and cell count results andthe recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By employing age-prediction models developed using supervised deep learning techniques, we found that smokers exhibited higher aging rates than nonsmokers, regardless of their cholesterol ratios and fasting glucose levels. We further used those models to quantify the acceleration of biological aging due to tobacco use. Female smokers were predicted to be twice as old as their chronological age compared to nonsmokers, whereas male smokers were predicted to be one and a half times as old as their chronological age compared to nonsmokers. Our findings suggest that deep learning analysis of routine blood tests could complement or even replace the current error-prone method of self-reporting of smoking status and could be expanded to assess the effect of other lifestyle and environmental factors on aging. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), also known as squalene monooxygenase, catalyzes the stereospecific conversion of squalene to 2,3(S)-oxidosqualene, a key step in cholesterol biosynthesis. SQLE inhibition is targeted for the treatment of hypercholesteremia, cancer, and fungal infections. However, lack of structure-function understanding has hindered further progression of its inhibitors. We have determined the first three-dimensional high-resolution crystal structures of human SQLE catalytic domain with small molecule inhibitors (2.3 Å and 2.5 Å). Comparison with its unliganded state (3.0 Å) reveals conformational rearrangements upon inhibitor binding, thus allowing deeper interpretation of known structure-activity relationships. We use the human SQLE structure to further understand the specificity of terbinafine, an approved agent targeting fungal SQLE, and to provide the structural insights into terbinafine-resistant mutants encountered in the clinic. Collectively, these findings elucidate the structural basis for the specificity of the epoxidation reaction catalyzed by SQLE and enable further rational development of next-generation inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Neurovascular coupling, cerebrovascular remodeling and hemodynamic changes are critical to brain function, and dysregulated in neuropathologies such as brain tumors. Interrogating these phenomena in freely behaving animals requires a portable microscope with multiple optical contrast mechanisms. Therefore, we developed a miniaturized microscope with: a fluorescence (FL) channel for imaging neural activity (e.g., GCaMP) or fluorescent cancer cells (e.g., 9L-GFP); an intrinsic optical signal (IOS) channel for imaging hemoglobin absorption (i.e., cerebral blood volume); and a laser speckle contrast (LSC) channel for imaging perfusion (i.e., cerebral blood flow). Following extensive validation, we demonstrate the microscope’s capabilities via experiments in unanesthetized murine brains that include: (i) multi-contrast imaging of neurovascular changes following auditory stimulation; (ii) wide-area tonotopic mapping; (iii) EEG-synchronized imaging during anesthesia recovery; and (iv) microvascular connectivity mapping over the life-cycle of a brain tumor. This affordable, flexible, plug-and-play microscope heralds a new era in functional imaging of freely behaving animals. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Clinical data acquired over the last decade on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment with small molecular weight Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have shown significant influence of EGFR point mutations and in-frame deletions on clinical efficacy. Identification of small molecules capable of inhibiting the clinically relevant EGFR mutant forms is desirable, and novel chemical scaffolds might provide knowledge regarding selectivity among EGFR forms and shed light on new strategies to overcome current clinical limitations. Design, synthesis, docking studies and in vitro evaluation of N-(3-(3-phenylureido)quinoxalin-6-yl) acrylamide derivatives (7a-m) against EGFR mutant forms are described. Compounds 7h and 7l were biochemically active in the nanomolar range against EGFRwt and EGFRL858R. Molecular docking and reaction enthalpy calculations have shown the influence of the combination of reversible and covalent binding modes with EGFR on the inhibitory activity. The inhibitory profile of 7h against a panel of patient-derived tumor cell lines was established, demonstrating selective growth inhibition of EGFR related cells at 10 μM among a panel of 30 cell lines derived from colon, melanoma, breast, bladder, kidney, prostate, pancreas and ovary tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Patients with cancer during their chemotherapy period are more at risk for nutritional problems and weight loss due to oral problems. Over the years, oral care protocols and mouthwashes have been developed to control this problem. Recently, in some studies, the effect of oral care programs and honey on the nutritional status of patients under chemotherapy has been studied. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of honey mouthwash and an oral care protocol on weight loss in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: In this single-blind clinical trial, sixty patients with AML under chemotherapy admitted to Ghazi Tabatabaee hospital of Tabriz, Iran were selected with convenience sampling and were randomly assigned into three groups: honey mouthwash (n=20) and oral care (n=20) and a control group (n=20). In addition to routine care, patients in the oral care group received twice daily toothbrush, dental floss was used once a day and normal saline mouthwash, and in the honey group, honey mouthwash was used four times a day for 30 seconds (honey to water ratio 1:20). The weight of patients was measured using a digital scale at baseline and at 4 weeks follow-up (4 times). Results: The trend of weight changes in the control group was decreasing; in the honey mouthwash group, after the first week was ascending, and in the oral care group, it was almost constant.Importantly,comparison of mean weight in the study groups during the first and second weeks was not significant (p>0.05) but at the end of the third week, the difference of mean weight of the patients in the honey and control group (p=0.039) and at the end of the week in the honey and control group (p=0.001) and honey and oral care (p=0.04) were significant. The effect of intervention of honey mouthwash was significant over time (p<0.01). Conclusion: The results of the study showed that honey mouthwash improved the weight of patients during the stay, while this trend was reversed in the other two groups. Considering the effectiveness of honey mouthwash and easy use, the using this mouthwash with oral hygiene education is recommended to improve nutritional indices of patients in cancer care units. © 2019, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Background: The US EPA considers glyphosate as “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.” The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A).” EPA asserts that there is no convincing evidence that “glyphosate induces mutations in vivo via the oral route.” IARC concludes there is “strong evidence” that exposure to glyphosate is genotoxic through at least two mechanisms known to be associated with human carcinogens (DNA damage, oxidative stress). Why and how did EPA and IARC reach such different conclusions? Results: A total of 52 genotoxicity assays done by registrants were cited by the EPA in its 2016 evaluation of technical glyphosate, and another 52 assays appeared in the public literature. Of these, one regulatory assay (2%) and 35 published assays (67%) reported positive evidence of a genotoxic response. In the case of formulated, glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), 43 regulatory assays were cited by EPA, plus 65 assays published in peer-reviewed journals. Of these, none of the regulatory, and 49 published assays (75%) reported evidence of a genotoxic response following exposure to a GBH. IARC considered a total of 118 genotoxicity assays in six core tables on glyphosate technical, GBHs, and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), glyphosate’s primary metabolite. EPA’s analysis encompassed 51 of these 118 assays (43%). In addition, IARC analyzed another 81 assays exploring other possible genotoxic mechanisms (mostly related to sex hormones and oxidative stress), of which 62 (77%) reported positive results. IARC placed considerable weight on three positive GBH studies in exposed human populations, whereas EPA placed little or no weight on them. Conclusions: EPA and IARC reached diametrically opposed conclusions on glyphosate genotoxicity for three primary reasons: (1) in the core tables compiled by EPA and IARC, the EPA relied mostly on registrant-commissioned, unpublished regulatory studies, 99% of which were negative, while IARC relied mostly on peer-reviewed studies of which 70% were positive (83 of 118); (2) EPA’s evaluation was largely based on data from studies on technical glyphosate, whereas IARC’s review placed heavy weight on the results of formulated GBH and AMPA assays; (3) EPA’s evaluation was focused on typical, general population dietary exposures assuming legal, food-crop uses, and did not take into account, nor address generally higher occupational exposures and risks. IARC’s assessment encompassed data from typical dietary, occupational, and elevated exposure scenarios. More research is needed on real-world exposures to the chemicals within formulated GBHs and the biological fate and consequences of such exposures. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Berry fruits have attracted attention because of their purported benefits for aging, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Therefore, highly priced berry fruits might be targets for food adulteration and fraud. In this study, eight species-specific primer sets based on the single nucleotide polymorphism of the chloroplast genomes of four berry fruits (aronia, blackberry, cranberry, and strawberry) were developed for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis by SYBR Green staining with the aim of preventing berry fruit food fraud. The developed primer pairs exhibited high efficiencies ranging from 88 to 110% with strong correlation coefficients (R 2 &gt; 0.99) for the amplification of each target species. However, no clear correlation coefficients were evident for non-target species. To evaluate the practicality of the developed primers, 18 commercial berry fruit products were verified by qPCR analysis. The developed primer pairs were amplified to a low C t value (range 16.1–23.3) for the target species and proved capable of detecting target species in berry fruit commercial foods. Therefore, the developed qPCR-based species-specific markers could be suitable for the prevention of berry fruit food fraud and to verify marker reliability. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "SOX6 is a HMG-box transcription factor expressed in a wide range of tissues. Recent data show that SOX6 expression is altered in different cancers, in the majority of cases being downregulated. To date, no data are available about SOX6 role in hematological malignancies. Here we demonstrate that SOX6 overexpressing BCR-ABL1 + B-ALL cells are unable to promote leukemia in a mouse model. Starting from this observation, we extended our study to a panel of human leukemic cells carrying genetic lesions distinctive of different types of leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders (the BCR-ABL1 translocation and the JAK2V617F amino acid substitution) to dissect the cellular events induced by SOX6. The inhibition of proliferation is the invariant outcome of SOX6 overexpression but it is achieved via two different cellular responses: terminal differentiation in erythroid-biased cells, irrespectively of their mutation, and apoptosis in megakaryocytic-primed and lymphoid cells. Within this context, cells carrying the highest copy number of the JAK2V617F allele better counteract the SOX6-imposed growth arrest. The interrogation of the GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) human dataset reveals that SOX6 is downregulated in a cohort of AML patients, uncovering a wide anti-proliferative role of SOX6 in a variety of mutant backgrounds. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Enterobacteriaceae are among the first colonizers of neonate intestine. Members of this family, such as Escherichia and Klebsiella, are considered pathobionts and as such are capable of inducing local and systemic disease under specific colonization circumstances. Interplay between developing microbiota and pathogenic function of pathobionts are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the functional interaction between various colonization patterns on an early colonizer, K. pneumoniae. K. pneumoniae 51-5 was isolated from stool of a healthy, premature infant, and found to contain the genotoxin island pks associated with development of colorectal cancer. Using intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, and primary splenocytes, we demonstrate K. pneumoniae 51-5 upregulates expression of proinflammatory genes in vitro. Gnotobiotic experiments in Il10 −/− mice demonstrate the neonate isolate induces intestinal inflammation in vivo, with increased expression of proinflammatory genes. Regulation of microbiota assembly revealed K. pneumoniae 51-5 accelerates onset of inflammation in Il10 −/− mice, most significantly when microbiota is naturally acquired. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae 51-5 induces DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, K. pneumoniae 51-5 induced tumors in Apc Min/+ ; Il10 −/− mice was not significantly affected by absence of colibactin activating enzyme, ClbP. These findings demonstrate pathogenicity of infant K. pneumoniae isolate is sensitive to microbial colonization status. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The development of mucoadhesive in situ gelling formulations for intravesical application may improve the therapeutic outcomes of bladder cancer patients. In this work, chitosan/β-glycerophosphate (CHIGP) thermosensitive formulations have been prepared using three different chitosan grades (62, 124 and 370 kDa). Their ability to form in situ gelling systems triggered by changes in temperature upon administration to urinary bladder were evaluated using vial inversion and rheological methods. Texture analysis was used to study their mucoadhesive properties as well as syringeability through the urethral catheter. The retention of CHIGP formulations, with fluorescein sodium as the model drug, was studied on porcine urinary bladder mucosa ex vivo using the flow-through technique and fluorescent microscopy. CHIGP formulations containing mitomycin-C were prepared and drug release was studied using in vitro dialysis method. It was established that the molecular weight of chitosan influenced the thermogelling, mucoadhesive and drug release behaviour of the in situ gelling delivery systems. Formulations prepared from chitosan with greatest molecular weight (370 kDa) were found to be the most promising for intravesical application due to their superior gelling properties and in vitro retention in the bladder. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase I (DGAT1) is a key enzyme in lipogenesis which is increased in metabolically active cells to meet nutrient requirements. DGAT1 has been recognized as an anti-obesity target; however, its role in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. We postulated that, in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, augmented lipogenesis and growth are due to increased DGAT1 expression leading to microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) amplification. Thus, therapeutic targeting of DGAT1 potentially has tumor suppressive activity. We tested whether blocking DGAT1 in PCa cells altered MTOC and lipid signaling. Western blot and immunofluorescence were performed for MTOC and triglyceride mediators. Treatment with a DGAT1 inhibitor was evaluated. We found a stepwise increase in DGAT1 protein levels when comparing normal prostate epithelial cells to PCa cells, LNCaP and PC-3. Lipid droplets, MTOCs, and microtubule-regulating proteins were reduced in tumor cells treated with a DGAT1 inhibitor. Depletion of the non-centrosomal MTOC protein GM130 reduced PCa cell proliferation and migration. Inhibition of DGAT1 reduced tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, and a negative feedback loop was discovered between DGAT1, PEDF, and GM130. These data identify DGAT1 as a promising new target for suppressing PCa growth by regulating GM130, MTOC number and disrupting microtubule integrity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite the increased interest in secretomes associated with paracrine/autocrine mechanisms, the majority of mass spectrometric cell secretome studies have been performed using serum-free medium (SFM). On the other hand, serum-containing medium (SCM) is not recommended very much because the secretome obtained with SCM is easily contaminated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) proteins. In this study, through the combination of bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) and pulsed-SILAC (pSILAC), we analyzed differentially secreted proteins between SFM and SCM in a cancer-derived human cell, U87MG, and a mesenchymal stem cell derived from human Wharton’s jelly (hWJ-MSCs). In most cases, the bioinformatic tools predicted a protein to be truly secretory when the secretion level of the protein was more in SCM than in SFM. In the case of hWJ-MSCs, the amount of proteins secreted in SCM for 24 hours was larger than that of SFM (log 2 fold change = 0.96), even considering different cell proliferation rates. hWJ-MSCs proteins secreted more in SCM included several positive markers of MSC paracrine factors implicated in angiogenesis, neurogenesis and osteogenesis, and upstream regulators of cell proliferation. Our study suggests the analysis of the secretome should be processed in SCM that promotes cell proliferation and secretion. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A new Streptomyces species discovered from Sarawak mangrove soil is described, with the proposed name – Streptomyces monashensis sp. nov. (strain MUSC 1J T ). Taxonomy status of MUSC 1J T was determined via polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic properties of strain MUSC 1J T were in accordance with those known for genus Streptomyces. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the strains closely related to MUSC 1J T were Streptomyces corchorusii DSM 40340 T (98.7%), Streptomyces olivaceoviridis NBRC 13066 T (98.7%), Streptomyces canarius NBRC 13431 T (98.6%) and Streptomyces coacervatus AS-0823 T (98.4%). Outcomes of DNA–DNA relatedness between strain MUSC 1J T and its closely related type strains covered from 19.7 ± 2.8% to 49.1 ± 4.3%. Strain MUSC 1J T has genome size of 10,254,857 bp with DNA G + C content of 71 mol%. MUSC 1J T extract exhibited strong antioxidative activity up to 83.80 ± 4.80% in the SOD assay, with significant cytotoxic effect against colon cancer cell lines HCT-116 and SW480. Streptomyces monashensis MUSC 1J T (=DSM 103626 T = MCCC 1K03221 T ) could potentially be a producer of novel bioactive metabolites; hence discovery of this new species may be highly significant to the biopharmaceutical industry as it could lead to development of new and useful chemo-preventive drugs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Syntaxin 6 is a SNARE family protein known to play an important role in intracellular trafficking. Here, we examined the tumorogenic role of syntaxin 6 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was queried for clinicopathologic data and syntaxin 6 expression. We found a significant difference in overall survival (OS) between groups, with high syntaxin 6 expression correlating with decreased survival. When stratifying the data based on histological subtype, the papillary RCC subtype exhibited a significant correlation between syntaxin 6 expression and survival. Using ROC curve, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) to determine the ability of syntaxin 6 to predict 3-year overall survival. The AUC for syntaxin 6 was 0.73, significantly higher compared to 0.52 for T stage. Next, syntaxin 6 expression was evaluated in clear cell (786-O and Caki-1) and papillary (Caki-2 and ACHN) RCC cells. Syntaxin 6 expression was higher in Caki-1 and ACHN RCC cells. Silencing of syntaxin 6 in ACHN cells significantly decreased the cell viability (p < 0.001). Overall, syntaxin 6 could be a prognostic biomarker for patients with papillary RCC and syntaxin 6 inhibitors hold promise as a novel therapy against RCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes are characterized by distinct molecular profiles. Using RNA expression profiles from 1,009 RCC samples, we constructed a condition-annotated gene coexpression network (GCN). The RCC GCN contains binary gene coexpression relationships (edges) specific to conditions including RCC subtype and tumor stage. As an application of this resource, we discovered RCC GCN edges and modules that were associated with genetic lesions in known RCC driver genes, including VHL, a common initiating clear cell RCC (ccRCC) genetic lesion, and PBRM1 and BAP1 which are early genetic lesions in the Braided Cancer River Model (BCRM). Since ccRCC tumors with PBRM1 mutations respond to targeted therapy differently than tumors with BAP1 mutations, we focused on ccRCC-specific edges associated with tumors that exhibit alternate mutation profiles: VHL-PBRM1 or VHL-BAP1. We found specific blends molecular functions associated with these two mutation paths. Despite these mutation-associated edges having unique genes, they were enriched for the same immunological functions suggesting a convergent functional role for alternate gene sets consistent with the BCRM. The condition annotated RCC GCN described herein is a novel data mining resource for the assignment of polygenic biomarkers and their relationships to RCC tumors with specific molecular and mutational profiles. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The crucial role of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling in the angiogenesis and metastasis of solid tumors has prompted the development of inhibitors with minimal bystander effects. Recently, Adnectin C has attracted attention for cancer treatment. To overcome the problematic properties of Adnectin, a novel form of Adnectin C has been designed by its fusion to a biodegradable polymeric peptide containing Pro/Ala/Ser (PAS) repetitive residues. E. coli-expressed recombinant fused and unfused proteins were compared in terms of bioactivity, physicochemical, and pharmacokinetic properties using standard methods. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis of PASylated adnectin C revealed an approximate 2-fold increase in particle size with a slight change in the net charge. Additionally, fusion of the PAS sequence improved its stability against the growth of thermo-induced aggregated forms. The high receptor-binding and improved binding kinetic parameters of PASylated Adnectin C was confirmed by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance assays, respectively. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a noticeable increase in the terminal half-life of Adnectin C-PAS#1(200) by a factor of 4.57 after single dose by intravenous injection into female BALB/c mice. The results suggest that PASylation could offer a superior delivery strategy for developing Adnectin-derived drugs with improved patient compliance. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests a potential role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels in inflammatory and cancer-related pain. However, the role of TRPV1 in the maintenance of neuropathic pain remains elusive. The current study investigated the effects of transient Trpv1 gene silencing using a small interference RNA (siRNA) on neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats. Seven days after CCI, the TRPV1 siRNA was intrathecally administered (5 µg/15 µl, once daily for 2 days). TRPV1 and Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in the spinal cord were detected using western blotting. The thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli were determined before and after intrathecal TRPV1 siRNA administration. TRPV1 and CAMKII expression and ERK2 phosphorylation in the spinal cord were upregulated after CCI. Intrathecal administration of the TRPV1 siRNA not only attenuated behavioural hyperalgesia but also reduced the expression of TRPV1 and CAMKII, as well as ERK2 phosphorylation. Based on these results, silencing of the TRPV1 gene in the spinal cord attenuates the maintenance of neuropathic pain by inhibiting CAMKII/ERK2 activation and suggests that TRPV1 represents a potential target in pain therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly metastatic cancer with very poor prognosis. AMP activated kinase (AMPK) constitutes a candidate to inhibit HCC progression. First, AMPK is downregulated in HCC. Second, glucose starvation induces apoptosis in HCC cells via AMPK. Correspondingly, metformin activates AMPK and inhibits HCC cell proliferation. Nevertheless, the effect of AMPK activation on HCC cell invasiveness remains elusive. Here, migration/invasion was studied in HCC cells exposed to metformin and glucose starvation. Cell viability, proliferation and differentiation, as well as AMPK and PKA activation were analyzed. In addition, invasiveness in mutants of the AMPKα activation loop was assessed. Metformin decreased cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and interference with AMPKα expression avoided metformin actions. Those antitumor effects were potentiated by glucose deprivation. Metformin activated AMPK at the same time that inhibited PKA, and both effects were enhanced by glucose starvation. Given that AMPKα(S173) phosphorylation by PKA decreases AMPK activation, we hypothesized that the reduction of PKA inhibitory effect by metformin could explain the increased antitumor effects observed. Supporting this, in AMPK activating conditions, cell migration/invasion was further impaired in AMPKα(S173C) mutant cells. Metformin emerges as a strong inhibitor of migration/invasion in HCC cells, and glucose restriction potentiates this effect. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Digital PCR (dPCR) has been developed as a method that can quantify nucleic acids more sensitively than real-time PCR. However, dPCR exhibits large fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity of the compartment, resulting in low accuracy. The main cause is most likely due to insufficient PCR. In this study, we proposed a new method that combines dPCR with melting curve analysis and applied that method to KRAS genotyping. Since the melting temperature (Tm) of the PCR product hardly depends on the amplification efficiency, genotyping accuracy is improved by using the Tm value. The results showed that the peaks of the distribution of the Tm values of DNA in the wells were 68.7, 66.3, and 62.6 °C for wild-type KRAS, the G12R mutant, and the G12D mutant, respectively, and the standard deviation of the Tm values was 0.2 °C for each genotype. This result indicates that the proposed method is capable of discriminating between the wild-type sequence and the two mutants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the genotyping of single mutations by combining melting curve analysis and dPCR. The application of this approach could be useful for the quantification and genotyping of cancer-related genes in low-abundance samples. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Angiogenic sprouting can contribute adaptively, or mal-adaptively, to a myriad of conditions including ischemic heart disease and cancer. While the cellular and molecular systems that regulate tip versus stalk endothelial cell (EC) specification during angiogenesis are known, those systems that regulate their distinct actions remain poorly understood. Pre-clinical and clinical findings support sustained adrenergic signaling in promoting angiogenesis, but links between adrenergic signaling and angiogenesis are lacking; importantly, adrenergic agents alter the activation status of the cAMP signaling system. Here, we show that the cAMP effector, PKA, acts in a cell autonomous fashion to constitutively reduce the in vitro and ex vivo angiogenic sprouting capacity of ECs. At a cellular level, we observed that silencing or inhibiting PKA in human ECs increased their invasive capacity, their generation of podosome rosettes and, consequently, their ability to degrade a collagen matrix. While inhibition of either Src-family kinases or of cdc42 reduced these events in control ECs, only cdc42 inhibition, or silencing, significantly impacted them in PKA(Cα)-silenced ECs. Consistent with these findings, cell-based measurements of cdc42 activity revealed that PKA activation inhibits EC cdc42 activity, at least in part, by promoting its interaction with the inhibitory regulator, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-α (RhoGDIα). © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Galectin-3 is a carbohydrate binding protein which has important roles in cancer and immunity. Potent galectin-3 inhibitors have been synthesized, for experimental purposes and potential clinical use. As galectin-3 is implicated in both intra- and extracellular activities, permeability of galectin-3 inhibitors is an important parameter determining biological effects. We compared the cellular uptake of galectin-3 inhibitors and their potency in the intracellular or extracellular space. The inhibitors differed in their polar surface area (PSA), but had similar affinities for galectin-3. Using a well-established permeability assay, we confirmed that the uptake was significantly higher for the inhibitor with the lowest PSA, as expected. To analyze intracellular activity of the inhibitors, we developed a novel assay based on galectin-3 accumulation around damaged intracellular vesicles. The results show striking differences between the inhibitors intracellular potency, correlating with their PSAs. To test extracellular activity of the inhibitors, we analyzed their potency to block binding of galectin-3 to cell surfaces. All inhibitors were equally able to block galectin-3 binding to cells and this was proportional to their affinity for galectin-3. These inhibitors may serve as useful tools in exploring biological roles of galectin-3 and may further our understanding of intracellular versus extracellular roles of galectin-3. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The proprotein convertase PACE4 has been validated as a potential target to develop new therapeutic interventions in prostate cancer (PCa). So far, the most effective compound blocking the activity of this enzyme has been designed based on the structure of a small peptide Ac-LLLLRVKR-NH 2 known as the Multi-Leu (ML) peptide. Optimization of this scaffold led to the synthesis of compound C23 (Ac-[DLeu]LLLRVK-amidinobenzylamide) with a potent in vivo inhibitory effect on the tumor growth. However, further developments of PACE4 inhibitors may require additional improvements to counter their rapid renal clearance and to increase their tumor targeting efficiency. Herein, we explored the transformation of the ML-peptide into an albumin-binding prodrug containing a tumor specific release mechanism based on the prostate-specific antigen. Our data confirms that intravenous treatment using the ML-peptide alone has little effect on tumor growth, whereas by using the ML-prodrug in LNCaP xenograft-bearing mice it was significantly reduced. Additionally, excellent in vivo stability and tumor-targeting efficiency was demonstrated using a radiolabelled version of this compound. Taken together, these results provide a solid foundation for further development of targeted PACE4 inhibition in PCa. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising method for detecting cancer margins during tumor resection. This study focused on differentiating tumorous from nontumorous tissues in human brain tissues using cross-polarization OCT (CP OCT). The study was performed on fresh ex vivo human brain tissues from 30 patients with high- and low-grade gliomas. Different tissue types that neurosurgeons should clearly distinguish during surgery, such as the cortex, white matter, necrosis and tumorous tissue, were separately analyzed. Based on volumetric CP OCT data, tumorous and normal brain tissue were differentiated using two optical coefficients — attenuation and forward cross-scattering. Compared with white matter, tumorous tissue without necrotic areas had significantly lower optical attenuation and forward cross-scattering values. The presence of particular morphological patterns, such as necrosis and injured myelinated fibers, can lead to dramatic changes in coefficient values and create some difficulties in differentiating between tissues. Color-coded CP OCT maps based on optical coefficients provided a visual assessment of the tissue. This study demonstrated the high translational potential of CP OCT in differentiating tumorous tissue from white matter. The clinical use of CP OCT during surgery in patients with gliomas could increase the extent of tumor resection and improve overall and progression-free survival. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "For a wide range of diseases, SNPs in the genome are the underlying mechanism of dysfunction. Therefore, targeted detection of these variations is of high importance for early diagnosis and (familial) screenings. While allele-specific PCR has been around for many years, its adoption for SNP genotyping or somatic mutation detection has been hampered by its low discriminating power and high costs. To tackle this, we developed a cost-effective qPCR based method, able to detect SNPs in a robust and specific manner. This study describes how to combine the basic principles of allele-specific PCR (the combination of a wild type and variant primer) with the straightforward readout of DNA-binding dye based qPCR technology. To enhance the robustness and discriminating power, an artificial mismatch in the allele-specific primer was introduced. The resulting method, called double-mismatch allele-specific qPCR (DMAS-qPCR), was successfully validated using 12 SNPs and 15 clinically relevant somatic mutations on 48 cancer cell lines. It is easy to use, does not require labeled probes and is characterized by high analytical sensitivity and specificity. DMAS-qPCR comes with a complimentary online assay design tool, available for the whole scientific community, enabling researchers to design custom assays and implement those as a diagnostic test. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding nucleotides playing a crucial role in posttranscriptional expression and regulation of target genes in nearly all kinds of cells. In this study, we demonstrate a reliable and efficient capture and purification of miRNAs and intracellular proteins using magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with antisense oligonucleotides. For this purpose, a tumor suppressor miRNA (miR-198), deregulated in several human cancer types, was chosen as the model oligonucleotide. Magnetite nanoparticles carrying the complementary sequence of miR-198 (miR-198 antisense) on their surface were delivered into cells and subsequently used for the extracellular transport of miRNA and proteins. The successful capture of miR-198 was demonstrated by isolating RNA from magnetic nanoparticles followed by real-time PCR quantification. Our experimental data showed that antisense-coated particles captured 5-fold higher amounts of miR-198 when compared to the control nanoparticles. Moreover, several proteins that could play a significant role in miR-198 biogenesis were found attached to miR-198 conjugated nanoparticles and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Our findings demonstrate that a purpose-driven vectorization of magnetic nanobeads with target-specific recognition ligands is highly efficient in selectively transporting miRNA and disease-relevant proteins out of cells and could become a reliable and useful tool for future diagnostic, therapeutic and analytical applications. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Phagocytosis is a process in which target cells or particles are engulfed and taken up by other cells, typically professional phagocytes; this process is crucial in many physiological processes and disease states. The detection of targets for phagocytosis is directed by a complex repertoire of cell surface receptors. Pattern recognition receptors directly detect targets for binding and uptake, while opsonic and complement receptors detect objects coated by soluble factors. However, the importance of single and combinatorial surface marker expression across different phenotypes of professional phagocytes is not known. Here we developed a novel mass cytometry-based phagocytosis assay that enables the simultaneous detection of phagocytic events in combination with up to 40 other protein markers. We applied this assay to distinct monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) populations and found that prototypic M2-like MDMs phagocytose more E. coli than M1-like MDMs. Surface markers such as CD14, CD206, and CD163 rendered macrophages phagocytosis competent, but only CD209 directly correlated with the amount of particle uptake. Similarly, M2-like MDMs also phagocytosed more cancer cells than M1-like MDMs but, unlike M1-like MDMs, were insensitive to anti-CD47 opsonization. Our approach facilitates the simultaneous study of single-cell phenotypes, phagocytic activity, signaling and transcriptional events in complex cell mixtures. © 2019, The Author(s).",
