    "Abstract": "Rhomboid-family intramembrane proteases regulate important biological processes and have been associated with malaria, cancer, and Parkinson's disease. However, due to the lack of potent, selective, and pharmacologically compliant inhibitors, the wide therapeutic potential of rhomboids is currently untapped. Here, we bridge this gap by discovering that peptidyl α-ketoamides substituted at the ketoamide nitrogen by hydrophobic groups are potent rhomboid inhibitors active in the nanomolar range, surpassing the currently used rhomboid inhibitors by up to three orders of magnitude. Such peptidyl ketoamides show selectivity for rhomboids, leaving most human serine hydrolases unaffected. Crystal structures show that these compounds bind the active site of rhomboid covalently and in a substrate-like manner, and kinetic analysis reveals their reversible, slow-binding, non-competitive mechanism. Since ketoamides are clinically used pharmacophores, our findings uncover a straightforward modular way for the design of specific inhibitors of rhomboid proteases, which can be widely applicable in cell biology and drug discovery. Ticha et al. discover rhomboid protease inhibitors that are unprecedentedly potent and selective. They are based on a pharmacologically compliant chemotype and can thus serve as hitherto unavailable specific tools for cell biology or can yield lead compounds targeting rhomboids in medically relevant contexts such as malaria or Parkinson's disease. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Membrane-bound enzyme complex of extrinsic tenase (VIIa/TF) is believed to be the primary activator of blood clotting in vivo. This complex (where factor VIIa (FVIIa) is a catalytically active part and tissue factor (TF) is its essential cofactor) activates its primary substrate factor X (FX) leading to factor Xa (FXa) (‘a’ stands for ‘activated’). Both FX and FXa are able to bind to phospholipid membrane and, therefore, are distributed between solution and membrane surface. As a result, two possible mechanisms of substrate delivery to the extrinsic tenase exist: via lateral diffusion on the membrane surface or directly from the solution. Determination of the predominant pathway of substrate delivery is an important key to understanding the precise reaction mechanism. Here we construct a mechanism-driven computational model of FX activation by extrinsic tenase on the surface of phospholipid vesicles of different size. We show that experimentally observed dependence of the tenase activity on the phospholipid concentration could be obtained only if the substrate (FX) is membrane-bound. For correct experimental data description it is also necessary to take into account the dependence of FX/FXa membrane binding parameters (equilibrium dissociation constant and the number of phospholipid molecules per bound FX/FXa) on the membrane curvature. The model predicts that small vesicles promote activation of FX by the extrinsic tenase significantly better than large vesicles (with the same overall phospholipid, factors VIIa, X and TF concentrations in the solution). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Cancer cells frequently exhibit chromosomal abnormalities. Specific cytogenetic aberrations often are predictors of outcome, especially in hematologic neoplasms, such as monosomy 7 in myeloid malignancies. The functional consequences of aneuploidy at the cellular level are difficult to assess because of a lack of convenient markers to distinguish abnormal from diploid cells. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow of 4 healthy donors and5 patients withbonemarrowfailureandchromosomegainor loss. In total, transcriptome sequences were obtained from 391 control cells and 588 cells from patients. We characterized normal hematopoiesis as binary differentiation from stem cells to erythroid and myeloid-lymphoidpathways.Aneuploid cellsweredistinguished fromdiploid cells in patient samples by computational analyses of read fractions and gene expression of individual chromosomes.Weconfirmedassignment of aneuploidy to individual cells quantitatively, by copy-number variation, and qualitatively, by loss of heterozygosity. When we projected patients'singlecellsonto themapofnormalhematopoiesis, diversepatternswere observed, broadly reflecting clinical phenotypes. Patients' monosomy 7 cells showed downregulation of genes involved in immune response and DNA damage checkpoint and apoptosis pathways, whichmay contribute to the clonal expansion of monosomy 7 cells with accumulated gene mutations. scRNA-seq is a powerful technique through which to infer the functional consequences of chromosome gain and loss and explore gene targets for directed therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a complex syndrome with sepsis occurring in critical patients, who usually lack effective therapy. Nuciferine is a primary bioactive component extracted from the lotus leaf, and it displays extensive pharmacological functions, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Nevertheless, the effects of nuciferine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated ALI in mice has not been investigated. ALI of mice stimulated by LPS was used to determine the anti-inflammatory function of nuciferine. The molecular mechanism of nuciferine was performed on RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The results of pathological section, myeloperoxidase activity and lung wet/dry ratio showed that nuciferine alleviated LPS-induced lung injury (p < 0.05). qRT-PCR and ELISA experiments suggested that nuciferine inhibited TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β secretion in tissues and RAW264.7 cells but increased IL-10 secretion (p < 0.05). Molecular studies showed that TLR4 expression and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation were both inhibited by nuciferine treatment (p < 0.05). To further investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of nuciferine, TLR4 was knocked down. When TLR4 was silenced, LPS induced the production of IL-1β, and TNF-α was markedly decreased by TLR4-siRNA and nuciferine treatment in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells (p < 0.05). These results suggested that nuciferine had the ability to protect against LPS-stimulated ALI. Thus, nuciferine may be a potential drug for treating LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. © 2017 Wu, Yang, Guo, Yang, Jiang, Zhao, Qiu and Deng.",

    "Abstract": "Background: It is well known that patient characteristics and survival outcomes in randomized trials may not necessarily be similar to those in real-life clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to analyse second line treatment strategies in the real-world practice and to estimate the outcomes of patients treated with second-line targeted therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Methods: This is a retrospective, registry-based study using data from the national registry of targeted therapies for mRCC. The RENIS registry contains data on 3049 patients who started the therapy with at least one targeted agent before 31 December, 2014. Of these patients, 1029 had a record of at least two different targeted therapies and sufficient data for analysis. Survival analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance of differences in survival between subgroups was assessed using the log-rank test. Results: The median overall survival from the start of second-line treatment was 17.0months (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.5-19.5months), 17.1months (95% CI 14.5-19.8), and 15.4months (95% CI 11.0-19.7) for second-line everolimus, sorafenib, and sunitinib, respectively. Patients receiving second-line everolimus were older at the start of second-line treatment, more likely to have metachronous disease, and less likely to be previously treated with cytokines or to continue to third-line treatment than patients treated with second-line sunitinib or sorafenib. Progression-free survival (PFS) correlated with PFS on first-line treatment only for everolimus. Conclusions: In this retrospective study, no significant differences in survival were observed between the cohorts treated with different second-line agents including everolimus, sorafenib, and sunitinib. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objective Recurrent esophageal strictures (ESs) following esophageal atresia repair or caustic ingestion represent a common clinical problem. Recently, Mitomycin C was reported to improve the outcome of patients by reducing the number of endoscopic dilatations. However, other groups failed to exhibit a beneficial effect. We report on our experience with topic Mitomycin C application following endoscopic dilatation for recurrent ES. Methods Retrospective chart review of patients with ES treated at the Hannover Medical School (Location A) and the University of Leipzig (Location B) between 2009 and 2015. A Mitomycin C-soaked cotton swab was endoscopically placed at the area of stricture in all subjects. Successful treatment was defined as resolution of stricture after Mitomycin C therapy with not more than three dilatations thereafter. Our results were compared with published outcomes of alternative studies that involved 10 or more patients. Results A total of 11 children received Mitomycin C concurrently with endoscopic dilatations. Seven children (64%) had gross type C esophageal atresia, two patients (18%) gross type A esophageal atresia, and two children (18%) caustic injury. After a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 14-75 months) and a median number of 3 ± 2.5 dilatations with Mitomycin C application per patient (range, 1-9), 6 of 11 patients (55%) achieved a resolution of their strictures. Five patients (45%) did not respond to Mitomycin C therapy, of which two needed esophageal redo-surgery. Conclusion We failed to confirm the high success rates of Mitomycin C treatment for recurrent ESs. Given the fact that there is limited data to prove the beneficial effect of Mitomycin C treatment, pediatric surgeons should carefully consider whether the advantages of this therapy outweigh the necessity of life-long endoscopic follow-ups. Further randomized controlled studies are recommended. © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The nuclear epigenetic integrator UHRF1 is known to play a key role with DNMT1 in maintaining the DNA methylation patterns during cell division. Among UHRF1 partners, TIP60 takes part in epigenetic regulations through its acetyltransferase activity. Both proteins are involved in multiple cellular functions such as chromatin remodeling, DNA damage repair and regulation of stability and activity of other proteins. The aim of this work was to investigate the interaction between UHRF1 and TIP60 in order to elucidate the dialogue between these two proteins. Methods: Biochemical (immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays) and microscopic (confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy; FLIM) techniques were used to analyze the interaction between TIP60 and UHRF1 in vitro and in vivo. Global methylation levels were assessed by using a specific kit. The results were statistically analyzed using Graphpad prism and Origin. Results: Our study shows that UHRF1, TIP60 and DNMT1 were found in the same epigenetic macro-molecular complex. In vitro pull-down assay showed that deletion of either the zinc finger in MYST domain or deletion of whole MYST domain from TIP60 significantly reduced its interaction with UHRF1. Confocal and FLIM microscopy showed that UHRF1 co-localized with TIP60 in the nucleus and confirmed that both proteins interacted together through the MYST domain of TIP60. Moreover, overexpression of TIP60 reduced the DNA methylation levels in HeLa cells along with downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate for the first time that TIP60 through its MYST domain directly interacts with UHRF1 which might be of high interest for the development of novel oncogenic inhibitors targeting this interaction. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The left-right determination factor (LEFTY) is a novel member of the TGF-β/Smad2 pathway and belongs to the premenstrual/menstrual repertoire in human endometrium, but little is known about its functional role in endometrial carcinomas (Em Cas). Herein, we focused on LEFTY expression and its association with progesterone therapy in Em Cas. Methods: Regulation and function of LEFTY, as well as its associated molecules including Smad2, ovarian hormone receptors, GSK-3β, and cell cycle-related factors, were assessed using clinical samples and cell lines of Em Cas. Results: In clinical samples, LEFTY expression was positively correlated with estrogen receptor-α, but not progesterone receptor (PR), status, and was inversely related to phosphorylated (p) Smad2, cyclin A2, and Ki-67 levels. During progesterone therapy, expression of LEFTY, pSmad2, and pGSK-3β showed stepwise increases, with significant correlations to morphological changes toward secretory features and decreased Ki-67 values. In Ishikawa cells, an Em Ca cell line that expresses PR, progesterone treatment reduced proliferation and induced increased expression of LEFTY and pGSK-3β, although LEFTY promoter regions were inhibited by transfection of PR. Moreover, inhibition of GSK-3β resulted in increased LEFTY expression through a decrease in its ubiquitinated form, suggesting posttranslational regulation of LEFTY protein via GSK-3β suppression in response to progesterone. In addition, overexpression or knockdown of LEFTY led to suppression or enhancement of Smad2-dependent cyclin A2 expression, respectively. Conclusion: Upregulation of LEFTY may serve as a useful clinical marker for the therapeutic effects of progesterone for Em Cas, leading to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation through alteration in Smad2-dependent transcription of cyclin A2. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Toombak is a form of smokeless tobacco (SLT) that is locally made and consumed in Sudan and contains several carcinogenic elements. Use of Toombak has been etiologically linked to various oral diseases including oral cancer. This study aimed to obtain baseline information about the Toombak use among Sudanese school workers, as well as their knowledge about Toombak related health hazards and attitude towards their role in Toombak control. In addition, this study assessed the availability and effectiveness of control policies and preventive practices in the schools. Methods: A cross-sectional school-based study using one-stage stratified random sampling procedure; four schools were selected randomly from each of seven localities. A total of 239 school workers' were recruited (census) from the selected schools in Khartoum State, Sudan. Results: Of the school workers, 63% (147) were ≤40 years, half were females and 79.2% (187) were teachers. A total of 9.6% (22) school workers confirmed ever use of Toombak and the percentage of daily users amounted to 64.7% (11). Moreover, 76.2% (16) of ever Toombak users were ≥40 years and all of them were males (p < 0.001). Most of the school workers reported good knowledge, positive attitude towards their role in Toombak control and good preventive practice. Female school workers were more likely to report positive attitude towards their role in Toombak control (p < 05), and to report good knowledge. Those reporting good preventive practice in schools reported good knowledge more than two times than their counterpart (p < 0.001). Age was the strongest predictor of ever Toombak use among school workers (p < .001). Conclusions: The use of Toombak among school workers was associated with poor knowledge, negative attitude towards their role in Toombak control and poor preventive practice, Therefore, school workers use of Toombak may reduce their motivation and use of their potential in the prevention of a major health problem caused by Toombak use and affects their role model behaviour. On the other hand, school workers engagement with preventive practices in schools' was associated with good knowledge which in turn empowers their positive attitude towards their role in Toombak control. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Covalent inhibitors of K-Ras(G12C) have been reported that exclusively recognize the GDP state. Here, we utilize disulfide tethering of a non-natural cysteine (K-Ras(M72C)) to identify a new switch-II pocket (S-IIP) binding ligand (2C07) that engages the active GTP state. Co-crystal structures of 2C07 bound to H-Ras(M72C) reveal binding in a cryptic groove we term S-IIG. In the GppNHp state, 2C07 binding to a modified S-IIP pushes switch I away from the nucleotide, breaking the network of polar contacts essential for adopting the canonical GTP state. Biochemical studies show that 2C07 alters nucleotide preference and inhibits SOS binding and catalyzed nucleotide exchange. 2C07 was converted to irreversible covalent analogs, which target both nucleotide states, inhibit PI3K activation in vitro, and function as occupancy probes to detect reversible engagement in competition assays. Targeting both nucleotide states opens the possibility of inhibiting oncogenic mutants of Ras, which exist predominantly in the GTP state in cells. Small-molecule Ras inhibitors offer a promising avenue to address the 20% of cancers driven by this oncogene. Gentile et al. structurally and biochemically characterize a new switch-II binder, 2C07, which expands switch-II pocket inhibition to both nucleotide states by stabilizing Ras GDP and preventing PI3K activation by Ras GTP. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Pediatric T-Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients often display resistance to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. These patients, classified as prednisone poor responders (PPR), have poorer outcome than do the other pediatric T-ALL patients receiving a highrisk adapted therapy. Because glucocorticoids are administered to ALL patients during all the different phases of therapy, GC resistance represents an important challenge to improving the outcome for these patients. Mechanisms underlying resistance are not yet fully unraveled; thus our research focused on the identification of deregulated signaling pathways to point out new targeted approaches. We first identified, by reverse-phase protein arrays, the lymphocyte cell-specific protein-Tyrosine kinase (LCK) as aberrantly activated in PPR patients. We showed that LCK inhibitors, such as dasatinib, bosutinib, nintedanib, and WH-4-023, are able to induce cell death in GC-resistant T-ALL cells, and remarkably, cotreatment with dexamethasone is able to reverse GC resistance, even at therapeutic drug concentrations. This was confirmed by specificLCKgene silencing and ex vivo combined treatment of cells fromPPRpatient-derived xenografts. Moreover, we observed that LCK hyperactivation in PPR patients upregulates the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling triggering to interleukin-4 (IL-4) overexpression. GC-sensitive cells cultured with IL-4 display an increased resistance to dexamethasone, whereas the inhibition of IL-4 signaling could increase GC-induced apoptosis in resistant cells. Treatment with dexamethasone and dasatinib also impaired engraftment of leukemia cells in vivo. Our results suggest a quickly actionable approach to supporting conventional therapies and overcoming GC resistance in pediatric T-ALL patients. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lead is well known environmental pollutant, which can cause toxic effects in multiple organ systems. However, the influence of lead oxide nanoparticles, frequently emitted to the environment by high temperature technological processes, is still concealed. Therefore, we investigate lead oxide nanoparticle distribution through the body upon their entry into lungs and determine the microscopic and ultramicroscopic changes caused by the nanoparticles in primary and secondary target organs. Methods: Adult female mice (ICR strain) were continuously exposed to lead oxide nanoparticles (PbO-NPs) with an average concentration approximately 106 particles/cm3 for 6 weeks (24 h/day, 7 days/week). At the end of the exposure period, lung, brain, liver, kidney, spleen, and blood were collected for chemical, histological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses. Results: Lead content was found to be the highest in the kidney and lungs, followed by the liver and spleen; the smallest content of lead was found in brain. Nanoparticles were located in all analysed tissues and their highest number was found in the lung and liver. Kidney, spleen and brain contained lower number of nanoparticles, being about the same in all three organs. Lungs of animals exposed to lead oxide nanoparticles exhibited hyperaemia, small areas of atelectasis, alveolar emphysema, focal acute catarrhal bronchiolitis and also haemostasis with presence of siderophages in some animals. Nanoparticles were located in phagosomes or formed clusters within cytoplasmic vesicles. In the liver, lead oxide nanoparticle exposure caused hepatic remodeling with enlargement and hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes, centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes with karyomegaly, areas of hepatic necrosis, occasional periportal inflammation, and extensive accumulation of lipid droplets. Nanoparticles were accumulated within mitochondria and peroxisomes forming aggregates enveloped by an electron-dense mitochondrial matrix. Only in some kidney samples, we observed areas of inflammatory infiltrates around renal corpuscles, tubules or vessels in the cortex. Lead oxide nanoparticles were dispersed in the cytoplasm, but not within cell organelles. There were no significant morphological changes in the spleen as a secondary target organ. Thus, pathological changes correlated with the amount of nanoparticles found in cells rather than with the concentration of lead in a given organ. Conclusions: Sub-chronic exposure to lead oxide nanoparticles has profound negative effects at both cellular and tissue levels. Notably, the fate and arrangement of lead oxide nanoparticles were dependent on the type of organs. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Limited data are available on the survival of patients with breast cancer with preexisting mental illness, and elderly women are of special interest because they experience the highest incidence of breast cancer. Therefore, we compared all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality for elderly patients with breast cancer with and without mental illness. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by using SEER-Medicare data, including 19,028 women ≥ 68 years of age who were diagnosed with stage I to IIIa breast cancer in the United States from 2005 to 2007. Patients were classified as having severe mental illness if an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification code for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorder was recorded on at least one inpatient or two outpatient claims during the 3 years before breast cancer diagnosis. Patients were followed for up to 5 years after breast cancer diagnosis to assess survival outcomes, which were then compared with those of patients without mental illness. Results: Nearly 3% of patients had preexisting severe mental illness. We observed a two-fold increase in the all-cause mortality hazard between patients with severe mental illness compared with those without mental illness after adjusting for age, income, race, ethnicity, geographic location, and marital status (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.84 to 2.60). A 20% increase in breast cancer-specific mortality hazard was observed, but the association was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.74). Patients with severe mental illness were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and aggressive tumor characteristics. They also had increased tobacco use and more comorbidities. Conclusion: Patients with severe mental illness may need assistance with coordinating medical services. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) have a biologically stable in tumor architecture, drug responsiveness, mutational status and global gene-expression patterns. Numerous PDX models have been established to date, however their thorough characterization regarding the tumor formation and rates of tumor growth in the established models remains a challenging task. Our study aimed to provide more detailed information for establishing the PDX models successfully and effectively. Methods: We transplanted four different types of solid tumors from 108 Chinese patients, including 21 glioblastoma (GBM), 11 lung cancers (LC), 54 gastric cancers (GC) and 21 colorectal cancers (CRC), and took tumor tissues passaged for three successive generations. Here we report the rate of tumor formation, tumor-forming times, tumor growth curves and mortality of mice in PDX model. We also report H&E staining and immunohistochemistry for HLA-A, CD45, Ki67, GFAP, and CEA protein expression between patient cancer tissues and PDX models. Results: Tumor formation rate increasedsignificantly in subsequent tumor generations. Also, the survival rates of GC and CRC were remarkably higher than GBM and LC. As for the time required for the formation of tumors, which reflects the tumor growth rate, indicated that tumor growth rate always increased as the generation number increased. The tumor growth curves also illustrate this law. Similarly, the survival rate of PDX mice gradually improved with the increased generation number in GC and CRC. And generally, there was more proliferation (Ki67+) in the PDX models than in the patient tumors, which was in accordance with the results of tumor growth rate. The histological findings confirm similar histological architecture and degrees of differentiation between patient cancer tissues and PDX models with statistical analysis by GraphPad Prism 5.0. Conclusion: We established four different types of PDX models successfully, and our results add to the current understanding of the establishment of PDX models and may contribute to the extension of application of different types of PDX models. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Sister Study was designed to address gaps in the study of environment and breast cancer by taking advantage of more frequent breast cancer diagnoses among women with a sister history of breast cancer and the presumed enrichment of shared environmental and genetic exposures.OBJECTIVE: The Sister Study sought a large cohort of women never diagnosed with breast cancer but who had a sister (full or half) diagnosed with breast cancer.METHODS: A multifaceted national effort employed novel strategies to recruit a diverse cohort, and collected biological and environmental samples and extensive data on potential breast cancer risk factors.RESULTS: The Sister Study enrolled 50,884 U.S. and Puerto Rican women 35-74y of age (median 56 y). Although the majority were non-Hispanic white, well educated, and economically well off, substantial numbers of harder-to-recruit women also enrolled (race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white: 16%; no college degree: 35%; household income <$50,000: 26%). Although all had a biologic sister with breast cancer, 16.5% had average or lower risk of breast cancer according to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (Gail score). Most were postmenopausal (66%), parous with a first full-term pregnancy <30y of age (79%), never-smokers (56%) with body mass indexes (BMIs) of <29.9 kg/m2 (70%). Few (5%) reported any cancer prior to enrollment.CONCLUSIONS: The Sister Study is a unique cohort designed to efficiently study environmental and genetic risk factors for breast cancer. Extensive exposure data over the life-course and baseline specimens provide important opportunities for studying breast cancer and other health outcomes in women. Collaborations are welcome. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1923.",

    "Abstract": "Taurine upregulated 1 gene (TUG1) is a long non-coding RNA associated with several types of cancer. Recently, differential expression of TUG1 was found in cancerous breast tissues and associated with breast cancer malignancy features. Although this is evidence of a potential role in breast cancer, TUG1 expression could not be associated with different subtypes, possibly due to the small number of samples analyzed. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and, based on molecular signatures, may be classified into different subtypes with prognostic implications. In the present study, we include analysis of TUG1 expression in 796 invasive breast carcinoma and 105 normal samples of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and describe that TUG1 expression is increased in HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes compared to luminal A. Additionally, TUG1 expression is associated with survival in HER2-enriched patients. These results reinforce the importance of TUG1 in breast cancer and outline its potential impact on specific subtypes. © 2016 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "This study was intended to analyze effects of lncRNA CRNDE on cervical cancer cell growth and metastasis. Fifty pairs of cervical cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues were collected. Expressions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tissue samples were detected by microarray analysis. Expression levels of CRNDE in cervical cancer cells and normal cells were detected by qRT-PCR. Cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and clone formation assay were utilized to evaluate cell growth. Wound healing assay and Transwell assay were conducted to detect the migratory and invasive capability of cervical cancer cells. The expressions of CRNDE in cervical cancer tissues and cells were higher than those in normal tissues and cells. CCK-8 assay and clone formation assay showed that the knockdown of CRNDE could inhibit the cell proliferation of HeLa and C-33A cells. Wound healing assay indicated that the downregulation of CRNDE expression could suppress the cell migration. The result of a Transwell assay demonstrated that the number of invasion cells reduced in the CRNDE-si group in comparison with the Mock group. LncRNA CRNDE could promote the cell growth and stimulate the metastasis of cervical cancer cells. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.",

    "Abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the expression of amine oxidase proteins in breast cancer and their clinical implications. We performed immunohistochemical staining of amine oxidase proteins (LOX, lysyl oxidase, AOC3, amine oxidase, MAOA, monoamine oxidase A, MAOB, monoamine oxidase B). Based on their hormone receptors, such as estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining, breast cancer was divided into four molecular subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER-2 type, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Luminal A was observed in 380 cases (49.4%), luminal B in 224 (29.1%), HER-2 type in 68 (8.8%), and TNBC in 98 (12.7%). Stromal AOC3, MAO-A, and MAO-B expression varied according to molecular subtypes. Stromal AOC3 expression was high in luminal B and HER-2 type and MAO-A expression was high in luminal A and luminal B (p < 0.001). MAO-B expression was higher in TNBC than in other subtypes (p = 0.020). LOX positivity was associated with high histological grade (p < 0.001) and high Ki-67 labeling index (LI) (p = 0.009), and stromal AOC3 positivity was associated with high histological grade (p = 0.001), high Ki-67 LI (p < 0.001), and HER-2 positivity (p = 0.002). MAO-A positivity was related to low histological grade (p < 0.001), ER positivity, PR positivity (p < 0.001), and low Ki-67 LI (p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, MAO-A positivity was related to short disease-free survival in HER-2 type (p = 0.013), AOC3 negativity was related to short disease-free survival and overall survival in ER-positive breast cancer, PR-positive breast cancer, HER-2-negative breast cancer, and lymph node metastasis. In conclusion, the expression of amine oxidase proteins varies depending on the molecular subtype of breast cancer. Stromal AOC3 expression was high in luminal B and HER-2 type, and MAO-A expression was high in luminal A and luminal B. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland",

    "Abstract": "Background: Histones undergo extensive post-translational modifications and this epigenetic regulation plays an important role in modulating transcriptional programs capable of driving cancer progression. Acetylation of histone H3K18, associated with gene activation, is enhanced by P300 and opposed by the deacetylase Sirtuin2 (SIRT2). As these enzymes represent an important target for cancer therapy, we sought to determine whether the underlying genes are altered during prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Methods: Tissue microarrays generated from 71 radical prostatectomy patients were initially immunostained for H3K18Ac, P300 and SIRT2. Protein levels were quantified using VECTRA automation and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA, n = 499) and Gene Expression Omnibus (n = 504) databases were queried for expression, genomic and clinical data. Statistics were performed using SPSSv23. Results: Nuclear histone H3K18Ac staining increases in primary cancer (p = 0.05) and further in metastases (p < 0.01) compared to benign on tissue arrays. P300 protein expression increases in cancer (p = 0.04) and metastases (p < 0.001). A progressive decrease in nuclear SIRT2 staining occurs comparing benign to cancer or metastases (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03 respectively). Decreased SIRT2 correlates with higher grade cancer (p = 0.02). Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence is shorter in patients exhibiting high compared to low H3K18Ac expression (350 vs. 1542 days respectively, P = 0.03). In GEO, SIRT2 mRNA levels are lower in primary and metastatic tumors (p = 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). TGCA analysis demonstrates SIRT2 deletion in 6% and increasing clinical stage, positive margins and lower PSA recurrence-free survival in patients with SIRT2 loss/deletion (p = 0.01, 0.04 and 0.04 respectively). In this dataset, a correlation between decreasing SIRT2 and increasing P300 mRNA expression occurs in tumor samples (R = -0.46). Conclusions: In multiple datasets, decreases in SIRT2 expression portend worse clinicopathologic outcomes. Alterations in SIRT2-H3K18Ac suggest altered P300 activity and identify a subset of tumors that could benefit from histone deacetylation inhibition. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Parents with cancer have high rates of psychological morbidity, and their children are at risk of poor psychosocial outcomes, particularly in the context of parental distress and poor family communication. Parents express concerns about the impact of cancer on their children and report a lack of professional guidance in meeting their children's needs. Few parenting interventions exist and current interventions have extensive infrastructure demands making them unsuitable for routine use in most health settings. The aims of this study are to develop and establish the feasibility and acceptability of a novel and accessible psycho-educational intervention to improve parenting efficacy and decrease parental stress among adults with cancer who have children aged 3-12 years. The intervention will be suitable for parents with cancer who are receiving treatment with a view to longer term survival, irrespective of cancer diagnosis, and their respective co-parents. Methods/design: This study comprises two phases using the UK Medical Research Council framework for developing complex interventions. In the development phase, intervention content will be iteratively developed and evaluated in consultation with consumers, and in the piloting phase, feasibility will be tested in a clinical sample of 20 parents with cancer and their co-parents using a single arm, pre-test post-test design. The intervention will comprise an audiovisual resource (DVD), a question prompt list, and a telephone call with a clinical psychologist. Questionnaires administered pre- and 1 month post-intervention will assess parental stress, psychological morbidity, quality of life, self-efficacy and perceptions of child adjustment, and family functioning. Intervention feasibility will be determined by mixed-method participant evaluation of perceived usefulness, benefits, and acceptability. Discussion: This new initiative will translate existing descriptive evidence into an accessible intervention that supports parenting during cancer treatment and meets the information needs of parents with cancer and their families. This is an important advance: despite increasing recognition of the impact of parental cancer on the family, intervention research lags behind the descriptive literature. This low-intensity, accessible, and targeted intervention places minimal burden on infrastructure and promotes patient autonomy and self-management. If feasible, this style of intervention may be a template for future interventions with similar populations. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Diverse molecular alterations associated with smoking in normal and precursor lung cancer cells have been reported, yet their role in lung cancer etiology remains unclear. A prominent example is hypomethylation of the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor repressor (AHRR) locus, which is observed in blood and squamous epithelial cells of smokers, but not in lung cancer. Results: Using a novel systems-epigenomics algorithm, called SEPIRA, which leverages the power of a large RNA-sequencing expression compendium to infer regulatory activity from messenger RNA expression or DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, we infer the landscape of binding activity of lung-specific transcription factors (TFs) in lung carcinogenesis. We show that lung-specific TFs become preferentially inactivated in lung cancer and precursor lung cancer lesions and further demonstrate that these results can be derived using only DNAm data. We identify subsets of TFs which become inactivated in precursor cells. Among these regulatory factors, we identify AHR, the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor which controls a healthy immune response in the lung epithelium and whose repressor, AHRR, has recently been implicated in smoking-mediated lung cancer. In addition, we identify FOXJ1, a TF which promotes growth of airway cilia and effective clearance of the lung airway epithelium from carcinogens. Conclusions: We identify TFs, such as AHR, which become inactivated in the earliest stages of lung cancer and which, unlike AHRR hypomethylation, are also inactivated in lung cancer itself. The novel systems-epigenomics algorithm SEPIRA will be useful to the wider epigenome-wide association study community as a means of inferring regulatory activity. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Right-sided colon cancer (RCC) and left-sided colon cancer (LCC) differ with respect to their biology and genomic patterns, but inflammatory index variation did not fully investigate. This study aimed to examine the difference of inflammatory indexes and its value between RCC and LCC. Methods: The differences of common clinicopathologic factors, inflammatory indexes including PLR (Platelet lymphocyte ratio) between LCC and RCC were analyzed in the training cohort with logistic regression model, subsequently, confirmed in validation cohort. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied for the analysis of the survival difference distinguished by the PLR and the Nonparametric Test was adopted to demonstrate the difference of PLR variation with the standard TNM classification between RCC and LCC. Results: A total of 1846 CRC patients entered the study, 744 (40.3%) patients were RCC, 1102 (59.7%) were LCC. The patients' number in both cohorts was 923. It was found that LCC patients in the training cohort significantly to be with higher CEA, adenocarcinoma, early UICC/AJCC stage, p-MMR (mismatch-repair proficient), and lower PLR, and the later four features were confirm in validation cohort. Higher PLR, the unique inflammatory index, was significantly associated with poorer OS in LCC cohort (P = 0.002) and was elevated with the TNM stage in the LCC patients (P < 0.001), however, the two relationships did not sustain in RCC patients. Conclusion: Expect the classical characteristics, PLR, an inexpensive and easily assessable inflammatory index was found first time to be significant differ between LCC and RCC. Further, elevated PLR associated with poor OS (overall survival) in the LCC and more common in advanced TNM stage. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in patients on cancer chemotherapy, with the identification of risk factors for these DDIs. This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study carried out at the Department of Onco-Radiation at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot, Punjab. The DDIs were recorded with the help of a drug interaction/interplay information software. In total, 354 interactions were identified from 283 patient records. The mean age of the patients in the study was 49.05±14.35 years. According to the mechanism of interaction, 306 (86.44%) drug interactions were classified as pharmacokinetic and 48 (13.56%) as pharmacodynamic in nature. Sensitization of the treating oncologist and the establishment of alerts, such as electronic alerts or a novel fully digital computerized technology that gives a warning when a health expert enters a patient's prescription orders into the electronic medical documentation, can be helpful in controlling DDIs. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "We report a patient who presented with synchronous second primary human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2-positive breast cancer and rectal cancer that both required simultaneous neoadjuvant therapy. A modified regimen combining anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab with chemotherapy and external beam radiation was selected. An organ-preserving surgical procedure was possible both in the breast and the rectum. Citrulline decreased rapidly after the start of the treatment, then gradually returned to pre-treatment levels after the completion of chemoradiation. Urinary neopterin concentrations exhibited a fluctuating course. Both serum neopterin and C-reactive protein concentrations were more or less stable during the initial administration of trastuzumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin and then increased steeply during chemoradiation and subsequently declined to pre-treatment levels during the weekly trastuzumab administration. Changes were observed in the serum retinol concentrations. A decline in lymphocyte counts was accompanied by marked changes in peripheral blood cell count-derived ratios. The present case report demonstrates a successful combination of two neoadjuvant regimens in a patient with two synchronous different second primary tumors. Data from this case also illustrate the use of biomarkers for monitoring of intensive therapeutic regimens in medical and radiation oncology. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is prevalent, distressing, and long lasting. This study evaluated the impact of a theoretically/empirically based intervention (ConquerFear) on FCR. Methods: Eligible survivors had curable breast or colorectal cancer or melanoma, had completed treatment (not including endocrine therapy) 2 months to 5 years previously, were age > 18 years, and had scores above the clinical cutoff on the FCR Inventory (FCRI) severity subscale at screening. Participants were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to either five face-to-face sessions of ConquerFear (attention training, metacognitions, acceptance/mindfulness, screening behavior, and values-based goal setting) or an attention control (Taking-it-Easy relaxation therapy). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), immediately post-therapy (T1), and 3 (T2) and 6 months (T3) later. The primary outcome was FCRI total score. Results: Of 704 potentially eligible survivors from 17 sites and two online databases, 533 were contactable, of whom 222 (42%) consented; 121 were randomly assigned to intervention and 101 to control. Study arms were equivalent at baseline on all measured characteristics. ConquerFear participants had clinically and statistically greater improvements than control participants from T0 to T1 on FCRI total (P <.001) and severity subscale scores (P =.001), which were maintained at T2 (P =.017 and P =.023, respectively) and, for FCRI total only, at T3 (P =.018), and from T0 to T1 on three FCRI subscales (coping, psychological distress, and triggers) as well as in general anxiety, cancer-specific distress (total), and mental quality of life and metacognitions (total). Differences in FCRI psychological distress and cancer-specific distress (total) remained significantly different at T3. Conclusion: This randomized trial demonstrated efficacy of ConquerFear compared with attention control (Taking-it-Easy) in reduction of FCRI total scores immediately post-therapy and 3 and 6 months later and in many secondary outcomes immediately post-therapy. Cancer-specific distress (total) remained more improved at 3- and 6-month follow-up. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the concentrations of neopterin, kynurenine and tryptophan in wound secretion in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer or malignant melanoma. Twenty-two patients, 16 females and 6 males, undergoing surgery for breast cancer (n=15) or malignant melanoma (n=7) were evaluated. Neopterin, kynurenine and tryptophan were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. When the concentrations in wound secretions from the primary breast tumor and the axilla were compared, the neopterin/tryptophan ratio was significantly higher in the tumor wound secretions (0.92±0.41 vs. 0.61±0.14 mmol/mol; p=0.049), but no significant differences were observed in neopterin (49.2±28.6 vs. 31.5±11.1 nmol/L), tryptophan (52.9±13.0 vs. 51.2±13.3 μmol/L) and kynurenine concentrations (5.97±7.49 vs. 5.34±6.25 μmol/L) and kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (108.1±107.7 vs. 103.5±106.7 mmol/mol). No marked differences were noted in neopterin, tryptophan and kynurenine concentrations and kynurenine/tryptophan and neopterin/tryptophan ratios in sequential samples from the axilla of breast cancer patients obtained on days 1 and 2. In conclusion, present data demonstrate that the measurement of neopterin, kynurenine and tryptophan can be used to monitor local immune response after cancer surgery. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

The purpose of the present study was to detect whether the preoperative the red distribution width (RDW) and the platelet distribution width (PDW) can be used to distinguish patients with gastric cancer (GC) or early stage GC from the healthy controls and predict the progression and prognosis of the GC. Methods: The RDW and PDW values of 227 patients with GC and 164 patients with early GC were retrospectively analyzed comparing with 101 healthy controls. In addition, the clinicopathological features, survival curves and prognosis of the patients with GC were compared between the high and low groups according to the RDW and PDW values. Results: Significant higher RDW and lower PDW were detected in patients with GC and early GC compared to the healthy controls. A higher RDW was significantly associated with older age, a larger tumor diameter, deeper tumor infiltration, and lymph node metastasis while a lower PDW was significantly associated with male, older age, a larger tumor diameter, deeper tumor infiltration, elevated CEA and CA125. Increased RDW was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for GC (P = 0.042 and P = 0.033, respectively) and early GC (P = 0.037 and P = 0.009, respectively) while decreased PDW indicated a significantly association with poor DFS for early GC (P = 0.006). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis showed that RDW and PDW can act as independent prognostic factors for DFS (P = 0.028 and P = 0.020) in patients with early GC. Conclusion: The preoperative RDW and PDW were simple and convenient predictive factors for the progression and prognosis of patients with GC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Acute liver failure (ALF) induced by diffuse metastatic disease has rarely been reported. Case presentation: We present a 51-years-old woman with relevant clinical history for breast cancer. The patient was admitted in the emergency department with jaundice, dark urine and pale stools. She was on the 10th day of hormonotherapy for recurrence of breast cancer, diagnosed 7 years previously. Usual causes of acute liver failure were excluded, all drugs were stopped and the imaging studies performed were positive only for steatosis. Nonetheless, ALF progressed and the patient died 4 days later. Autopsy demonstrated a massive intrasinusoidal infiltration of the liver by breast cancer cells. Conclusion: We highlight a rare cause of ALF. Although uncommon, physicians should be alert for this situation as the diagnosis can be challenging and the imaging studies can remain normal. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A structure-based design of a new generation of tumor-associated glycopeptides with improved affinity against two anti-MUC1 antibodies is described. These unique antigens feature a fluorinated proline residue, such as a (4S)-4-fluoro-l-proline or 4,4-difluoro-l-proline, at the most immunogenic domain. Binding assays using biolayer interferometry reveal 3-fold to 10-fold affinity improvement with respect to the natural (glyco)peptides. According to X-ray crystallography and MD simulations, the fluorinated residues stabilize the antigen-antibody complex by enhancing key CH/π interactions. Interestingly, a notable improvement in detection of cancer-associated anti-MUC1 antibodies from serum of patients with prostate cancer is achieved with the non-natural antigens, which proves that these derivatives can be considered better diagnostic tools than the natural antigen for prostate cancer. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The role of stress signals in regulating gastric cancer initiation and progression is not quite clear. It is known that stress signals modulate multiple processes such as immune function, cell migration and angiogenesis. However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms of how stress signals contribute to gastric cancer angiogenesis. Methods: Here, we used β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) agonist isoprenaline to imitate a stress signal and demonstrated the molecular mechanism underlying stress's influence on tumor angiogenesis. Results: We found that isoprenaline stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in gastric cancer cells and plexin-A1 expression was induced by human recombinant VEGF165 in both gastric cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, interfere with plexin-A1 expression in gastric cancer cells influence HUVEC tube formation, migration and tumor growth in vivo. Conclusions: These findings suggest that isoprenaline stimulate VGEF secretion and subsequently up-regulate the expression of plexin-A1 and VEGFR2 in gastric cancer cells, which form a positive impetus to promote tumor angiogenesis. This study reveals a novel molecular mechanism that a stress signal like isoprenaline may enhance angiogenesis via activating plexin-A1/VEGFR2 signaling pathway in gastric cancer, which may be a potential target in development of an anti-angiogenic therapy for gastric cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study was aimed at understanding whether bronchial biopsy specimen can be used as a surrogate for DNA methylation analysis in surgically resected lung cancer. Methods: A genome-wide methylation was analyzed in 42 surgically resected tumor tissues, 136 bronchial washing, 12 sputum, and 8 bronchial biopsy specimens using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and models for prediction of lung cancer were evaluated using TCGA lung cancer data. Results: Four thousand seven hundred and twenty-six CpGs (P<1.0E-07) that were highly methylated in tumor tissues were identified from 42 lung cancer patients. Ten CpGs were selected for prediction of lung cancer. Genes including the 10 CpGs were classified into three categories: (i) transcription (HOXA9, SOX17, ZNF154, HOXD13); (ii) cell signaling (HBP1, SFRP1, VIPR2); and (iii) adhesion (PCDH17, ITGA5, CD34). Three logistic regression models based on the 10 CpGs classified 897 TCGA primary lung tissues with a sensitivity of 95.0~97.8% and a specificity of 97.4~98.7%. However, the classification performance of the models was very poor in bronchial washing samples: the area under the curve (AUC) was equal to 0.72~0.78. The methylation levels of the 10 CpGs in bronchial biopsy were not significantly different from those in surgically resected tumor tissues (P>0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). However, their methylation levels were significantly different between paired bronchial biopsy and washing (P<0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Conclusions: The present study suggests that bronchial biopsy specimen may be used as a surrogate for DNA methylation analysis in patient with inoperable lung cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, we determined complex indices of inflammatory activity and compared the performance of these indices as prognostic biomarkers in a cohort of breast cancer patients. All proposed composite biomarkers could be evaluated in 418 out of 474 patients in the cohort with complete data on peripheral blood cell count, urinary neopterin, albumin and C-reactive protein. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, systemic inflammatory index, Glasgow prognostic index, modified Glasgow prognostic index, prognostic nutritional index and C-reactive protein/albumin ratio were calculated and further complex indices were proposed. Although a number of the investigated indices were significantly associated with survival in the univariate analysis, only age and stage, but none of the laboratory biomarkers or composite biomarkers, were significant predictors of survival in the whole group in the multivariate analysis. In patients evaluated before the start of the treatment, age, stage and urinary neopterin were significant predictors of survival. These results underscore the importance of neopterin as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "Modern vaccines usually require accompanying adjuvants to increase the immune response to antigens. Aluminum (alum) compounds are the most commonly used adjuvants in human vaccinations for infection diseases. However, alum adjuvants are nondegradable, cause side effects due to the persistence of alum at injection sites, and are rather ineffective for cancer immunotherapy, which requires the Th1 immune response. Recently, we have shown that a plain mesoporous silica (MS) adjuvant can stimulate Th1 anticancer immunity for cancer vaccines. Herein, MS nanospheres doped with Ca, Mg, and Zn (MS-Ca, MS-Mg, and MS-Zn) showed significantly higher degradation rates than pure MS. Moreover, MS-Ca, MS-Mg, and MS-Zn nanospheres stimulated anticancer immune response and increased the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in spleen. The MS-Ca, MS-Mg, and MS-Zn nanospheres with improved biodegradability and excellent ability to induce Th1 anticancer immunity show potential for clinical applications as cancer immunoadjuvants. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Artemin (ARTN) is a member of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, and its signaling is mediated via a multi-component receptor complex including the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored GDNF family receptors a (GFRa1, GFRa3) and RET receptor tyrosine kinase. The major mechanism of ARTN action is via binding to a non-signaling co-receptor. The major function of ARTN is to drive the molecule to induce migration and axonal projection from sympathetic neurons. It also promotes the survival, proliferation and neurite outgrowth of sympathetic neurons in vitro. ARTN triggers oncogenicity and metastasis by the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Recent studies have reported that the expression of ARTN in hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with increased tumor size, quick relapse and shorter survival. Furthermore, ARTN promotes drug resistance such as antiestrogens, doxorubicin, fulvestrant, paclitaxel, tamoxifen and trastuzumab. Moreover, ARTN also stimulates the radio-therapeutic resistance. This review highlights the proposed roles of ARTN in cancer cells and discusses recent results supporting its emerging role as an oncogenic, metastatic and drug-resisting agent with a special focus on how these new insights may facilitate rational development of ARTN for targeted therapies in the future. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "In search of selective and effective anti-cancer agents, eight metabolites of anti-cancer steroid, drostanolone enanthate (1), were synthesized via microbial biotransformation. Enzymes such as reductase, oxidase, dehydrogenase, and hydrolase from Cephalosporium aphidicola, and Fusarium lini were likely involved in the biotransformation of 1 into new metabolites at pH 7.0 and 26°C, yielding five new metabolites, 2a-methyl-3a,14a,17ß-trihydroxy-5a-androstane (2), 2a-methyl-7a-hydroxy-5a-androstan-3,17-dione (3), 2-methylandrosta-11a-hydroxy-1, 4-diene-3,17-dione (6), 2-methylandrosta-14a-hydroxy-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (7), and 2-methyl-5a-androsta-7a-hydroxy-1-ene-3,17-dione (8), along with three known metabolites, 2a-methyl-3a,17ß-dihydroxy-5a-androstane (4), 2-methylandrosta-1, 4-diene-3,17-dione (5), and 2a-methyl-5a-androsta-17ß-hydroxy-3-one (9), on the basis of NMR, and HREI-MS data, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Interestingly, C. aphidicola and F. lini were able to catalyze hydroxylation only at alpha positions of 1. Compounds 1-9 showed a varying degree of cytotoxicity against HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), PC3 (human prostate carcinoma), H460 (human lung cancer), and HCT116 (human colon cancer) cancer cell lines. Interestingly, metabolites 4 (IC50 = 49.5 ± 2.2 μM), 5 (IC50 = 39.8 ± 1.5 μM), 6 (IC50 = 40.7 ± 0.9 μM), 7 (IC50 = 43.9 ± 2.4 μM), 8 (IC50 = 19.6 ± 1.4 μM), and 9 (IC50 = 25.1 ± 1.6 μM) were found to be more active against HeLa cancer cell line than the substrate 1 (IC50 = 54.7 ± 1.6 μM). Similarly, metabolites 2 (IC50 = 84.6 ± 6.4 μM), 3 (IC50 = 68.1 ± 1.2 μM), 4 (IC50 = 60.4 ± 0.9 μM), 5 (IC50 = 84.0 ± 3.1 μM), 6 (IC50 = 58.4 ± 1.6 μM), 7 (IC50 = 59.1 ± 2.6 μM), 8 (IC50 = 51.8 ± 3.4 μM), and 9 (IC50 = 57.8 ± 3.2 μM) were identified as more active against PC-3 cancer cell line than the substrate 1 (IC50 = 96.2 ± 3.0 μM). Metabolite 9 (IC50 = 2.8 ± 0.2 μM) also showed potent anticancer activity against HCT116 cancer cell line than the substrate 1 (IC50 = 3.1 ± 3.2 μM). In addition, compounds 1-7 showed no cytotoxicity against 3T3 normal cell line, while compounds 8 (IC50 = 74.6 ± 3.7 μM), and 9 (IC50 = 62.1 ± 1.2 μM) were found to be weakly cytotoxic. © 2017 Choudhary, Siddiqui, Atia-tul-Wahab, Yousuf, Fatima, Ahmad and Choudhry.",

    "Abstract": "The anticancer properties of ursolic acid (UA) and metformin (Met) have been well demonstrated. However, whether these compounds can act synergistically to prevent and treat cancer is not known. We present in this study, the synergism between UA and Met, and that of a new codrug made of UA and Met (UA-Met) against several cancer cell lines. The combination of high concentration of UA (25, 50, 75, 100 μM) and Met (5, 10, 20, 40 mM) resulted in synergetic cytotoxicity on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (CI < 0.8). Molecular and cellular studies showed that codrug UA-Met significantly inhibited the invasion (~55.3 ± 2.74%) and migration (~52.4 ± 1.57%) of TGF-β induced breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells in vitro at low concentration of 10 μM. These effects were accompanied by down-regulation of CXCR4, uPA, vimentin, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and MMP-2/9 proteins expression and regulation of the AMPK/m-TOR signaling pathways as expected from UA and Met. Moreover, UA-Met could reduce the progression of pulmonary metastasis by 4T1 cells (63.4 ± 3.52%) without influencing the glucose blood level in mice. Our study suggests that the codrug UA-Met is safe and effective in preventing cancer metastasis and possibly treatment of cancer. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Statin treatment of hypercholesterolemia is accompanied also with depletion of the mevalonate intermediates, including farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) necessary for proper function of small GTPases. These include Ras proteins, prevalently mutated in pancreatic cancer. In our study, we evaluated the effect of three key intermediates of the mevalonate pathway on GFP-K-Ras protein localization and the gene expression profile in pancreatic cancer cells after exposure to individual statins. Methods: These effects were tested on MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells carrying a K-Ras activating mutation (G12C) after exposure to individual statins (20 μM). The effect of statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) and mevalonate intermediates on GFP-K-Ras protein translocation was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. The changes in gene expression induced in MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with simvastatin, FPP, GGPP, and their combinations with simvastatin were examined by whole genome DNA microarray analysis. Results: All tested statins efficiently inhibited K-Ras protein trafficking from cytoplasm to the cell membrane of the MiaPaCa-2 cells. The inhibitory effect of statins on GFP-K-Ras protein trafficking was partially prevented by addition of any of the mevalonate pathway's intermediates tested. Expressions of genes involved in metabolic and signaling pathways modulated by simvastatin treatment was normalized by the concurrent addition of FPP or GGPP. K-Ras protein trafficking within the pancreatic cancer cells is effectively inhibited by the majority of statins; the inhibition is eliminated by isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the anticancer effects of statins observed in numerous studies to a large extent are mediated through isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway, as they influence expression of genes involved in multiple intracellular pathways. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Young women diagnosed with breast cancer may be confronted by many difficult decisions, especially around fertility preservation prior to commencing cancer treatment. The information to be conveyed is complex, and it may be difficult to weigh up the risks and benefits of the different fertility preservation options available. This complexity is compounded by the widespread low levels of literacy and health literacy in Australia, which may result in greater difficulties in understanding available health information and in decision-making. Methods/design: A working group of experts have developed a fertility-related online decision aid for a low health literacy population, guided by health literacy principles. The decision aid will be pilot tested with 30 women diagnosed with early breast cancer between 5 years and 6 months previously. To be eligible, at the time of diagnosis, women must be between 18 and 40 years (inclusive), pre-menopausal, have no history of metastatic disease, have not completed their families, be able to give informed consent and have low health literacy. Participants will be asked to reflect back to the time in which they were diagnosed. Participants will complete a questionnaire before and after reviewing the decision aid to determine the feasibility, use and acceptability of the decision aid. The decision aid will be modified accordingly. Participants may also choose to review a previously developed (high literacy) decision aid and provide feedback in comparison to the low health literacy decision aid. Discussion: This project represents the first study to develop an online fertility decision aid developed from low health literacy models in the context of breast cancer. It is anticipated that the low health literacy decision aid will be useful and acceptable to young women with low health literacy who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and that it will be preferred over the high literacy decision aid. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In many phase II trials in solid tumours, patients are assessed using endpoints based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) scale. Often, analyses are based on the response rate. This is the proportion of patients who have an observed tumour shrinkage above a predefined level and no new tumour lesions. The augmented binary method has been proposed to improve the precision of the estimator of the response rate. The method involves modelling the tumour shrinkage to avoid dichotomising it. However, in many trials the best observed response is used as the primary outcome. In such trials, patients are followed until progression, and their best observed RECIST outcome is used as the primary endpoint. In this paper, we propose a method that extends the augmented binary method so that it can be used when the outcome is best observed response. We show through simulated data and data from a real phase II cancer trial that this method improves power in both single-arm and randomised trials. The average gain in power compared to the traditional analysis is equivalent to approximately a 35% increase in sample size. A modified version of the method is proposed to reduce the computational effort required. We show this modified method maintains much of the efficiency advantages. © 2017 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Background: Studies have shown that radiation from radiotherapy increases the yeast colonization of patients. However it is not clear, if such radiation alters the yeast itself. The aim of the present study was therefore to report the direct impact of gamma radiation on Candida tropicalis. Methods: C. tropicalis was obtained from a patient with a carcinoma, a suspension of this yeast containing 2.0 × 103 colony forming units per milliliter was prepared. It was submitted to gamma radiation dosage similar to that used in the treatment of head and neck cancer. After a cumulative dose of 7200 cGy some virulence attributes of C. tropicalis, including macro and micromorphological characteristics, adhesion and biofilm abilities, murine experimental infection and phagocytosis resistance were evaluated on irradiated and non-irradiated yeasts. Results: After irradiation the colony morphology of the yeast was altered from a ring format to a smooth appearance in most colonies. Scanning electron microscopy revealed notable differences in the structures of both these colonies and the yeast cells, with the loss of pseudohyphae following irradiation and an increase in extracellular matrix production. The adherence and biofilm production of the yeast was greater following irradiation, both in terms of the number of yeasts and total biomass production on several abiotic surfaces and TR146 cells. The phagocytic index of the irradiated yeasts was not statistically different; however, the presence of cellular debris was detected in the kidneys of infected animals. Mice infected with irradiated yeasts developed an infection at the site of the yeast inoculation, although systemic infection was unchanged. Conclusions: Our findings show for the first time that C. tropicalis, one of the most important yeasts from colonization, which cause fatal candidemia in cancer patients, is affected by gamma irradiation, with changes to its virulence profile. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The current epidemic of prescription opioid misuse has increased scrutiny of postoperative opioid prescribing. Some 6% to 8% of opioid-näive patients undergoing noncancer procedures develop new persistent opioid use; however, it is unknown if a similar risk applies to patients with cancer. We sought to define the risk of new persistent opioid use after curative-intent surgery, identify risk factors, and describe changes in daily opioid dose over time after surgery. Methods: Using a national data set of insurance claims, we identified patients with cancer undergoing curativeintent surgery from 2010 to 2014. We included melanoma, breast, colorectal, lung, esophageal, and hepato-pancreato-biliary/gastric cancer. Primary outcomes were new persistent opioid use (opioidnäive patients who continued filling opioid prescriptions 90 to 180 days after surgery) and daily opioid dose (evaluated monthly during the year after surgery). Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for new persistent opioid use. Results: A total of 68,463 eligible patients underwent curative-intent surgery and filled opioid prescriptions. Among opioid-naïve patients, the risk of new persistent opioid use was 10.4% (95% CI, 10.1% to 10.7%). One year after surgery, these patients continued filling prescriptions with daily doses similar to chronic opioid users (P =.05), equivalent to six tablets per day of 5-mg hydrocodone. Those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had modestly higher doses (P =.002), but patients with no chemotherapy still had doses equivalent to five tablets per day of 5-mg hydrocodone. Across different procedures, the covariate-adjusted risk of new persistent opioid use in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was 15% to 21%, compared with 7% to 11% for those with no chemotherapy. Conclusion: New persistent opioid use is a common iatrogenic complication in patients with cancer undergoing curative-intent surgery.

    "Abstract": "The development of combined anticancer therapeutic techniques has drawn increased attention for enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In this work, we synthesized Near Infrared (NIR) responsive ICG (I) functionalized hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) as photothermal therapeutic agent (hBNI) and Doxorubicin (Dox)-conjugated Hyaluronic acid (HA) as tumor targeted chemotherapeutic agent (d-HA-Dox). Using adhesion properties of Dopamine (d), the hBNI has been integrated with d-HA-Dox to make a tumor targeted photothermal chemotherapeutic agent (hBNI/d-HA-Dox). The nanostructure of hBNI/d-HA-Dox has been studied using 1H NMR, FTIR, UV–vis-NIR and AFM images. Our in vitro results have provided evidence that hBNI/d-HA-Dox can efficiently damage targeted cancer cells while healthy cells are less affected suggesting that the targeted hBNI/d-HA-Dox nanoparticles work as a complementary antitumor agent with its synergistic co-therapeutic power. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Changes in the coagulation system in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer have been sparsely investigated and the impact of the surgical trauma on the coagulation system is largely unknown in these patients. An increased knowledge could potentially improve the thromboprophylaxis regimes. The aim of this study was to assess the coagulation profile evoked in patients undergoing curative surgery by Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) lobectomy for primary lung cancer. Methods: Thirty-one patients diagnosed with primary lung cancer undergoing VATS lobectomy were prospectively included. The coagulation profile was assessed preoperatively and in the first two days postoperatively using a wide range of standard coagulation tests, dynamic whole blood coagulation measured by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) and thrombin generation evaluated by calibrated automated thrombography. Patients did not receive thromboprophylactic treatment. Data was analyzed using repeated measures one-way ANOVA. Results: The standard coagulation parameters displayed only subtle changes after surgery and the ROTEM® and thrombin generation results remained largely unchanged. Conclusions: Patients undergoing VATS lobectomy are normocoagulable in the preoperative state and a VATS lobectomy does not significantly influence the coagulation. Trial registration: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01741506 ) and at EudraCTno. 2012-002409-23. Registered December 2012. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Reactivity of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene-3- carbonitrile towards thioglycolic acid resulted in thiazole derivative 1. The latter reacted with different chemical reagents to give thiazole, pyrano[2,3-d]thiazole and thiazolo[ 4,5-d]thiazole derivatives. Cytotoxicity effects of the newly synthesized products against six cancer cell lines, namely, human gastric cancer (NUGC), human colon cancer (DLD- 1), human liver cancer (HA22T and HEPG-2), human breast cancer (MCF) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (HONE-1) as well as against a normal fibroblast cell (WI-38) were evaluated. The study showed that the 4,5,6,7 tetrahydrobenzo[ b] thiophene derivatives 6a, 7, 8a,b, 9b and 10b,c w ere t he most active compounds. Their potencies were attributed to the presence of the electron withdrawing groups. © by Amira E. M. Abdallah 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the 10 most incident cancer types in the world, and it is mainly associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption. ESCC mortality rates stand very close to its incidence, which is a direct consequence of a late diagnosis and an inefficient treatment. Although this scenery is quite alarming, the major molecular alterations that drive this carcinogenesis process remain unclear. We have previously shown through the first ESCC methylome analysis that TFF1 promoter is frequently hypermethylated in ESCC. Here, to evaluate TFF1 methylation as a potential biomarker of early ESCC diagnosis, we investigated the status of TFF1 promoter methylation and its expression in ESSC and histologically normal tumor surrounding tissue of ESCC patients in comparison to healthy esophagus of non-cancer individuals. Results: Analysis of TFF1 promoter methylation, and gene and protein expression in 65 ESCC patients and 88 controls revealed that TFF1 methylation levels were already increased in histologically normal tumor surrounding tissue of ESCC patients when compared to healthy esophagus of non-cancer individuals. This increase in DNA methylation was followed by the reduction of TFF1 mRNA expression. Interestingly, TFF1 expression was capable of distinguishing tumor surrounding normal tissue from normal mucosa of healthy individuals with 92% accuracy. In addition, TFF1 protein was undetectable both in tumor and surrounding mucosa by immunohistochemistry, while submucosa glands of the healthy esophagus showed positive staining. Furthermore, treatment of TE-1 and TE-13 ESCC cell lines with decitabine led to a reduction of promoter methylation and consequent upregulation of TFF1 gene and protein expression. Finally, using TCGA data we showed that TFF1 loss is observed in ESCC, but not in esophageal adenocarcinoma, highlighting the different molecular mechanisms involved in the development of each histological subtype of esophageal cancer. Conclusions: This study shows that TFF1 expression is silenced in early phases of ESCC development, which seems to be mediated at least in part by promoter hypermethylation, and provides the basis for the use of TFF1 expression as a potential biomarker for early ESCC detection. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The Iressa Mutation-Positive Multicentre Treatment Beyond ProgRESsion Study (IMPRESS) compared the continuation of gefitinib plus chemotherapy with placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with progression (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1) after first-line gefitinib. Primary results indicated no difference between treatments in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). The current analysis presents final, mature, overall survival (OS) data, together with exploratory analyses that examined whether specific biomarkers, including T790M mutation status, were able to differentiate a relative treatment effect. Patients and Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to gefitinib 250 mg or placebo, in addition to cisplatin 75 mg/m2 plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 (maximum of six cycles of chemotherapy). EGFR mutation status was determined from plasma-derived circulating free tumor-derived DNA samples (beads, emulsification, amplification, and magnetics digital polymerase chain reaction assay, allelic fraction analysis). Results: A total of 265 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned, and overall data maturity was 66%. Continuation of gefitinib plus cisplatin and pemetrexed was detrimental to OS when compared with placebo plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.94;P =.016; median OS, 13.4 v 19.5 months). The detriment was statistically significant inpatients with T790M mutation-positive plasma samples (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.21), whereas statistical significance was not reached in T790M mutation-negative patients (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.94). PFS in T790M mutation-positive patients was similar between treatments, and the difference observed in T790M mutation-negative patients did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.03; P =.0745). Conclusion: Final OS data from IMPRESS are supportive of earlier PFS results and are sufficient to warn physicians against the continuation of treatment with first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors beyond radiologic disease progression when chemotherapy is initiated. Plasma biomarker analyses suggest that this effect may be driven by T790M-positive status. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To investigate the expression, function and significance of long non-coding RNA (IncRNA) CASC19 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to determine the expression of CASC19 in 40 paired samples from CRC surgical specimens and 5 CRC cell lines. The correlations of CASC19 expression with clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed. Tran-swell assay was applied to detect the migration ability of CRC cells after the CASC19 expression was knocked down by small interfering RNA. Results The expression of CASC19 in colorectal cancer was significantly higher than those in adjacent normal mucosa tissues (t = 5. 527, P < 0. 000 1) and was associated with metastasis (P = 0. 044). Knockdown of CASC19 expression in CRC inhibited the migration ability of CRC in vitro. Conclusions The expression of CASC19 increases in CRC. CASC19 expression is not associated with age, gender, or tumor site/differentiation but with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis, suggesting high CASC19 expression may promote CRC metastasis. © 2017 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Weakly basic drugs display poor solubility and tend to precipitate in the stomach's acidic environment causing reduced oral bioavailability. Tracing of these orally delivered therapeutic agents using molecular probes is challenged due to their poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Therefore, we designed a gastric pH stable bile acid derived amphiphile where Tamoxifen (as a model anticancer drug) is conjugated to lithocholic acid derived phospholipid (LCA-Tam-PC). In vitro studies suggested the selective nature of LCA-Tam-PC for cancer cells over normal cells as compared to the parent drug. Fluorescent labeled version of the conjugate (LCA-Tam-NBD-PC) displayed an increased intracellular uptake compared to Tamoxifen. We then investigated the antitumor potential, toxicity, and median survival in 4T1 tumor bearing BALB/c mice upon LCA-Tam-PC treatment. Our studies confirmed a significant reduction in the tumor volume, tumor weight, and reduced hepatotoxicity with a significant increase in median survival on LCA-Tam-PC treatment as compared to the parent drug. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies using LCA-Tam-NBD-PC witnessed the enhanced gut absorption, blood circulation, and tumor site accumulation of phospholipid-drug conjugate leading to improved antitumor activity. Therefore, our studies revealed that conjugation of chemotherapeutic/imaging agents to bile acid phospholipid can provide a new platform for oral delivery and tracing of chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To compare ultrasonic manifestations of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), BI-RADS category 4A atypical fibroadenoma and adenosis. Methods Ultrasonic findings of TNBC group (n=42), BI-RADS 4A atypical fibroadenoma group (n=34) and adenosis group (n=36) were analyzed retrospectively, and statistical analysis was performed. Results There were statistically significant differences of age, tumor size, shape, echo, margin and BI-RADS category between TNBC group and fibroadenoma group (all P<0.016 7). There were statistically significant differences (all P<0.016 7) of age, size, margin, peripheral duct changes, and BI-RADS category between TNBC group and adenosis group. There were statistically significant differences of shape between fibroadenoma group and adenosis group (P<0.016 7). There was no statistically significant difference of boundary, halo, posterior acoustic features, orientation, nor calcification among three groups (all P>0.05). Conclusion TNBC often occurs in women older than 50 years old, and the lesions usually demonstrate larger than 2 cm, very lower echo, and irregular shape with distinct margin. TNBC is usually associated with harder elastography feature, and is classified as more than BI-RADS 4B. Fibroadenoma classified as BI-RADS 4A is most likely to be a mass with lobulated or irregular shape with distinct margin. Adenosis classified as BI-RADS 4A often appears irregular and vertical orientation, which may be confused with breast cancer.

    "Abstract": "Lonidamine (LND) can act on mitochondria and inhibit energy metabolism in cancer cells and therefore has been used together with chemotherapy drugs for synergistically enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, its use is hindered by the poor solubility and slow diffusion in the cytoplasm. To address these problems, we designed and prepared aqueous dispersible nanoparticles (NPs) containing integrated components including triphenylphosphine (TPP) to target the mitochondria of cells and LND and doxorubicin (DOX) for synergistic cancer treatment and conquering drug resistance. This design allows the NPs to concentrate in the mitochondria of cells, solve the low solubility of LND, and contain very high load of LND and DOX in comparison with previously reported drug-delivery systems based on various carrier nanomaterials. Detailed mechanism studies reveal that TPP-LND-DOX NPs could induce significant reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial membrane potential decrease, and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, thereby leading to great cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In vivo anticancer activities indicate that TPP-LND-DOX NPs exhibit the highest efficacy in tumor inhibition among all tested groups and show high effectiveness in drug-resistant model. This work demonstrates the potential use of our TPP-LND-DOX NPs to jointly promote the mitochondria apoptosis pathway and contribute to conquer drug resistance in cancer therapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Multistate models are increasingly being used to model complex disease profiles. By modelling transitions between disease states, accounting for competing events at each transition, we can gain a much richer understanding of patient trajectories and how risk factors impact over the entire disease pathway. In this article, we concentrate on parametric multistate models, both Markov and semi-Markov, and develop a flexible framework where each transition can be specified by a variety of parametric models including exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, Royston-Parmar proportional hazards models or log-logistic, log-normal, generalised gamma accelerated failure time models, possibly sharing parameters across transitions. We also extend the framework to allow time-dependent effects. We then use an efficient and generalisable simulation method to calculate transition probabilities from any fitted multistate model, and show how it facilitates the simple calculation of clinically useful measures, such as expected length of stay in each state, and differences and ratios of proportion within each state as a function of time, for specific covariate patterns. We illustrate our methods using a dataset of patients with primary breast cancer. User-friendly Stata software is provided. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, the model of oxidative damage in colorectal cancer cells was established. After the stimulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the different effects and possible molecular mechanisms of 6-shogoal on H2O2-induced oxidative damage in human intestinal epithelial cells (NCM460) and in situ colon cancer cells (HCT116) cells in vitro were investigated. Inverted microscope was used to observe the changes of cell morphology in HCT116 and NCM460 induced by H2O2 with different concentrations of 6-shogoal. CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) method was used to screen the concentration interval of 6-shogaol and the cell survival rate was determined. Annexin and V-FITC/PI cytometry were used to detect apoptosis of different groups. The expressions of related apoptotic proteins (Caspase-3, poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), MCC1, A2F, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)) were detected by Western-blot. As compared with the model group, 6-shogaol could reduce the expressions of caspase-3, PARP-1, MCC-1, A2F and promote the expression of Bcl-2 (p&lt;0.05) in NCM460 induced by H2O2, indicating that 6-shogaol had anti-oxidant and pro-proliferative effects (p&lt;0.05). However, 6-shogoal could promote the expression of caspase3, PARP-1, MCC1 and A2F, and inhibit the expression of Bcl-2 (p&lt;0.05) in HCT116 induced by H2O2, indicating that 6-shogaol could enhance the oxidative damage of HCT116 induced by H2O2 and inhibit cell proliferation (p&lt;0.05). It could be concluded that 6-shogaol had different opposite effects in NCM460 and HCT116 induced by H2O2, which might provide guidance for further studies on specific mechanisms or pathways of 6-shogoal against colorectal cancer. © 2017, Editorial Board of Modern Food Science and Technology.

    "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of peripheral-blood cell count (PBC)-derived ratios, other biomarkers of inflammation and biomarkers of tumor growth with outcome in a cohort of patients presenting for the next line of therapy after the failure of prior systemic treatment. The data of 51 patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with cetuximab in the second or higher line of therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The median duration of cetuximab therapy and the median survival were 5.1 and 12.1 months, respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP), but not urinary neopterin correlated significantly with PBC-derived ratios. Both CRP and urinary neopterin correlated positively with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations and biomarkers of liver dysfunction. Although a number of parameters predicted overall survival in univariate analysis, only hemoglobin, CEA change and serum bilirubin were independent predictors of survival. In conclusion, in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma and predominantly liver metastases, the outcome of therapy in the advanced line setting was associated with initial hemoglobin level, a decrease of CEA concentration and initial presence of liver dysfunction. Urinary neopterin did not correlate with PBC-derived ratios, in contrast to CRP, but both urinary neopterin and serum CRP concentrations correlated with laboratory parameters of liver dysfunction. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "Anticancer vaccines train the body's own immune system to recognize and eliminate malignant cells based on differential antigen expression. While conceptually attractive, clinical efficacy is lacking given several key challenges stemming from the similarities between cancerous and healthy tissue. Ideally, an effective vaccine formulation would deliver multiple tumor antigens in a fashion that potently stimulates endogenous immune responses against those antigens. Here, it is reported on the fabrication of a biomimetic, nanoparticulate anticancer vaccine that is capable of delivering autologously derived tumor antigen material together with a highly immunostimulatory adjuvant. The two major components, tumor antigens and adjuvant, are presented concurrently in a fashion that maximizes their ability to promote effective antigen presentation and activation of downstream immune processes. Ultimately, it is demonstrated that the formulation can elicit potent antitumor immune responses in vivo. When combined with additional immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockades, the nanovaccine demonstrates substantial therapeutic effect. Overall, the work represents the rational application of nanotechnology for immunoengineering and can provide a blueprint for the future development of personalized, autologous anticancer vaccines with broad applicability. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) functions as a well-known onco-protein to regulate protein conformation, stability and degradation. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a critical regulator of the metabolism, growth and metastasis of cancer cells, has been confirmed to be overexpressed in various human cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic functions of HSP90 and PKM2 overexpression in HCC remain unknown. Methods: The expression of HSP90 and PKM2 in HCC specimens and cells were detected by immunoblotting and immunostaining. The interaction between HSP90 and PKM2 was confirmed by tandem affinity purification, co-immunoprecipitation and Glutathione S transferase (GST)-pulldown assay. Results: In this study, we found that HSP90 could bind to PKM2 and subsequently increased PKM2 abundance in HCC cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed that HSP90 level was positively correlated with PKM2 level in HCC tissues. Mechanistically, HSP90 was found to increase the phosphorylation of PKM2 at Thr-328. Protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) formed a protein complex with HSP90 and PKM2, and directly mediated Thr-328 phosphorylation of PKM2 induced by HSP90. Thr-328 phosphorylation was critical for maintaining PKM2 stability and its biological functions in regulating glycolysis, mitochondria respiration, proliferation and apoptosis. Functionally, we found that HSP90 promoted the glycolysis and proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells in a PKM2 dependent manner. In vivo experiments disclosed that PKM2 was required for the promoting effects of HSP90 on the growth of HCC cells in mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that positive expression of HSP90 and PKM2 was correlated with poor clinicopathological features including high alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, large tumor size, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Furthermore, we demonstrated that positive expression of HSP90 and PKM2, and a combination of these proteins could strongly predict the poor prognosis of HCC patients. Conclusions: We suggest that HSP90 potentiates the glycolysis and proliferation, reduces the apoptosis and thus enhances the growth of HCC cells through PKM2. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: In early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without affected lymph nodes detected at staging, surgical resection is still the mainstay of treatment. However, in patients with metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes (pN2) or non-radically resected primary tumors (R1/R2), postoperative radiotherapy (possibly combined with chemotherapy) is indicated. So far, investigations about time factors affecting postoperative radiotherapy have only examined the waiting time defined as interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy, but not the overall treatment time (OTT) itself. Conversely, results from trials on primary radio(chemo)therapy in NSCLC show that longer OTT correlates with significantly worse local tumor control and overall survival rates. This time factor of primary radio(chemo)therapy is thought to mainly be based on repopulation of surviving tumor cells between irradiation fractions. It remains to be elucidated if such an effect also occurs when patients with NSCLC are treated with postoperative radiotherapy after surgery (and chemotherapy). Our own retrospective data suggest an advantage of shorter OTT also for postoperative radiotherapy in this patient group. Methods/design: This is a multicenter, prospective randomized trial investigating whether an accelerated course of postoperative radiotherapy with photons or protons (7 fractions per week, 2 Gy fractions) improves locoregional tumor control in NSCLC patients in comparison to conventional fractionation (5 fractions per week, 2 Gy fractions). Target volumes and total radiation doses will be stratified in both treatment arms based on individual risk factors. Discussion: For the primary endpoint of the study we postulate an increase in local tumor control from 70% to 85% after 36 months. Secondary endpoints are overall survival of patients; local recurrence-free and distant metastases-free survival after 36 months; acute and late toxicity and quality of life for both treatment methods.

    "Abstract": "Fluoropyrimidines form the chemotherapy backbone of advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). These drugs are frequently associated with toxicity events that result in dose adjustments and even suspension of the treatment. The thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene is a potential marker of response and toxicity to fluoropyirimidines as this enzyme is the molecular target of these drugs. Our aim was to assess the association between variants of TYMS with response and toxicity to fluoropyrimidines in patients with CRC in independent retrospective and prospective studies. Variants namely rs45445694, rs183205964, rs2853542 and rs151264360 of TYMS were genotyped in 105 CRC patients and were evaluated to define their association with clinical response and toxicity to fluoropyrimidines. Additionally, the relationship between genotypes and tumor gene expression was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The 2R/2R (rs45445694) was associated with clinical response (p=0.05, odds ratio (OR)=3.45) and severe toxicity (p=0.0014, OR=5.21, from pooled data). Expression analysis in tumor tissues suggested a correlation between the 2R/2R genotype and low TYMS expression. The allele 2R (rs45445694) predicts severe toxicity and objective response in advanced CRC patients. In addition, the alleles G(rs2853542) and 6bp-(rs151264360) are independent predictors of response failure to chemotherapy. This is the first study made on a Latin American population that points out TYMS gene variants have predictive values for response and toxicity in patients with CRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "Herein, two careful selected anticancer drugs camptothecin (CPT) and cytarabine (Ara-C) with different biological action mechanisms and different water solubility are conjugated together through a glutathione (GSH) cleavable disulfide bond to construct a redox-sensitive drug–drug conjugate, which can self-assemble into nanoparticles, thus notably improving the water solubility of CPT and the cell membrane permeability of Ara-C. Compared with free drugs, the self-assembled CPT-ss-Ara nanoparticles can concentrate in tumor tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, then they can be rapidly internalized by tumor cells and degrade into free drugs for killing the tumor cells when exposed to the reductive environment (GSH) of tumor cells, thereby reducing the injury to normal cells. Meanwhile, the CPT-ss-Ara nanoparticles can effectively protect CPT and Ara-C molecules from biological inactivation before their arrival in tumor microenvironment since free CPT and Ara-C are easy to partly lose their therapy efficacy due to their structure degradation in blood circulation. The in vitro and in vivo anticancer experimental results indicate that simultaneous release of free CPT and Ara-C can realize synergistic chemotherapy effects, thus markedly improve their anticancer activity. Therefore, our designed carrier-free, redox-sensitive CPT-ss-Ara nanoparticles might have promising clinical application to combat cancers. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

    "Abstract": "Background: Palliative care (PC) is an approach that improves the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their families facing the problem associated with incurable terminal disease. A number of QoL assessment tools have been validated in PC and their use described for research purposes, to support clinical practice, and as part of the quality improvement programs. There is a paucity of evidence on the implementation of a nursing intervention focused on QoL assessment in PC practice. The aim of this study is to model and determine the feasibility of a nursing complex intervention focused on QoL assessment in PC practice. Methods: The intervention will be evaluated through a quasi-experimental non-equivalent comparison group before-after study design. This project can be classified as phases 1-2, according to the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. The study setting will take place in two inpatient hospice units in Italy. The study sample will be constituted of 39 multidisciplinary healthcare professionals and a sample of 46 advanced cancer patients admitted to hospices during the implementation of the intervention. Discussion: This study will generate information to address the implementation of QoL measurement in palliative care practice. Findings of this study will be used to inform a phase 3 trial according to the MRC framework. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Phototherapy including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great attention. However, applications of some photosensitizers remain an obstacle by their poor photostability. To enhance the treatment efficiency of photosensitizers and tumor theranostic effect, herein, we reported a novel carrier-free, theranostic nanodrug by self-assembly of small molecule dual anticancer drugs and photosensitizer for tumor targeting. The developed carrier-free small molecule nanodrug delivery system was formed by hydrophobic ursolic acid, paclitaxel, and amphipathic indocyanine green (ICG) associated with electrostatic, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions exhibiting water stability. The self-assembling of ICG on the dual anticancer nanodrug significantly enhanced water solubility of hydrophobic anticancer drugs and ICG photostability contributing to long-term near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and effective chemophototherapy of tumor. The in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging showed that the theranostic nanodrug could be targeted to the tumor site via a potential enhanced permeability and retention effect proving the efficient accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor site. Dramatically, chemophototherapy of tumor-bearing mice in vivo almost completely suppressed tumor growth and no tumor recurrence was observed. Encouraged by its carrier-free, prominent imaging and effective therapy, the small molecule nanodrug via self-assembly will provide a promising strategy for synergistic cancer theranostics. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Different from the common approaches that use either hypothesis test or classifier for biomarker discovery, we applied the integrative hypothesis test (IHT) that combined both to identifying miRNAs for differentiation between lung cancer and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (shortly L-C differentiation) on GEO data set GSE24709, and further extended IHT implementation by bootstrapping aided ranking and mean-variance based reliability check, which outputs a list of the top-15 differentially expressed miRNAs that confirmed the previously reported 14 miRNAs for L-C differentiation from a very different perspective plus an additional one. Moreover, we conducted a literature survey for a further explanation via dividing the 15 miRNAs into subclasses based on known relevances to the two diseases. Also, every pair of 15 miRNAs is exhaustively examined on their joint effect via p-value, misclassification, and correlation, which identifies core pairs and linked cliques as joint miRNAs biomarkers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Polymeric micellar systems are emerging as a very important class of nanopharmaceuticals due to their ability to improve pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of chemotherapy drugs, as well as to reduce related systemic toxicities. While these nanosized delivery systems inherently benefit from passive targeting through the enhanced permeation and retention effect leading to increased accumulation in the tumor, additional active targeting can be achieved through surface modification of micelles with targeting groups specific for overexpressed receptors of tumor cells. In this project, nontoxic, biodegradable, and modularly tunable micellar delivery systems were generated using two types of dendron-polymer conjugates. Either an AB type dendron-polymer construct with 2K PEG or an ABA type dendron-polymer-dendron conjugate with 6K PEG based middle block was used as primary construct; along with an AB type dendron-polymer containing a cRGDfK targeting group to actively target cancer cells overexpressing αÏ...β3/αÏ...β5 integrins. A set of micelles encapsulating docetaxel, a widely employed chemotherapy drug, were prepared with varying feed ratios of primary construct and targeting group containing secondary construct. Critical micelle concentrations of all micellar systems were in the range of 10-6 M. DLS measurements indicated hydrodynamic size distributions varying between 170 to 200 nm. An increase in docetaxel release at acidic pH was observed for all micelles. Enhanced cellular internalization of Nile red doped micelles by MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells suggested that the most efficient uptake was observed with targeted micelles. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and A549 lung carcinoma cell lines showed improved toxicity for RGD containing micelles. For A549 cell line EC50 values of drug loaded micellar sets were in the range of 10-9 M whereas EC50 value of free docetaxel was around 10-10 M. For MDA-MB-231 cell line EC50 value of free docetaxel was 6 × 10-8 M similar to EC50 of nontargeted AB type docetaxel doped micellar constructs whereas the EC50 value of its targeted counterpart decreased to 5.5 × 10-9 M. Overall, in this comparative study, the targeting group containing micellar construct fabricated with a 2 kDa PEG based diblock dendron-polymer conjugate emerges as an attractive drug delivery vehicle due to the ease of synthesis, high stability of the micelles, and efficient targeting. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: To prove the feasibility of integrating CT urography (CTU) into 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and to analyze the impact of CTU on assigning focal tracer accumulation in the ureteric space to either ureteric excretion or metastatic disease concerning topographic attribution and diagnostic confidence. Methods: Ten prostate cancer patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT including CTU because of biochemical relapse or known metastatic disease were retrospectively analyzed. CTU consisted of an excretory phase 10 min after injection of 80 mL iodinated contrast material. Ureter opacification at CTU was evaluated using the following score: 0, 0% opacification; 1, &lt; 50%; 2, 50-99%; 3, 100%. Topographic attribution and confidence of topographic attribution of focal tracer accumulation in the ureteric space were separately assessed for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT without and with CTU. Diagnostic confidence was evaluated using the following score: 0, &lt; 25% confidence; 1, 26-50%; 2, 51-75%; 3, 76-100%. Results: At CTU, mean ureter opacification score was 2.6 ± 0.7. At 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT without CTU, mean confidence of topographic attribution of focal tracer accumulation was 2.5 ± 0.7 in total and 2.6 ± 0.7 for metastatic disease. At 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT with CTU, mean confidence of topographic attribution of focal areas of tracer accumulation was significantly higher with 2.9 ± 0.2 in total and 2.7 ± 0.9 for metastatic disease (p &lt; 0.001). In 4 of 34 findings (12%) attribution to either ureteric excretion or metastatic disease was discrepant between 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT without and with CTU (n.s). Conclusions: Integration of CTU into 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is feasible and increases diagnostic confidence of assigning focal areas of tracer accumulation in the ureteric space to either metastatic disease or ureteric excretion. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This study examined posttraumatic growth (PTG) in young childhood cancer survivors (CCS) and type 1 diabetics (DM), with physically healthy peers as the control group (CG). Anxiety and depression as negative mental outcomes in the three groups, as well as fear of progression in DM and CCS were examined. A total of 107 participants with ages ranging from 18 to 35 years were examined: CCS (n=33), type 1 diabetics (n=39) and peers without a history of chronic disease (n=35). PTG and negative psychosocial outcomes were assessed with self-report questionnaires. There was a significant difference between the groups regarding PTG. On a subscale level DM reported higher appreciation of life (p=0.024), higher personal strength (p=0.010), and more new possibilities (p=0.010) compared to CG. CCS experienced higher spiritual changes than DM (p=0.050). DM reported higher levels of anxiety compared to CCS (p=0.026) and CG (p=0.049). Depression was higher in DM compared to CG (p=0.003). Fear of progression was higher in DM compared to CCS (p<0.001). These findings show that psychological growth was experienced by young CCS and participants with DM. Furthermore, these findings highlight that adolescents with a significant health diagnosis in childhood or youth can undergo a similar or even more positive psychosocial development as peers without a history of chronic disease. However, young type 1 diabetics seem to be a more vulnerable group in terms of anxiety, depression and fear of progression. © 2017 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Invasive mole derives from hydatidiform mole, but its pathogenesis remains unknown. Invasive mole arising from iatrogenic uterine perforation has not been reported yet. Case presentation: A reproductive woman was admitted because she suffered form severe abdominal pain and acute intra-abdominal hemorrhage after suction evacuation due to misdiagnosis as inevitable abortion. The patient underwent hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, by which an iatrogenic uterine perforation and omentum and pelvic peritoneum metastases were confirmed. All lesions were removed and the final pathological diagnosis was metastatic invasive mole. The patient underwent post-operative chemotherapy with methotrexate and presented a good prognosis. Conclusion: Invasive mole arising form iatrogenic uterine perforation displays an unusual metastatic manner other than general invasive moles. The prevention of uterine perforation should be emphasized during suction evacuation for mole pregnancy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The discovery of new intravenous drug delivery carrier for water-insoluble drug is a challenging task. In this paper, novel two-vial formulation of paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded lipid nanoemulsions (TPLEs) with particle sizes of 110 nm (TPLE-1), 220 nm (TPLE-2) and 380 nm (TPLE-3), which were formed by mixing a PEG400 solution of PTX and 10% (w/w) blank lipid emulsions (BLEs) with different particle size prior to use, were developed and comparatively evaluated for their pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficiency. Among them, TPLE-1 displayed higher PTX-loading, slower PTX-release and larger PTX-distribution in oil-phase, significantly reduced extraction by RES organs, increased tumor-uptake, showed stronger cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells and more potent anticancer efficacy on MCF-7 tumor-bearing nude mice, and had greater plasma AUC 0-∞ value, smaller plasma clearance (CL), longer mean residence time (MRT) and elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) in SD rats. It also exhibited the same in vivo efficacy as Taxol ® and even produced less hemolysis and intravenous irritation. Moreover, its LD 50 was 4.3-fold higher than that of Taxol ® . All results demonstrate that TPLE-1 is a promising candidate drug due to its high tumor-accumulation and effectiveness, low toxicity, good safety and druggability in clinical application for the cancer therapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To investigate the predictability of occult lymph node metastasis (OLM) using metabolic parameters of pretreatment 18F-FDG PET-CT in squamous cell lung carcinoma patients manifesting clinical negative node (cN0). Methods A total of 91 cN0 squamous cell lung carcinoma patients who underwent curative surgery and pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT were enrolled retrospectively. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary tumor were obtained with standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold of 2.5. ROC curve analysis was performed to quantify the predictive value of SUVmax, MTV, TLG and the maximal tumor length. To identify risk factors for OLM, univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were performed. Results Of 91 patients, 26 had OLM. Significantly higher SUVmax, MTV, TLG and the maximal tumor length were observed in patients with OLM compared with negative occult lymph node metastasis (all P&lt;0.05). ROC curve showed that the cutoff point of SUVmax, MTV, TLG and the maximal tumor length were 12.76, 31.17 cm3, 153.13 and 3.8 cm, respectively. Univariate analysis showed correlation of tumor location (central), the maximal tumor length, SUVmax, MTV and TLG with the rate of OLM (all P&lt;0.05). In multivariate analysis, tumor location (central), the maximal tumor length &gt;3.8 cm and MTV &gt;31.17 cm3 showed association with increased risk of OLM (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusion MTV in 18F-FDG PET/CT is an independent factor for predicting OLM in patients with cN0 squamous cell lung carcinoma, which can be used to guide surgical planning.

    "Abstract": "Objective To evaluate the efficacy of rituximab in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Methods The clinical data of CLL patients receiving fludarabine, cyclophosphamide ± rituximab (with or without rituximab) regimen or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone ± doxorubicin ± rituximab regimen in our hospital from March 2000 to February 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Therapeutic efficacies and survivals of patients treated with different regimens were evaluated and compared. Results The complete response (CR) rate and the overall response rate (ORR) in 72 patients (43. 6%) treated with rituximab were significantly higher than those treated without rituximab (38. 9% vs. 21.5%, P =0.015; 83. 3% vs. 60.2%, P =0.001). The median PFS and OS for patients treated with rituximab were 53. 0 (27. 0-79. 0) months and 112. 0 (81. 1-142. 9) months, and the median PFS and OS for patients treated without rituximab were 28. 0 (18. 3-37. 7) months and 89. 0 (72. 0-106. 0), but the results were not statistically significant (P = 0. 094, P = 0. 109). According to the cytogenetic features, patients were further divided into high-risk subgroup (with chromosome 17p deletion or llq deletion) and non-high-risk subgroup. And in the high-risk subgroup, the ORR of patients treated with rituximab was 86. 4%, which was significantly higher than that in patients treated without rituximab (53. 3%) (P = 0. 012) ; in the non-high-risk subgroup, the PFS was marginally prolonged in patients treated with rituximab, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 050). Conclusions Compared with traditional chemotherapy, the chemoimmunotherapies with rituximab result in higher CR rate and ORR in CLL patients. In patients without 17p deletion or 11 q deletion, the use of rituximab can marginally prolong PFS. © 2017 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Leiomyoma of the prostate is a rare benign tumor arising from smooth muscle fibers. Most cases are incidental findings observed during pathological examinations after resection of the prostate. To the best of our knowledge, only few studies have reported the conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of such tumors; however, no reports have described the ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) findings of prostatic leiomyomas. Case presentation: We report MR imaging characteristics and surgical pathologic findings of a case of prostatic leiomyoma treated by robot-assisted transperitoneal laparoscopic approach. Typical MR features showed a homogeneous lesion with slightly hypointense signal compared to the skeletal muscle on T2-weighted images, and isointense signal relative to the muscle on T1-weighted images with fat suppression, which collectively demonstrate apparent homogeneous enhancement with a non-enhanced envelope. A slightly hyperintense signal compared to the skeletal muscle was observed on ultra-high b-value DWI, and higher ADC values were observed as compared to the prostate cancer. Conclusions: Prostatic leiomyoma is a benign tumor. This case indicates that MRI features of prostatic leiomyoma are helpful for the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A new kind of free radical-containing dendrimers was synthesized by crosslinked polyamide amine dendrimers with DSP and modified with TEMPO and THPA. The average hydrodynamic size of the product is about 120nm. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the nanoparticles are spherical and the particle size distribution is narrow. The denrimers covalently bounded with TEMPO shows paramagnetic and quasi SOD activity. Compared with TEMPO, TEMPO-containing nanoparticles have low cytotoxicity. Therefore, these nanoparticles could be used as a potential nano-biomaterial applied in the field of diagnosis and cancer therapy. © 2017, Editorial Office, Ion Exchange and Adsorption.

    "Abstract": "Background: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in gliomas and immunosuppressive TAMs are a barrier to emerging immunotherapies. It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue. Results: We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) genes in individual cells. Conclusions: We conclude that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment. Blood-derived TAMs do not universally conform to the phenotype of microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status quo therapeutic strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and in favor of strategies that specifically target immunosuppressive blood-derived TAMs. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: To retrospectively explore the factors influencing Mayo Adhesive Probability (MAP) score in the setting of partial nephrectomy. Material/Methods: Data of 93 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy from September 2015 to June 2016 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Preoperative radiological elements were independently assessed by 2 readers. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate radiological and clinicopathologic influencing factors of MAP score. Results: On univariate analysis, MAP score was associated with male sex, older age, higher body mass index (BMI), history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and perirenal fat thickness (posterolateral, lateral, anterior, anterolateral, and medial). On multivariate analysis, only posterolateral perirenal fat thickness (odds ratio [OR]=0.88 [0.82-0.95], p=0.001), medial perirenal fat thickness (OR=0.90 [0.83-0.98], p=0.01), and history of diabetes mellitus (OR=5.42 [1.74-16.86], p=0.004) remained statistically significant. Tumor type (malignant vs. benign) was not statistically different. In patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), there was no difference in tumor stage or grade. Conclusions: MAP score is significantly correlated with some preoperative factors such as posterolateral and medial perirenal fat thickness and diabetes mellitus. A new radioclinical scoring system including these patient-specific factors may become a better predictive tool than MAP score alone. © Med Sci Monit, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) and their dimers (bis-PBDs) have emerged as some of the most potent chemotherapeutic compounds, and are currently under development as novel payloads in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). However, when used as stand-alone therapeutics or as warheads for small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs), dose-limiting toxicities are often observed. As an elegant solution to this inherent problem, we designed diazepine-ring-opened conjugated prodrugs lacking the imine moiety. Once the prodrug (pro-PBD) conjugate enters a targeted cell, cleavage of the linker system triggers the generation of a reactive intermediate possessing an aldehyde and aromatic amine. An intramolecular ring-closing reaction subsequently takes place as the aromatic amine adds to the aldehyde with the loss of water to give the imine and, as a result, the diazepine ring. In our pro-PBDs, we mask the aldehyde as a hydrolytically sensitive oxazolidine moiety which in turn is a part of a reductively labile self-immolative linker system. To prove the range of applications for this new class of latent DNA-alkylators, we designed and synthesized several novel latent warheads: pro-PBD dimers and hybrids of pro-PBD with other sequence-selective DNA minor groove binders. Preliminary preclinical pharmacology studies showed excellent biological activity and specificity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Previously reported amphiphilic diblock copolymer with pendant dendron moieties (P71D3) has been further evaluated in tumor-bearing mice as a potential drug carrier. This P71D3-based micelle of an average diameter of 100 nm was found to be biocompatible, non-toxic and physically stable in colloidal system up to 15 days. It enhanced the in vitro potency of doxorubicin (DOX) in 4T1 breast tumor cells by increasing its uptake, by 3-fold, compared to free DOX. In 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, the tumor growth rate of P71D3/DOX (2 mg/kg DOX equivalent) treated group was significantly delayed and their tumor volume was significantly reduced by 1.5-fold compared to those treated with free DOX. The biodistribution studies indicated that P71D3/DOX enhanced accumulation of DOX in tumor by 5- and 2-fold higher than free DOX treated mice at 15 min and 1 h post-administration, respectively. These results suggest that P71D3 micelle is a promising nanocarrier for chemotherapeutic agents. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) recognizing CD19 epitopes have produced remarkable anti-tumor effects in patients with B-cell malignancies. However, cancer cells lacking recognized epitopes can emerge, leading to relapse and death. Thus, CAR T cells targeting different epitopes on different antigens could improve immunotherapy. The Lym-1 antibody targets a conformational epitope of Human Leukocyte Antigen-antigen D Related (HLA-DR) on the surface of human B-cell lymphomas. Lym-1 CAR T cells were thus generated for evaluation of cytotoxic activity towards lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Human T cells from healthy donors were transduced to express a Lym-1 CAR, and assessed for epitope-driven function in culture and towards Raji xenografts in NOD-scidIL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice. Lym-1 CAR T cells exhibited epitope-driven activation and lytic function against human B-cell lymphoma cell lines in culture and mediated complete regression of Raji/Luciferase-Green fluorescent protein (Raji/Luc-GFP) in NSG mice with similar or better reactivity than CD19 CAR T cells. Lym-1 CAR transduction of T cells is a promising immunotherapy for patients with Lym-1 epitope positive B-cell malignancies. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland",

    "Abstract": "Efficient delivery of oligonucleotides still remains a challenge in the field of oligonucleotide based therapy. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA), a DNA analogue that is typically synthesized by solid phase peptide chemistry, has been conjugated to a variety of cell penetrating peptides (CPP) as a means of improving its cellular uptake. These CPPs typically deliver their cargoes into cells by an endosomal-dependent mechanism resulting in lower bioavailability of the cargo. Herein, we designed and synthesized PNA-peptide conjugates as splice switching oligonucleotides (SSO) targeting the Mnk2 gene, a therapeutic target in cancer. In humans, the MKNK2 gene, is alternatively spliced, generating isoforms with opposite biological activities: Mnk2a and Mnk2b. It was found that the Mnk2a isoform is down-regulated in breast, lung, brain, and colon tumors and is a tumor suppressor, whereas MnK2b is oncogenic. We have designed and synthesized PNAs that were conjugated to either of the following peptides: A nuclear localization sequence (NLS) or a cytosol localizing internalization peptide (CLIP6). CLIP6-PNA demonstrates effective cellular uptake and exclusively employs a nonendosomal mechanism to cross the cellular membranes of glioblastoma cells (U87). Simple incubation of PNA-peptide conjugates in human glioblastoma cells up-regulates the Mnk2a isoform leading to cancer cell death. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) produced an evidence-based guideline on radiation therapy in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) that was determined to be relevant to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) membership. After applying standard critical appraisal policy and endorsement procedures, ASCO chose to endorse the ASTRO guideline. Methods: The ASTRO guideline was reviewed by ASCO content experts for clinical accuracy and by ASCO methodologists for developmental rigor. On favorable review, an ASCO Expert Panel was convened to review the guideline contents and recommendations. The ASCO guideline approval body, the Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee, approved the final endorsement. Results: The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the ASTRO guideline recommendations, published in July 2017, are clear, thorough, and based upon the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the ASTRO guideline and added minor qualifying statements. Recommendations: Recommendations for the addition of systemic therapy to definitive radiotherapy in the treatment of OPSCC, postoperative radiotherapy with and without systemic therapy following primary surgery of OPSCC, induction chemotherapy in the treatment of OPSCC, and the appropriate dose, fractionation, and volume regimens with and without systemic therapy in the treatment of OPSCC are outlined for a variety of disease stages and clinical scenarios. ASCO Endorsement Panel qualifying statements and minor modifications were made to the ASTRO recommendations. The staging system that is referenced in these guidelines is the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition.

    "Abstract": "Background: For patients with a brain metastasis (BM), systemic therapy is usually administered after the completion of radiotherapy, especially in cases of multiple BMs. However, the role of systemic therapy in patients with a limited number of BMs is not clear. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to explore this question. Methods: Consecutive patients with a pathologically confirmed malignancy and 1-3 intracranial lesions that had been documented within the last decade were selected from the databases of three hospitals in China. Results: A total of 250 patients were enrolled; of them, 135 received radiotherapy alone and 115 received radiotherapy plus systemic therapy. In patients receiving whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) as radiotherapy, 28 received WBRT alone and 35 patients received WBRT plus systemic therapy. Of the patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), 107 received SRS alone and 80 received SRS plus systemic therapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that systemic therapy significantly reduced the risk of mortality compared with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.294, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.158-0.548). Further, when the analysis was conducted in subgroups of WBRT (HR = 0.230, 95% CI = 0.081-0.653) or SRS (HR = 0.305, 95% CI = 0.127-0.731), systemic therapy still showed the ability to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with BMs. Conclusion: Systemic therapy after either SRS or WBRT radiotherapy may significantly reduce the risk of mortality of patients with 1-3 BMs. © 2017 Chinese Medical Journal.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Circular RNAs are a class of endogenous RNAs with various functions in eukaryotic cells. Worthy of note, circular RNAs play a critical role in cancer. Currently, nothing is known about their role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The identification of circular RNAs in HNSCC might become useful for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in HNSCC. Results: Using samples from 115 HNSCC patients, we find that circPVT1 is over-expressed in tumors compared to matched non-tumoral tissues, with particular enrichment in patients with TP53 mutations. circPVT1 up- and down-regulation determine, respectively, an increase and a reduction of the malignant phenotype in HNSCC cell lines. We show that circPVT1 expression is transcriptionally enhanced by the mut-p53/YAP/TEAD complex. circPVT1 acts as an oncogene modulating the expression of miR-497-5p and genes involved in the control of cell proliferation. Conclusions: This study shows the oncogenic role of circPVT1 in HNSCC, extending current knowledge about the role of circular RNAs in cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Different methods are being deployed for non-viral DNA/RNA delivery. However non-viral formulations for DNA/RNA-delivery are often accompanied by severe toxicity and thus low efficiency. Particular costly cell culture media are required as well. Here we introduce sapofection as a valuable enhancing method for non-viral DNA/RNA delivery. Sapofection is based on the application of DNA/RNA nanoplexes and sapofectosid, a plant derived natural transfection reagent. Sapofectosid was produced from plant raw material by chromatographic methods and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry and intensive one and two dimensional NMR-spectroscopy. Sapofectosid did enhance the transfection efficiency of different DNA- and RNA-nanoplexes formulated with liposomes, polyethylenimine (PEI) or targeted and non-targeted oligo-lysine peptides. All nanoplexes were characterized physicochemically and the influence of sapofectosid on the nanoplex integrity was determined by DNA complexation assays. The nanoplexes and sapofectosid were administered to a variety of cancer cell lines and the transfection efficiency was investigated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Dependent on the cell line the transfection efficiencies varied from 6 to 76%. The saponin- and receptor-mediated endocytosis of nanoplexes was investigated by flow cytometry. As demonstrated by impedance based live cell imaging sapofection was non-toxic. The findings show the great potential of sapofection to be used as an effective and non-toxic transfection enhancing method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The invasion and metastasis of tumour cells are closely correlated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. In this study, a CD44 and N-cadherin dual targeting drug delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) has been successfully constructed for inhibiting tumour cell invasion and metastasis. Amino modified MSN (MSN/NH 2 ) was first synthesized and then functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA) and ADH-1, constructing the carrier ADH-1-HA-MSN. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was selected as a model anticancer drug. The prepared vector had a spherical shape with a narrow distribution of particle size. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies showed that the modification with HA significantly enhanced CD44-mediated cellular uptake of this nanocarrier. ADH-1-HA-MSN/DOX exhibited higher cytotoxicity compared to non-ADH-1 modified counterparts. Of note, a transwell chamber assay demonstrated that the migration and invasion of tumour cells were markedly inhibited by ADH-1-HA-MSN/DOX. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis revealed that ADH-1-HA-MSN/DOX inhibited tumour cell invasion and metastasis by down-regulating N-cadherin expression. Taken together, these results indicated that ADH-1-HA-MSN might be a promising targeted drug delivery system for inhibiting cancer invasion and metastasis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment methods for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). It requires exact delineation of the nasopharynx gross tumor volume (GTVnx), the metastatic lymph node gross tumor volume (GTVnd), the clinical target volume (CTV), and organs at risk in the planning computed tomography images. However, this task is time-consuming and operator dependent. In the present study, we developed an end-to-end deep deconvolutional neural network (DDNN) for segmentation of these targets. Methods: The proposed DDNN is an end-to-end architecture enabling fast training and testing. It consists of two important components: an encoder network and a decoder network. The encoder network was used to extract the visual features of a medical image and the decoder network was used to recover the original resolution by deploying deconvolution. A total of 230 patients diagnosed with NPC stage I or stage II were included in this study. Data from 184 patients were chosen randomly as a training set to adjust the parameters of DDNN, and the remaining 46 patients were the test set to assess the performance of the model. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to quantify the segmentation results of the GTVnx, GTVnd, and CTV. In addition, the performance of DDNN was compared with the VGG-16 model. Results: The proposed DDNN method outperformed the VGG-16 in all the segmentation. The mean DSC values of DDNN were 80.9% for GTVnx, 62.3% for the GTVnd, and 82.6% for CTV, whereas VGG-16 obtained 72.3, 33.7, and 73.7% for the DSC values, respectively. Conclusion: DDNN can be used to segment the GTVnx and CTV accurately. The accuracy for the GTVnd segmentation was relatively low due to the considerable differences in its shape, volume, and location among patients. The accuracy is expected to increase with more training data and combination of MR images. In conclusion, DDNN has the potential to improve the consistency of contouring and streamline radiotherapy workflows, but careful human review and a considerable amount of editing will be required. © 2017 Men, Chen, Zhang, Zhang, Dai, Yi and Li.",

    "Abstract": "In cancer research, pretargeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has emerged as an effective two-step approach that combines the excellent target affinity and selectivity of antibodies with the advantages of using short-lived radionuclides such as fluorine-18. One possible approach is based on the bioorthogonal inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazines and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. Here, we report the first successful use of an 18F-labeled small TCO compound, [18F]1 recently developed in our laboratory, to perform pretargeted immuno-PET imaging. The study was performed in an ovarian carcinoma mouse model, using a trastuzumab-tetrazine conjugate. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "As early as 1974, reports have confirmed the anticancer activity of pterin deaminase isolated from fungi. The enzyme has also been reported in bacteria, fungi and slime mold genera, but the enzyme characterization was effetely done. The present study attempted to purify and characterize pterin deaminase enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCIM 3458. The protein was extracted from the extracellular extract by using the ethanol precipitation method. Partial purification of pterin deaminase enzyme was achieved by ion exchange chromatography (Hi-Trap QFF) by fast protein liquid chromatography (AKTA purifier). The molecular weight of the protein was apparently determined by SDS-PAGE, the presence of pterin deaminase was confirmed by activity staining. The purified enzyme was further biochemically characterized. Molecular docking studies showed higher binding affinity towards folic acid interaction. The structural characterization of this protein may open the windows for new drug targets for cancer therapy. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To explore the application value of CEUS in diagnosis of renal occupying lesions. Methods Totally 67 patients with renal occupying lesions underwent conventional ultrasound and CEUS before surgical operation. CEUS enhancement characteristics were observed and compared between 40 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and 14 patients with angiomyolipoma (AML). Meanwhile the time-intensity curves were analyzed, including peak intensity (IMAX), rise time (RT), time-to-peak time (TTP) and mean transit time (mTT). Results There were significant differences in enhancement patterns, degrees, homogeneity of enhancement and pseudocapsule sign between CCRCC and AML (all P<0.01). Compared with AML, IMAX of CCRCC was higher, RT and mTT were both earlier (P<0.05). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CEUS in diagnosis of malignant renal occupying lesions was 91.49% (43/47), 75.00% (15/20) and 86.57% (58/67), respectively. Conclusion CEUS combined with quantitative analysis software is helpful to diagnosis and identification of CCRCC and AML.

    "Abstract": "Background: Recently, the expression of proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) has been shown to be essential for activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)/SMAD-mediated signaling and cell migration by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. However, it is not known whether activation of non-SMAD TGF-β signaling (e.g., RAS–RAF–MEK–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling) is required for cell migration and whether it is also dependent on PAR2. Methods: RNA interference was used to deplete cells of PAR2, followed by xCELLigence technology to measure cell migration, phospho-immunoblotting to assess ERK1/2 activation, and co-immunoprecipitation to detect a PAR2–ALK5 physical interaction. Results: Inhibition of ERK signaling with the MEK inhibitor U0126 blunted the ability of TGF-β1 to induce migration in pancreatic cancer Panc1 cells. ERK activation in response to PAR2 agonistic peptide (PAR2–AP) was strong and rapid, while it was moderate and delayed in response to TGF-β1. Basal and TGF-β1-dependent ERK, but not SMAD activation, was blocked by U0126 in Panc1 and other cell types indicating that ERK activation is downstream or independent of SMAD signaling. Moreover, cellular depletion of PAR2 in HaCaT cells strongly inhibited TGF-β1-induced ERK activation, while the biased PAR2 agonist GB88 at 10 and 100 M potentiated TGF-β1-dependent ERK activation and cell migration. Finally, we provide evidence for a physical interaction between PAR2 and ALK5. Our data show that both PAR2–APand TGF-β1-induced cell migration depend on ERK activation, that PAR2 expression is crucial for TGF-β1-induced ERK activation, and that the functional cooperation of PAR2 and TGF-β1 involves a physical interaction between PAR2 and ALK5. © 2017 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "During lactation, mammary epithelial cells (MECs) form the blood-milk barrier by less-permeable tight junctions (TJs) to prevent the leakage of milk components. Phytoestrogens affect the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of MECs. However, it remains unclear whether phytoestrogens are involved in the blood-milk barrier. Therefore, we investigated the influence of phytoestrogens (coumestrol, genistein, and daidzein) by using an in vitro mouse-MEC-culture model. The results showed that coumestrol and genistein changed the expression of TJ proteins (claudins-3 and -4 and occludin), weakened barrier function, and reduced β-casein production. Daidzein also weakened barrier function without inhibiting β-casein production. Additionally, coumestrol and genistein induced apoptosis in MECs. These results indicate that phytoestrogens weaken the blood-milk barrier by directly affecting TJs and the cellular viability of lactating MECs in different ways. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors have attracted significant attention as promising candidates for highly sensitive, label-free biomolecule detection devices. In this paper, toward practical applications of biosensors, we demonstrate reliable and quantitative detection of a prostate cancer biomarker using the MoS2 FET biosensor in a nonaqueous environment by reducing nonspecific molecular binding events and realizing uniform chemisorption of anti-PSA onto the MoS2 surface. A systematic and statistical study on the capability of the proposed device is presented, and the biological binding events are directly confirmed and characterized through intensive structural and electrical analysis. Our proposed biosensor can reliably detect various PSA concentrations with a limit of 100 fg/mL. Moreover, rigorous theoretical simulations provide a comprehensive understanding of the operating mechanism of the MoS2 FET biosensors, and further suggests the enhancement of the sensitivity through engineering device design parameters. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The synthesis of a novel polymeric surfactant with a repeating disulfide-based gemini structure (poly(gemini surfactant)) and its micellar properties for GSH-dependent intracellular drug delivery are described. A linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) was end-functionalized with N-stearoylcysteine and the cysteine thiol groups of the telechelic surfactant were oxidized intermolecularly in the micellar state to produce poly(gemini surfactant). Compared with the telechelic surfactant, poly(gemini surfactant) possessed a lower critical micelle concentration and higher solubilization capacity for doxorubicin (DOX). Moreover, the poly(gemini surfactant) micelles revealed excellent colloidal stability against excess sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a micelle-destabilizing agent. Cytotoxicity experiments showed that poly(gemini surfactant) composed of PEG, cysteine, and stearic acid was virtually non-cytotoxic up to 100 mg L −1 . In the presence of glutathione (GSH), poly(gemini surfactant) was degraded back into the telechelic surfactant, leading to the release of encapsulated DOX to induce cytotoxicity against cancer cells. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Objective To explore the value of MR texture analysis in differential diagnosis of glioblastoma and solitary metastasis. Methods Thirty-five patients with brain glioblastomas and forty patients with brain metastases confirmed by pathology or clinic were enrolled. All patients underwent conventional MR scan and enhanced examination, including T1 FLAIR, T2WI, T2 FLAIR, DWI, and enhanced T1WI. Texture features of the lesions were extracted with MaZda software by manually drawing ROI on the maximum level of tumor delineation in DWI and enhanced T1WI. Results There were statistical differences between glioblastoma and solitary metastasis of enhanced T1WI skewness in the histogram class texture parameters, gray co-occurrence matrix parameters including enhanced T1WI image correlation, mean and DWI correlation. Logistic regression analysis showed the area under ROC curve of the model was 0.834. Conclusion Texture analysis can provide reliable and quantified objective basis for differential diagnosis of glioblastoma and solitary metastatic brain tumor.

    "Abstract": "DNA-protein conjugates are promising biomolecules for use in areas ranging from therapeutics to analysis because of the dual functionalities of DNA and protein. Conjugation requires site-specific and efficient covalent bond formation without impairing the activity of both biomolecules. Herein, we have focused on the use of a microbial transglutaminase (MTG) that catalyzes the cross-linking reaction between a glutamine residue and a primary amine. In a model bioconjugation, a highly MTG-reactive Gln (Q)-donor peptide (FYPLQMRG, FQ) was fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (FQ-EGFP) and a primary amine-clustered DNA aptamer was enzymatically synthesized as a novel acyl-acceptor substrate of MTG, whose combination leads to efficient and convenient preparation of DNA-protein conjugates with high purity. Dual functionality of the obtained DNA-EGFP conjugate was evaluated by discrimination of cancer cells via c-Met receptor recognition ability of the DNA aptamer. The DNA aptamer-EGFP conjugate only showed fluorescence toward cells with c-Met overexpression, indicating the retention of the biochemical properties of the DNA and EGFP in the conjugated form. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Fisetin has been identified as an anticancer agent with antiangiogenic properties in mice. However, its metabolism in vitro (rat liver microsomes) and in vivo (rats) is presently not characterized. In this study, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed for data acquiring, and a four-step analytical strategy was developed to screen and identify metabolites. First, full-scan was applied, which was dependent on a multiple mass defect filter (MMDF) combined with dynamic background subtraction (DBS). Then PeakView 1.2 and Metabolitepilot 1.5 software were used to load data to seek possible metabolites. Finally, metabolites were identified according to mass measurement and retention time. Moreover, isomers were distinguished based on Clog P parameter. Based on the proposed method, 53 metabolites in vivo and 14 metabolites in vitro were characterized. Moreover, metabolic pathways mainly included oxidation, reduction, hydrogenation, methylation, sulfation, and glucuronidation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To quantitatively observe the value of relationship between nodule and corresponding capsular with ultrasonography in assessment of malignant and benign thyroid nodules. Methods A total of 79 cases with subcapsular tumors of thyroid gland confirmed pathologically were analyzed retrospectively, and the relationship between tumors and capsule was analyzed. Longitudinal diameter of nodules (from the junction of nodule and capsule to the deepest of nodule, V) and distance from nodule protruding thyroid capsule to the highest point of nodule (L) were measured, and L/V was evaluated. Diagnostic efficiency of L/V in diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodule was evaluated. Results The average L/V of benign and malignant nodules was 0.241±0.041 and 0.162±0.054, respectively (t=-7.367, P<0.01). The area under ROC curve of L/V in diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules was 0.87 (P<0.01). When L/V=0.225, the sensitivity was 82.17%, and the specificity was 87.53%; when L/V=0.245, the sensitivity was 67.10%, and the specificity was 95.12%. Conclusion Ultrasonography can clearly show the relationship between thyroid nodules and capsule, and L/V can be used for differential diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules.

    "Abstract": "Background: Our aim was to review our management of inverted papilloma (IP), perform a recurrence analysis, and review the literature. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 247 patients treated for an IP. Patients were grouped according to surgical approach, tumor presentation (primary, residual and recurrence) and Krouse-stage. Results: Recurrence was observed in 20.3%, 28.6% and 35.1% (p = 0.017) of the patients who underwent endoscopic, external and combined surgery, respectively. Recurrences occurred more often in residual than primary IP (36.9% vs. 22.3%, p = 0.021). Primary endoscopic surgery had a recurrence rate of 12.5%, which was comparable to the recent literature (11.2%, 161/1433). Conclusions: The relatively high number of recurrences in this cohort is explained by the long follow-up and previous (incomplete) surgery in 61.5% of the cases. The inferior outcome of residual IP underscores the importance of having a low threshold for preoperative biopsy in unilateral and atypical sinonasal disease. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hyperbranched polymers were successfully used as reductant and stabilizer for the synthesis of stable water-soluble fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) through a one-step bottom-up strategy. The hyperbranched polymers having such performance were acetamide terminated hyperbranched poly(amidoamines) (HPA-Acs) with disulfide functional groups. Small sized (less than 2 nm) AuNCs were formed under the optimal conditions of 80 °C, weak acidic condition (around pH 4.3) for 15–20 h. Through adjusting the feed ratio of HAuCl4 to HPA-Ac, the emitting light could be tuned from yellow to near-infrared. The measurements of UV–vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further verified the formation of AuNCs. The quantum yields of the yellow and near-infrared fluorescent AuNCs were ca. 3.6% and 1.2%, respectively. The as-prepared AuNCs showed an excellent stability in a wide pH range (pH 2–12) and possessed low cytotoxicity for cancer HeLa cell, making it a suitable candidate for bioimaging. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Ideal therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy is obtained only when tumor cells are exposed to a maximal drug concentration, which is often hindered by dose-limiting toxicity. We designed a bubble-generating liposomal delivery system by introducing ammonium bicarbonate and gold nanorods into folic acid-conjugated liposomes to allow both multimodal imaging and the local release of drug (doxorubicin) with hyperthermia. The key component, ammonium bicarbonate, allows a controlled, rapid release of doxorubicin to provide an effective drug concentration in the tumor microenvironment. An in vitro temperature-triggered drug release study showed that cumulative release improved more than two-fold. In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that local heat treatment or ultrasonic cavitation enhanced the therapeutic efficiency greatly. The delivery system could also serve as an excellent contrast agent to allow ultrasonic imaging and computerized tomography imaging simultaneously to further achieve the aim of accurate diagnostics. Results of this study showed that this versatile bubble-generating liposome is a promising system to provide optimal therapeutic effects that are guided by multimodal imaging. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Biological tissues are recurrently exposed to several dynamic mechanical forces that influence cell behavior. On this work, the focus is on the shear stress forces induced by fluid flow. The study of flow-induced effects on cells leads to important advances in cardiovascular, cancer, stem cell, and bone biology understanding. These studies are performed using cell culture flow (CCF) systems, mainly parallel plate flow chambers (PPFC), and microfluidic systems. Here, it is proposed an original CCF system based on the open fluidics concept. The system is developed using a planar superhydrophobic platform with hydrophilic paths. The paths work as channels to drive cell culture medium flows without using walls for liquid confinement. The liquid streams are controlled just based on the wettability contrast. To validate the concept, the effect of the shear stress stimulus in the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells is studied. Combining bone morphogenic protein (specifically BMP-2) stimulation with this mechanical stimulus, a synergistic effect is found on osteoblast differentiation. This effect is confirmed by the enhancement of alkaline phosphatase activity, a well-known early marker of osteogenic differentiation. The suggested CCF system combines characteristics and advantages of both the PPFC and microfluidic systems. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

    "Abstract": "Objective To observe the targeting function of high affinity anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (Cetuximab)-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide-dopamine (anti-EGFR-PEG-SPIO) lung cancer cells via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as the feasibility for surveillance of tumor targeting with MRI. Methods Nanoparticles (NPs) of anti-EGFR-PEG-SPIO and PEG-SPIO were prepared, and the morphology of nanoparticles was observed with transmission electron microscope (TEM). The hydrodynamic diameter and R2 values of nanoparticles before and after conjugation with anti-EGFR were performed with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and MRI. MRI was performed in incubation with anti-EGFR-PEG-SPIO and PEG-SPIO after 2 h in vitro. The cellular uptake of anti-EGFR-PEG-SPIO and PEG-SPIO was further evaluated using Prussian blue staining and TEM. Results Anti-EGFR-PEG-SPIO and PEG-SPIO showed signal intensity of H460 cells on T2WI, decreased significantly compared with PEG-SPIO. The rate of signal intensity change was -58.2%, -82.7%, -94.4% and -98.3%, respectively, at iron concentrations of (0, 10, 20, 40, 80 μg/ml) of anti-EGFR-PEG-SPIO. Prussian blue staining and TEM showed that a lot of intracellular irons of anti-EGFR-PEG-SPIO were observed in H460 cells, but few of PEG-SPIO. Conclusion The effect of active targeting via anti-EGFR in EGFR overexpressed cells can be achieved with anti-EGFR-PEG-SPIO in H460 cells in vitro, and the targeting delivery process could be monitored with 3.0T MRI.

    "Abstract": "Objective To analyze the risk factors of intrauterine adhesion (IUA) after hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps. Methods Totally 359 patients undergoing hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps from January 2013 to December 2016 were enrolled in this study. The clinical data of IUA group and non-IUA group were compared. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the risk factors of IUA, and multivariate Logistic regression analysis was further performed to get the independent risk factors. Results Of these 359 patients, IUA occured after operation in 56 patients (15. 60%). Univariate analysis showed underlying diseases (χ2 = 7. 381, P =0. 004), multiple polyps (χ2 =3. 376, P-0. 040), uterus with uterine fibroids or endometrial hyperplasia (χ2 = 6. 495, P =0.009), history of curettage (χ2 =31.576, P =0.000), pelvic infection (χ2-8. 582, P = 0. 001), intrauterine device (χ2-7. 161, P = 0. 006), history of cesarean section -5. 493, P =0. 014), and multigravida were (χ2 = 16. 886, P = 0. 000) the risk factors of IUA. Lo gistic regression analysis showed other diseases of uterus-19. 542, P = 0. 026), history of curettage (χ2 = 29. 614, P =0.000), pelvic infection (χ2 = 5. 627, P =0.002), intrauterine device (χ2= 11. 342, P =0.08), history of cesarean section (%2 = 8. 549, P = 0. 035), and multigravida (χ2= 15. 493, P = 0. 000) were the independent risk factors of IUA after hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps. Conclusion Other diseases of u-terus, history of curettage, pelvic infection, intrauterine device, history of cesarean section, and/or multigravida can increase the risk of IUA after hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps. © 2017 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a type of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is present in the atmosphere surrounding our environment. Although B[a]P is a procarcinogen, enzymatically metabolized benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) could intercalate into DNA to form bulky BPDE-DNA adducts as an ultimate carcinogenic product in human keratinocytes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of mulberry extract, purified from the fruit of Morus Alba L., on B[a]P-induced cytotoxicity in human keratinocytes and its mechanisms of action. In this study, we confirmed that B[a]P induced nuclear translocation and the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) were decreased by pretreatment of mulberry extract. Mulberry extract could decrease DNA damage through the suppression of B[a]P derived DNA adduct formation and restoration of cell cycle retardation at S phase in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), a major active compound of mulberry extract, showed biological activities to protect the cells from B[a]P exposure, similar to the effectivity of the mulberry extract. These results indicated that the inhibitory effect of C3G against B[a]P inducing skin cancer is attributable to repress the AhR signaling pathway. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between energy value and nutrients intake and the body shape and size parameters (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences) has become an interesting research area for nutritionists and dieticians. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the body shape and size parameters (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences), somatotype (according to the Rohrer (RI) index) and energy value and nutrients intake of women. The study was conducted in 2014 and 2016 on 148 female volunteers aged 57-88 from the Mazovian and Lublin province (Poland). Sample selection was targeted at elderly people with different body types. The exclusion criteria were: multi-organ failure, cancer and disability. Then among the subjects, a survey was conducted, that included demographic data, lifestyle, health status and vitamins and minerals supplements use. Food intake has been assessed using a 3-day dietary food records. The somatotype was determined using the RI with the Curtis key, classifying the subjects as ectomorphic (n=30), mesomorphic (n=31) and endomorphic (n=87). The somatotype was significantly related to place of residence, physical activity, waist and hip circumference, WHR and BMI index, total protein intake, animal protein intake, vitamin E intake (p≤0.05) and to fat, phosphorus and thiamine intake (p≤0.1). The obtained results showed that the place of residence, physical activity, chronic diseases, the use of specialized diet, body weight fluctuations, BMI and WHR were different depending on the somatotype in the examined group of women. Endomorphic subjects had significantly greater waist and hip circumference and diastolic blood pressure compared to the other somatotypes. The somatotype had only a significant effect on total protein, animal protein and vitamin E intake, and ectomorphic elderly women may be particularly susceptible to nutrient deficiencies. Due to the risk of macronutrient, vitamin and mineral deficiencies in the diets of the examined women, it seems necessary to educate this group as well as caregivers and doctors in the area of nutrition adapted to the needs of the elderly. © Anthropological Review 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Interventional embolization is a popular minimally invasive vascular therapeutic technique and has been widely applied for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. However, harmful effects caused by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radioembolization, such as the toxicity of chemotherapy or excessive radiation damage, are serious disadvantages and significantly reduce the therapeutic efficacy. Here, a synergistic therapeutic strategy combined transcatheter arterial embolization and magnetic ablation (TAEMA) by using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-magnetic microspheres (MMs) has been successfully applied to orthotopic VX 2 liver tumors of rabbits. These MMs fabricated by novel rotating membrane emulsification system with well-controlled sizes (100-1000 μm) exhibited extremely low hemolysis ratio and excellent biocompatibility with HepG2 cells and L02 cells. Moreover, experimental results demonstrated that, while exposed to alternating magnetic field (AMF) after TAE, the tumor edge could be heated up by more than 15 °C both in vivo and in vitro, whereas only a negligible increase of temperature was observed in the normal hepatic parenchyma (NHP) nearby. Sufficient temperature increase induces apoptosis of tumor cells. This can further inhibit the tumor angiogenesis and results in necrosis compared to the rabbits only treated with TAE. In stark contrast, tumors rapidly grow and subtotal metastasis occurs in the lungs or kidneys, causing severe complications for rabbits only irradiated under AMF. Importantly, the results from the biochemical examination and the gene expression of relative HCC markers further confirmed that the treatment protocol using PLGA-MMs could achieve good biosafety and excellent therapeutic efficacy, which are promising for liver cancer therapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Depression is one of the most frequent psychiatric complications of Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting up to 50% of the patients. A novel series of hybrid molecules were designed and synthesized by combining the pharmacophoric features of vilazodone and tacrine as potential multitarget-directed ligands for the treatment of AD with depression. In vitro biological assays were conducted to evaluate the compounds; among the 30 hybrids, compound 1e showed relatively balanced profiles between acetylcholinesterase inhibition (IC 50 = 3.319 ± 0.708 μM), 5-HT 1A agonist (EC 50 = 107 ± 37 nM), and 5-HT reuptake inhibition (IC 50 = 76.3 ± 33 nM). Compound 1e displayed tolerable hepatotoxicity and moderate hERG inhibition activity, and could penetrate the blood-brain barrier in vivo. Furthermore, an oral intake of 30 mg/kg 1e·HCl could significantly improve the cognitive function of scopolamine-induced amnesia mice and alleviate the depressive symptom in tail suspension test. The effectivity of 1e validates the rationality of our design strategy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a major efflux transporter overexpressed on multidrug resistant tumor cells and responsible for pumping drugs out. If anti-tumor drugs are given when P-gp level is low, satisfactory treatment efficiency may be achieved. Thus, a P-gp down-regulating siRNA (siMDR1) and doxorubicin (DOX) were applied to eliminate multidrug resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR). A redox-responsive glucolipid conjugate (CSO-ss-SA) was used to condense siRNA (CSO-ss-SA/siRNA) and encapsulate DOX (CSO-ss-SA/DOX) separately. They responded to the high reducing environment of tumor cells and fast released the payload. CSO-ss-SA/siMDR1 silenced MDR1 gene and resulted in a transient decrease of P-gp. Sequentially, DOX formulation (CSO-ss-SA/DOX or DOX·HCl) was delivered when P-gp was reduced to the lowest level. After pretreatment by CSO-ss-SA/siMDR1, cytotoxicity of CSO-ss-SA/DOX and DOX·HCl against MCF-7/ADR cells were 6.4 or 3.4-fold respectively of that treated by DOX·HCl alone, which exhibited increased cytotoxin sensitivity of drug resistant cells and maximized therapeutic outcomes. These results revealed that the sequential treatment strategy of CSO-ss-SA/siRNA and CSO-ss-SA/DOX hold potential in achieving an optimal overcoming multidrug resistance efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Here we present a protocol to study intracellular protein-protein interactions that is based on the widely used biotin-avidin pull-down system. The modification presented includes the combination of this technique with cell-penetrating sequences. We propose to design cell-penetrating baits that can be incubated with living cells instead of cell lysates and therefore the interactions found will reflect those that occur within the intracellular context. Connexin43 (C×43), a protein that forms gap junction channels and hemichannels is down-regulated in high-grade gliomas. The C×43 region comprising amino acids 266-283 is responsible for the inhibition of the oncogenic activity of c-Src in glioma cells. Here we use TAT as the cell-penetrating sequence, biotin as the pull-down tag and the region of Cx43 comprised between amino acids 266-283 as the target to find intracellular interactions in the hard-to-transfect human glioma stem cells. One of the limitations of the proposed method is that the molecule used as bait could fail to fold properly and, consequently, the interactions found could not be associated with the effect. However, this method can be especially interesting for the interactions involved in signal transduction pathways because they are usually carried out by intrinsically disordered regions and, therefore, they do not require an ordered folding. In addition, one of the advantages of the proposed method is that the relevance of each residue on the interaction can be easily studied. This is a modular system; therefore, other cell-penetrating sequences, other tags, and other intracellular targets can be employed. Finally, the scope of this protocol is far beyond protein-protein interaction because this system can be applied to other bioactive cargoes such as RNA sequences, nanoparticles, viruses or any molecule that can be transduced with cell-penetrating sequences and fused to pull-down tags to study their intracellular mechanism of action. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

    "Abstract": "Femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy experiments and density functional theory computations were done for a mechanistic investigation of 3-(1-phenylvinyl)phenol (1) and 3-hydroxybenzophenone (2) in selected solvents. Both compounds went through an intersystem crossing (ISC) to form the triplet excited states T∗ and Tn∗ in acetonitrile but behave differently in neutral aqueous solutions, in which a triplet excited state proton transfer (ESPT) induced by the ISC process is also proposed for 2 but a singlet ESPT without ISC is proposed for 1, leading to the production of the triplet quinone methide (QM) and the singlet excited QM species respectively in these two systems. The triplet QM then underwent an ISC process to form an unstable ground state intermediate which soon returned to its starting material 2. However, the singlet excited state QM went through an internal conversion process to the ground state QM followed by the formation of its final product in an irreversible manner. These differences are thought to be derived from the slow vinyl C-C rotation and the moderate basicity of the vinyl C atom in 1 as compared with the fast C-O rotation and the greater basicity of the carbonyl O atom of 2 after photoexcitation. This can account for the experimental results in the literature that the aromatic vinyl compounds undergo efficient singlet excited state photochemical reactions while the aromatic carbonyl compounds prefer triplet photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. These results have fundamental and significant implications for understanding of the ESPT reactivity in general, as well as for the design of molecules for efficient QM formation in aqueous media with potential applications in cancer phototherapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The pretargeted radioimmunotherapy approach (PRIT) decouples the administration of tumor targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from that of the radiolabeled ligand. This multistep strategy allows delivery of high doses of radiation to tumor cells while minimizing nonspecific normal tissue irradiation. In this study, we evaluated the potential of pretargeted α-particle radioimmunotherapy based on the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz). Two tetrazine based chelators, DOTA-Tz and TCMC-Tz, were synthesized and compared for their radiolabeling efficiency with 212Pb, radiochemical stability, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. Dosimetry was determined from pretargeted biodistribution studies. The PRIT study was carried out in LS174T tumor bearing mice pretargeted with CC49-TCO mAb. After removing unbound mAbs from the blood using two doses of clearing agent, mice were treated with various doses of (0, 2.78, 4.63, 7.40, and 2 × 2.78 MBq) of 212Pb-DOTA-Tz. 212Pb-DOTA-Tz displayed better in vivo biodistribution than 212Pb-TCMC-Tz and was selected for PRIT study. All the mouse groups receiving treatment displayed a dose dependent reduction in tumor size, while the control groups showed exponential tumor growth. Treatment with 2.78, 4.63, and 2 × 2.78 MBq of 212Pb-DOTA-Tz resulted in statistically significant improvement in median survival (26, 35, and 39 days, respectively). Groups receiving 7.40 MBq of 212Pb-DOTA-Tz and 0.55 MBq of direct labeled CC49 exhibited acute radiation associated toxicity. This study successfully demonstrated that pretargeted 212Pb α-particle therapy resulted in reduced tumor growth rates and improved survival with minimal normal tissue toxicity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To explore the value of mammogram texture analysis in prediction of metastasis of axillary lymph nodes for breast carcinoma. Methods Mammograms and clinical data of 171 patients with breast carcinoma confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed, and all patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Then the patients were divided into axillary lymph node metastasis group and non-metastasis group according to the result of ALND. The texture features of these lesions were statistically analyzed, including gray-level histogram texture parameters (mean value, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and variance) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix texture parameters (energy, entropy, correlation, inertia, inverse difference moment and contrast). Results In all of 171 breast cancer patients, 96 patients had axillary lymph node metastasis, while 75 patients had no metastasis. Mammograms showed negative axillary lymph nodes in 119 patients and positive axillary lymph nodes in 52 patients, and the sensitivity and specificity of mammograms in the diagnosis of positive axillary lymph nodes was 48.96% (47/96) and 93.33% (70/75), respectively. Mammogram texture analysis showed the values of energy, entropy, inverse difference moment and correlation in axillary lymph node metastasis group were higher than those in non-metastasis group, while the values of inertia and contrast in the axillary lymph node metastasis group were lower than those in non-metastasis group (all P<0.05). The rest texture parameters had no significant differences between two groups (all P>0.05). Area under curve (AUC) for texture parameters of energy, entropy, inertia, inverse difference moment, correlation and contrast was 0.610, 0.610, 0.374, 0.599, 0.612 and 0.421 (all P<0.05), respectively. AUC of mammography, mammogram texture features, and the combination of mammography and texture features was 0.711, 0.676 and 0.787 (all P<0.05), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of mammogram texture features, the combination of mammography and texture features in diagnosis of axillary lymph nodes metastasis was 62.5% and 64.6%, 66.7% and 82.7%, respectively. Conclusion Mammogram texture parameters are helpful for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis, and the combination of mammography and texture features can improve diagnostic efficiency of axillary lymph node metastasis.

    "Abstract": "Multi-functional nanoshuttles for remotely targeted and on-demand delivery of therapeutic molecules and imaging to defined tissues and organs hold great potentials in personalized medicine, including precise early diagnosis, efficient prevention and therapy without toxicity. Yet, in spite of 25 years of research, there are still no such shuttles available. To this end, we have designed magnetic and gold nanoparticles (NP)-embedded silica nanoshuttles (MGNSs) with nanopores on their surface. Fluorescently labeled Doxorubicin (DOX), a cancer drug, was loaded in the MGNSs as a payload. DOX loaded MGNSs were encapsulated in heat and pH sensitive polymer P(NIPAM-co-MAA) to enable controlled release of the payload. Magnetically-guided transport of MGNSs was examined in: (a) a glass capillary tube to simulate their delivery via blood vessels; and (b) porous hydrogels to simulate their transport in composite human tissues, including bone, cartilage, tendon, muscles and blood-brain barrier (BBB). The viscoelastic properties of hydrogels were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Cellular uptake of DOX-loaded MGNSs and the subsequent pH and temperature-mediated release were demonstrated in differentiated human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as epithelial HeLa cells. The presence of embedded iron and gold NPs in silica shells and polymer-coating are supported by SEM and TEM. Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy documented DOX loading in the MGNSs. Time-dependent transport of MGNSs guided by an external magnetic field was observed in both glass capillary tubes and in the porous hydrogel. AFM results affirmed that the stiffness of the hydrogels model the rigidity range from soft tissues to bone. pH and temperature-dependent drug release analysis showed stimuli responsive and gradual drug release. Cells' viability MTT assays showed that MGNSs are non-toxic. The cell death from on-demand DOX release was observed in both neurons and epithelial cells even though the drug release efficiency was higher in neurons. Therefore, development of smart nanoshuttles have significant translational potential for controlled delivery of theranostics' payloads and precisely guided transport in specified tissues and organs (for example, bone, cartilage, tendon, bone marrow, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and brain) for highly efficient personalized medicine applications. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Chemical modification of proteins is essential for a variety of important diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Many strategies developed to date lack chemo- and regioselectivity as well as result in non-native linkages that may suffer from instability in vivo and adversely affect the protein's structure and function. We describe here the reaction of N-nucleophiles with the amino acid dehydroalanine (Dha) in a protein context. When Dha is chemically installed in proteins, the addition of a wide-range N-nucleophiles enables the rapid formation of amine linkages (secondary and tertiary) in a chemoselective manner under mild, biocompatible conditions. These new linkages are stable at a wide range of pH values (pH 2.8 to 12.8), under reducing conditions (biological thiols such as glutathione) and in human plasma. This method is demonstrated for three proteins and is shown to be fully compatible with disulfide bridges, as evidenced by the selective modification of recombinant albumin that displays 17 structurally relevant disulfides. The practicability and utility of our approach is further demonstrated by the construction of a chemically modified C2A domain of Synaptotagmin-I protein that retains its ability to preferentially bind to apoptotic cells at a level comparable to the native protein. Importantly, the method was useful for building a homogeneous antibody-drug conjugate with a precise drug-to-antibody ratio of 2. The kinase inhibitor crizotinib was directly conjugated to Dha through its piperidine motif, and its antibody-mediated intracellular delivery results in 10-fold improvement of its cancer cell-killing efficacy. The simplicity and exquisite site-selectivity of the aza-Michael ligation described herein allows the construction of stable secondary and tertiary amine-linked protein conjugates without affecting the structure and function of biologically relevant proteins. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The current study was aimed to prepare a molecular complex of erlotinib (ERL) with phospholipid (PC) for enhancement of solubility and thus bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy and reducing the toxicity of erlotinib. Phospholipid complex of drug was prepared by solvent evaporation method and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), proton and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 31P NMR), powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which all explained the interactions of two components, validating the complexation phenomenon. In silico study also supported the phase change and molecular interactions for the establishment of ERL-PC. Spherical shaped nanostructures with 183.37 ± 28.61 nm size, −19.52 ± 6.94 mV potential and 28.59 ± 2.66% loading efficiency were formed following dispersion of ERL-PC in aqueous media. In vitro release study revealed the higher release of ERL-PC due to amorphization and solubilization of drug. Caco-2 cell uptake resulted in ∼2 fold higher uptake of ERL-PC than free drug. In vitro cell culture studies were performed using human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, which demonstrated the higher cytotoxicity and apoptosis in case of ERL-PC. In vivo pharmacokinetics also supported the in vitro observations and showed ∼1.7 fold higher bioavailability with ERL-PC than ERL. Finally, in vivo efficacy and toxicity studies explained the superiority of ERL-PC over the free drug. Based on the results, phospholipid complex appears to be a promising tool to enhance bioavailability, efficacy, cytotoxicity and safety of erlotinib. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Extracts from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge have been used in traditional Asian medicine to treat coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure, atherosclerosis, myocardial infraction, angina pectoris, myocardial ischemia, dysmenorrheal, neurasthenic insomnia, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-RANK signal effect of the combination of S.miltiorrhiza Bunge (SME) and liquefied calcium (LCa) supplement with ovariectomized (OVX-SML) mice, a osteoporosis animal model. Results were compared to 17β-estradiol (E 2 ) treatment. Methods: A total of 70 female ICR strain mice (7weeks) were randomly divided into 10 groups with 7 mice in each group as follows: (1) sham-operated control mice (sham) received daily oral phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) of equal volumes through oral administration. (2) OVX mice received a daily oral administration of PBS (OVX). (3) OVX mice treated daily with 50mg/kg b.w./ day of SME (4) with 100mg/kg b.w./day of SME or (5) with 200mg/kg b.w./day of SME via oral administration. (6) OVX mice treated daily with 50mg/kg b.w./day of SML (7) with 100mg/kg b.w./day of SML or (8) with 200mg/kg b.w./day of SML via oral administration. (9) OVX mice treated daily with 10ml/kg b.w./day of LCa (10) OVX mice received i.p. injections of 17β-estradiol (E 2 ) (0.1mg/kg b.w./day) three times per week for 12weeks. Results: micro-CT analysis revealed that oral administration of SML inhibited tibial bone loss, sustained trabecular bone state, and ameliorated bone biochemical markers. In addition, SML administration compared to SEM and LCa reduced serum levels of RANKL, osteocalcin and BALP through increased serum levels of OPG and E 2 in OVX mice. SML also had more beneficial effects on protection of estrogen-dependent bone loss through blocking expression of TRAF6 and NFTAc1 and produces cathepsin K and calcitonin receptor to develop osteoclast differentiation. Conclusion: These data suggest that S. miltiorrhiza Bunge combined with liquefied calcium supplement has an inhibitory activity in OVX mice. This result implies the possibility of a pharmacological intervention specifically directed toward a diseasesuch as osteoporosis where decreased bone strength increases the risk of a broken bone. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "3-Methyl-6-phenyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin- 4(1H)-one (2), on treatment with phosphorous oxychoride, affored 4-chloro-3-methyl-6-phenyl -thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine- 2(3H)-thione (3). A series of novel 6-phenyl-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivatives 4-9 bearing different functional groups were synthesized via treatment of compound 3 with different reagents. On the other hand, compound 2 was used to synthesize ethyl-[(3-methyl-6-phenyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydrothieno[ 3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-oxy]acetate (10), 2-hydrazinyl- -3-methyl-6-phenyl-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (11), 3-methyl-2-(methyl-sulfanyl)-6-phenyl-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin- 4(3H)-one (12) and N-(phenyl)/4-chlorophenyl or methoxy- phenyl)-2-[(3-methyl-4-oxo-6-phenyl-3,4-dihydrothieno[ 3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)-sulfanyl]-acetamide (13a-c). In addition, compound 12 was used to synthesize thieno[1,2,4] triazolopyrimidine derivatives 14 and 15 and 3-methyl-2-(methyl-sulfonyl)-6-phenyl-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (16) through the reaction with the respective reagents. Moreover, the reaction of 16 with 4-phenylenediamine gave 2-[(4-aminophenyl)-amino]-3-methyl-6-phenyl-thieno[3,2-d] pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (17), which reacted with methanesulfonyl chloride to afford N-{4-[(3-methyl-4-oxo-6-phenyl-3H,4H- -thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)-amino]phenyl}-methanesulfonamide (18). The majority of the newly synthesized compounds displayed potent anticancer activity, comparable to that of doxorubicin, on three human cancer cell lines, including the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa) and colonic carcinoma cell line (HCT- 116). Compounds 18, 13b and 10 were nearly as active as doxorubicin whereas compounds 6, 7b and 15 exhibited marked growth inhibition, but still lower than doxorubicin. © by Hend N. Hafez 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Recent studies indicate that one of four childhood cancers can be attributed to hereditary genetic abnormalities. Methods: The Lund Childhood Cancer Genetic study includes newly diagnosed childhood cancer patients as well as childhood cancer survivors visiting the Department of Pediatrics or the Late Effect Clinic at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Questionnaires regarding family history of cancer and blood samples were provided. Reported data were validated and extended by use of the Swedish Population- and Cancer Registries. Demographics in families with one case of childhood cancer (FAM1) were investigated and compared to families with multiple cases of childhood cancer (FAM > 1) as well as to childhood cancer in the general population. Results: Forty-one out of 528 families (7.8%) had more than one case of childhood cancer. In 23 families the affected children were relatives up to a 3rd degree (4.4%). In FAM > 1, 69.2% of the children with leukemia and 60% of those with tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) had a childhood relative with matching diagnosis, both significantly higher than expected. Significantly more female than male patients were observed in FAM > 1 compared to FAM1. This female predominance was most striking in childhood leukemia (77% female) and also, yet to a lesser extent, in CNS tumors (68% female). Conclusions: We conclude that the high proportion of children with leukemia or CNS tumors in FAM > 1 having a childhood relative with the same diagnosis suggests a hereditary background. Moreover, we report a female predominance in childhood leukemia and childhood CNS tumors in FAM > 1, which may indicate a hereditary gender-specific risk factor in these families. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Case reports, retrospective analyses, and observational studies have linked the use of cisplatin to increased risk of second cancers, especially life-threatening secondary leukemia. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of second cancers associated with receipt of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, trial registers, conference proceedings, review articles, and reference lists of trial publications for all relevant RCTs comparing cisplatin- versus non-cisplatin-containing chemotherapy with data on second cancers. We extracted data about study characteristics and second cancers, especially leukemia/ myelodysplasia. The primary and secondary outcomes were the odds ratios (ORs) for all second cancers and for secondary leukemia/ myelodysplasia, respectively. Results: We identified 28 eligible trials with 7403 patients. Second cancers were reported in 143 patients, including 75 patients in the cisplatin arm and 68 in the non-cisplatin arm (raw event rates of 1.91 and 1.96%, respectively). The pooled OR for risk of all second cancers associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy was 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67-1.33, P = 0.76). Secondary leukemia/ myelodysplasia was reported in 14 patients on cisplatin arms and in 6 patients on non-cisplatin arms of 11 eligible RCTs with 2629 patients (raw event rates of 1.09 and 0.45%, respectively; pooled OR = 2.34, 95%CI 0.97-5.65, P = 0.06). Conclusion: Cisplatin was not associated with a significantly increased risk of second cancers compared with non-cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There is a non-significant trend to increased risk of leukemia/ myelodysplasia and the absolute risk was low. The concern about risk of second cancers should not influence decisions to use an efficacious regimen containing cisplatin. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Circulating concentrations of lipid biomarkers are associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The evidence for a relationship with cancer risk, however, is not entirely consistent. This study aims to assess the relationships of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein (a) (apo(a)), apoB-100, and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) with risk of common cancer forms and total cancer mortality in comparison to incidence and mortality of CVD. Methods: We selected a case-cohort sample out of the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg study, including a random subcohort (n = 2739), and cases of cancer (n = 1632), cancer mortality (n = 761), CVD (n = 1070), and CVD mortality (n = 381). Concentrations of lipid biomarkers were measured in pre-diagnostic blood samples. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models. Results: High levels of circulating apoB-100 and TG were inversely associated and high HDL-C levels were positively associated with breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quartile (Q4 vs. Q1), HRapoB 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98; HRTG 0.65, 0.46-0.92; and HRHDL 1.39, 1.01-1.93). Higher levels of Lp(a) were associated with an increase in prostate cancer risk (Q4 vs. Q1, HRLp(a) 1.43, 1.02-2.03) and high levels of apo(a) were associated with a decrease in lung cancer risk (Q4 vs. Q1, HRapo(a) 0.52, 0.30-0.91). High TC, HDL-C, apo(a), and Lp(a) levels were associated with a reduction in total cancer mortality (Q4 vs. Q1, HRTC 0.71, 0.54-0.94; HRHDL 0.67, 0.50-0.91; HRapo(a) 0.71, 0.54-0.93; and HRLp(a) 0.74, 0.57-0.98). All lipid biomarkers were associated with risk of myocardial infarction, whereby TC, apoB-100, TG, and Lp(a) were positively and HLD-C and apo(a) inversely associated with risk. Only high levels of TG were associated with an increased risk of stroke. None of the lipids were associated with risk of colorectal cancer and with risk of CVD mortality after multivariable adjustments. Conclusions: This prospective study demonstrates inverse associations of lipid biomarkers with cancer incidence and mortality, with the exception of positive associations of HDL-C and Lp(a) with breast and prostate cancer risk, respectively. Thus, the observed cancer risk pattern clearly differs from the CVD risk pattern. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We here describe a selected reaction monitoring (SRM)-based approach for the discovery and validation of peptide biomarkers for cancer. The first stage of this approach is the direct identification of candidate peptides through comparison of proteolytic peptides derived from the plasma of cancer patients or healthy individuals. Several hundred candidate peptides were identified through this method, providing challenges for choosing and validating the small number of peptides that might prove diagnostically useful. To accomplish this validation, we used 2D chromatography coupled with SRM of candidate peptides. We applied this approach, called sequential analysis of fractionated eluates by SRM (SAFE-SRM), to plasma from cancer patients and discovered two peptides encoded by the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIA) gene whose abundance was increased in the plasma of ovarian cancer patients. At optimal thresholds, elevated levels of at least one of these two peptides was detected in 43 (68.3%) of 63 women with ovarian cancer but in none of 50 healthy controls. In addition to providing a potential biomarker for ovarian cancer, this approach is generally applicable to the discovery of peptides characteristic of various disease states.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is one ofthe most common types of cancer in women worldwide. Recent studies have provided strong support for the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, which suggests that many cancers, including breast cancer, are driven by a subpopulation of cells that display stem cell-like properties. The hypothesis that a subpopulation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) possesses many CSC-like hallmarks is reinforced by the expression of related molecular markers between these two cell populations. The aim of this study is to systematically review primary studies and identify circulating CSC markers in breast cancer patients. Methods and design: Relevant observational studies evaluating the expression of circulating breast cancer stem cell markers through October 31, 2016, will be searched in PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar with no restriction on language. Full copies of articles identified by the search and considered to meet the inclusion criteria will be obtained for data extraction and synthesis. Two quality assessment tools will be used for evaluating observational studies like case control, which are the Hoy et al. suggested tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), respectively. Publication bias will be assessed by funnel plots or Egger's test (i.e., plots of study results against precision), and data synthesis will be performed using Stata software (Stata Corp V.12, TX, USA).This systematic review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion: Detecting cancer stem cells in blood will help clinicians to monitor cancer patients by obtaining as many samples as needed with a non-invasive method and in any stages; it is not possible to repeat sampling on working on tissue samples. By identifying cancer stem cells early in blood, it will be possible to distinguish metastasis in early stages. Systematic review registration:CRD42016043810 © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer progression, treatment resistance, and relapse are thought to originate from a small population of tumor cells, breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Identification of factors critical for BCSC function is therefore vital for the development of therapies. Here, we identify the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as a key in vitro and in vivo regulator of BCSC proliferation and self-renewal and establish FOXP1, a winged helix/forkhead transcription factor, as a critical effector of PRMT5-induced BCSC function. Mechanistically, PRMT5 recruitment to the FOXP1 promoter facilitates H3R2me2s, SET1 recruitment, H3K4me3, and gene expression. Our findings are clinically significant, as PRMT5 depletion within established tumor xenografts or treatment of patient-derived BCSCs with a pre-clinical PRMT5 inhibitor substantially reduces BCSC numbers. Together, our findings highlight the importance of PRMT5 in BCSC maintenance and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 or downstream targets could be an effective strategy eliminating this cancer-causing population. Chiang et al. show that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 contributes to breast cancer stem cell function, in part through histone methylation regulating FOXP1 expression. Targeting of PRMT5 through depletion or inhibition reduces stem cell frequency in vitro and in vivo, implicating PRMT5 as important in breast cancer pathogenesis. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "DNA methylation plays crucial roles in chromatin structure and gene expression. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns, including global hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation, are associated with cancer and implicated in oncogenic events. How DNA methylation is regulated in developmental and cellular processes and dysregulated in cancer is poorly understood. Here, we show that PRMT6, a protein arginine methyltransferase responsible for asymmetric dimethylation of histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2me2a), negatively regulates DNA methylation and that PRMT6 upregulation contributes to global DNA hypomethylation in cancer. Mechanistically, PRMT6 overexpression impairs chromatin association of UHRF1, an accessory factor of DNMT1, resulting in passive DNA demethylation. The effect is likely due to elevated H3R2me2a, which inhibits the interaction between UHRF1 and histone H3. Our work identifies a mechanistic link between protein arginine methylation and DNA methylation, which is disrupted in cancer. Veland et al. find that PRMT6, an arginine methyltransferase responsible for histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2) methylation, negatively regulates maintenance DNA methylation by impairing UHRF1 recruitment to chromatin. The authors also find that PRMT6 upregulation contributes to global DNA hypomethylation in cancer cells. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Dysregulated alternative splicing events have been implicated in many types of cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we observe that the splicing factor SRSF1 regulates DBF4B exon6 splicing by specifically binding and promoting its inclusion. Knockdown of the exon6-containing isoform (DBF4B-FL) significantly inhibits the tumorigenic potential of colon cancer cells in vitro and in mice, and SRSF1 inactivation phenocopies DBF4B-FL depletion. DBF4B-FL and SRSF1 are required for cancer cell proliferation and for the maintenance of genomic stability. Overexpression of DBF4B-FL can protect against DNA damage induced by SRSF1 knockdown and rescues growth defects in SRSF1-depleted cells. Increased DBF4B exon6 inclusion parallels SRSF1 upregulation in clinical colorectal cancer samples. Taken together, our findings identify SRSF1 as a key regulator of DBF4B pre-mRNA splicing dysregulation in colon cancer, with possible clinical implications as candidate prognostic factors in cancer patients. Chen et al. find that SRSF1 is a key regulator of DBF4B pre-mRNA splicing in colon cancer cells and demonstrates that SRSF1 prevents DNA damage and promotes tumorigenesis through its regulation of a DBF4B-FL splice variant. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks both early detection biomarkers and viable targeted therapeutics. Moreover, chemotherapy only produces 20-30% pathologic complete response. Because miRNAs are frequently dysregulated in breast cancer and have broad tissue effects, individual or combinations of circulating miRNAs may serve as ideal diagnostic, predictive or prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets. Understanding the role and mechanism of dysregulated miRNAs in TNBC may help to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic strategy for TNBC patients. Methods: The miRNA array profiles of 1299 breast cancer patients were collected from the Metabric database and subjected to analysis of the altered miRNAs between TNBC and non-TNBC. In Student's t-test and Kaplan-Meier analysis, four upregulated miRNAs correlated with poor survival in TNBC but not in non-TNBC. Four miRNAs were manipulated in multiple cell lines to investigate their functional role in carcinogenesis. From these results, we studied miR-105 and miR-93-3p in greater detail. The level of miR-105 and miR-93-3p were evaluated in 25 breast cancer tumor tissues. In addition, the diagnostic utility of circulating miR-105 and miR-93-3p were examined in 12 normal and 118 breast cancer plasma samples by ROC curve construction. Results: miR-105 and miR-93-3p were upregulated and correlated with poor survival in TNBC patients. Both miR-105 and miR-93-3p were found to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling by downregulation of SFPR1. By this action, stemness, chemoresistance, and metastasis were promoted. Importantly, thecombination of circulating miR-105/93-3p may serve as a powerful biomarker for TNBC, even in early-stage disease. Conclusions: miR-105/93-3p activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling by downregulating SFRP1 and thereby promotes stemness, chemoresistance, and metastasis in TNBC cells. Most importantly, combined circulating miR-105/93-3p levels represent a prime candidate for development into a diagnostic biomarker for both early- and late-stage TNBC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "PARP inhibition is known to be an effective clinical strategy in BRCA mutant cancers, but PARP inhibition has not been applied to BRCA-proficient tumors. Here, we show the synergy of BET bromodomain inhibition with PARP inhibition in BRCA-proficient ovarian cancers due to mitotic catastrophe. Treatment of BRCA-proficient ovarian cancer cells with the BET inhibitor JQ1 downregulated the G2-M cell-cycle checkpoint regulator WEE1 and the DNA-damage response factor TOPBP1. Combining PARP inhibitor Olaparib with the BET inhibitor, we observed a synergistic increase in DNA damage and checkpoint defects, which allowed cells to enter mitosis despite the accumulation of DNA damage, ultimately causing mitotic catastrophe. Moreover, JQ1 and Olaparib showed synergistic suppression of growth of BRCA-proficient cancer in vivo in a xenograft ovarian cancer mouse model. Our findings indicate that a combination of BET inhibitor and PARP inhibitor represents a potential therapeutic strategy for BRCA-proficient cancers. Karakashev et al. show synergy of BET bromodomain inhibition with PARP inhibition in BRCA-proficient ovarian cancers. This combination of inhibitors can synergistically increase DNA damage and cell-cycle checkpoint defects, which allows cells to enter mitosis despite the accumulation of DNA damage, ultimately causing mitotic catastrophe. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Most research providing evidence for the role of oncogenic viruses in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development is focused on one type of virus without analyzing possible interactions between two or more types of viruses. The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of co-infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and polyoma BK virus (BKPyV) in oral, oropharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas in Polish patients. The correlations between viral infection, SCC, demographic parameters, evidence of metastases and grading were also investigated. Fresh-frozen tumour tissue samples were collected from 146 patients with laryngeal, oropharyngeal and oral cancer. After DNA extraction, the DNA of the studied viruses was detected using polymerase chain rection (PCR) assay. Males (87.7%) with a history of smoking (70.6%) and alcohol abuse (59.6%) prevailed in the studied group. Histological type G2 was recognized in 64.4% cases. The patients were most frequently diagnosed with T2 stage (36.3%) and with N1 stage (45.8%). Infection with at least two viruses was detected in 56.2% of patients. In this group, co-infection with HPV/EBV was identified in 34.1% of cases, EBV/BKV in 23.2%, HPV/BKV in 22.0%, and HPV/EBV/BKV in 20.7%. No difference of multiple infection in different locations of cancer was observed. The prevalence of poorly differentiated tumours (G3) was more frequent in co-infection with all three viruses than EBV or BKV alone. A significant correlation was observed between tumour dimensions (T) and lymph-node involvement (N) in co-infected patients compared to single infection. Further studies are necessary to clarify whether co-infection plays an important role in the initiation and/or progression of oncogenic transformation of oral, oropharyngeal and laryngeal epithelial cells. © 2017 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "Background: The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for detecting hemoglobin is used widely for noninvasive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, but its sensitivity leaves room for improvement. Objective: To identify novel protein biomarkers in stool that outperform or complement hemoglobin in detecting CRC and advanced adenomas. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Colonoscopy-controlled referral population from several centers. Participants: 315 stool samples from one series of 12 patients with CRC and 10 persons without colorectal neoplasia (control samples) and a second series of 81 patients with CRC, 40 with advanced adenomas, and 43 with nonadvanced adenomas, as well as 129 persons without colorectal neoplasia (control samples); 72 FIT samples from a third independent series of 14 patients with CRC, 16 with advanced adenomas, and 18 with nonadvanced adenomas, as well as 24 persons without colorectal neoplasia (control samples). Measurements: Stool samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify protein combinations that differentiated CRC or advanced adenoma from control samples. Antibody-based assays for 4 selected proteins were done on FIT samples. Results: In total, 834 human proteins were identified, 29 of which were statistically significantly enriched in CRC versus control stool samples in both series. Combinations of 4 proteins reached sensitivities of 80% and 45% for detecting CRC and advanced adenomas, respectively, at 95% specificity, which was higher than that of hemoglobin alone (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Selected proteins could be measured in small sample volumes used in FIT-based screening programs and discriminated between CRC and control samples (P < 0.001). Limitation: Lack of availability of antibodies prohibited validation of the top protein combinations in FIT samples. Conclusion: Mass spectrometry of stool samples identified novel candidate protein biomarkers for CRC screening. Several protein combinations outperformed hemoglobin in discriminating CRC or advanced adenoma from control samples. Proof of concept that such proteins can be detected with antibody-based assays in small sample volumes indicates the potential of these biomarkers to be applied in population screening.

    "Abstract": "KRAS mutant tumors are largely recalcitrant to targeted therapies. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of Kras mutant cancer recapitulate critical aspects of this disease and are widely used for preclinical validation of targets and therapies. Through comprehensive profiling of exomes and matched transcriptomes of >200 KrasG12D-initiated GEMM tumors from one lung and two pancreatic cancer models, we discover that significant intratumoral and intertumoral genomic heterogeneity evolves during tumorigenesis. Known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, beyond those engineered, are mutated, amplified, and deleted. Unlike human tumors, the GEMM genomic landscapes are dominated by copy number alterations, while protein-altering mutations are rare. However, interspecies comparative analyses of the genomic landscapes demonstrate fidelity between genes altered in KRAS mutant human and murine tumors. Genes that are spontaneously altered during murine tumorigenesis are also among the most prevalent found in human indications. Using targeted therapies, we also demonstrate that this inherent tumor heterogeneity can be exploited preclinically to discover cancer-specific and genotype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Focusing on Kras allelic imbalance, a feature shared by all three models, we discover that MAPK pathway inhibition impinges uniquely on this event, indicating distinct susceptibility and fitness advantage of Kras-mutant cells. These data reveal previously unknown genomic diversity among KrasG12D-initiated GEMM tumors, places them in context of human patients, and demonstrates how to exploit this inherent tumor heterogeneity to discover therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

    "Abstract": "Surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence microscopic observation of a live breast cancer cell was performed with a plasmonic chip. Two cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7), were selected as breast cancer cells, with two kinds of membrane protein, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), observed in both cells. The membrane proteins are surface markers used to differentiate and classify breast cancer cells. EGFR and EpCAM were detected with Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled anti-EGFR antibody (488-EGFR) and allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled anti-EpCAM antibody (APC-EpCAM), respectively. In MDA-MB231 cells, three-fold plus or minus one and seven-fold plus or minus two brighter fluorescence of 488-EGFR were observed on the 480-nm pitch and the 400-nm pitch compared with that on a glass slide. Results show the 400-nm pitch is useful. Dual-color fluorescence of 488-EGFR and APC-EpCAM in MDA-MB231 was clearly observed with seven-fold plus or minus two and nine-fold plus or minus three, respectively, on the 400-nm pitch pattern of a plasmonic chip. Therefore, the 400-nm pitch contributed to the dual-color fluorescence enhancement for these wavelengths. An optimal grating pitch of a plasmonic chip improved a fluorescence image of membrane proteins with the help of the surface plasmon-enhanced field. © 2017 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "Background: Accelerated loss of adipose tissue in cancer is associated with shorter survival, and reduced quality of life. Evidence is emerging suggesting tumour association with alterations in adipose tissue, but much less is known about drug-related mechanisms contributing to adipose atrophy. Identification of mechanisms by which tumour and cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, affect adipose tissue are required to develop appropriate therapeutic interventions to prevent fat depletion in cancer. This pre-clinical study aimed to assess alterations in adipose tissue during the clinical course of cancer. Methods: Fischer 344 rats bearing the Ward colorectal tumour were euthanized before chemotherapy, after 1- cycle, or 2-cycles of a combination chemotherapy consisting of Irinotecan (CPT-11) combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which recapitulates first line treatment for human colorectal cancer. Periuterine adipose tissue was isolated. Healthy rats served as a reference group. Histological analysis (hematoxylin and eosin), Real-time PCR (TaqMan) and proteomic analysis (LC-MS/MS) were performed. Results: Larger adipocytes (3993.7 ± 52.6 μm2) in tumour-bearing animals compared to the reference group (3227.7 ± 36.7 μm2; p &lt; 0.001) was associated with reduced expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The presence of a tumour has a significant effect on phospholipid but not triglyceride fatty acid composition. There were greater proportions of saturated fatty acids concurrent with lower monounsaturated fatty acids within the PL fraction of adipocytes in tumour-bearing animals. Chemotherapy treatment decreased the size of adipocytes (2243.9 ± 30.4 μm2; p &lt; 0.001) and led to depletion of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue triglyceride. Evaluation of the proteome profile revealed decreased expression of proteins involved in ATP generation, β-oxidation, and lipogenesis. Overall, adipose tissue may not be able to efficiently oxidize fatty acids to provide energy to maintain energy demanding pathways like lipogenesis inside the tissue. Conclusions: In conclusion, metabolic adaptations to mitochondrial impairment may contribute to diminished lipid storage capacity of adipose tissue following chemotherapy delivery. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The precursor homocysteine is metabolized either through the methionine cycle to produce methionine or through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. Alternatively, cysteine can be obtained through uptake of its oxidized form, cystine. Many cancer cells exhibit methionine dependency such that their proliferation is impaired in growth media in which methionine is replaced by homocysteine. We showed that oncogenic PIK3CA and decreased expression of SLC7A11, a gene that encodes a cystine transporter also known as xCT, correlated with increased methionine dependency in breast cancer cells. Oncogenic PIK3CA was sufficient to confer methionine dependency to mammary epithelial cells, partly by decreasing cystine uptake through the transcriptional and posttranslational inhibition of xCT. Manipulation of xCT activity altered the proliferation of breast cancer cells in methionine-deficient, homocysteine-containing media, suggesting that it functionally contributed to methionine dependency. We propose that concurrent with decreased cystine uptake through xCT, PIK3CA mutant cells use homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. Consequently, less homocysteine is available to produce methionine, contributing to methionine dependency. These results indicate that oncogenic PIK3CA alters methionine and cysteine utilization, partly by inhibiting xCT to contribute to the methionine dependency phenotype in breast cancer cells.

    "Abstract": "Tumor tissues are chronically exposed to hypoxia owing to aberrant vascularity. Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation is a hallmark of hypoxic cancer cells, yet how LDs form and function during hypoxia remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that in various cancer cells upon oxygen deprivation, HIF-1 activation down-modulates LD catabolism mediated by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the key enzyme for intracellular lipolysis. Proteomics and functional analyses identified hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (HIG2), a HIF-1 target, as a new inhibitor of ATGL. Knockout of HIG2 enhanced LD breakdown and fatty acid (FA) oxidation, leading to increased ROS production and apoptosis in hypoxic cancer cells as well as impaired growth of tumor xenografts. All of these effects were reversed by co-ablation of ATGL. Thus, by inhibiting ATGL, HIG2 acts downstream of HIF-1 to sequester FAs in LDs away from the mitochondrial pathways for oxidation and ROS generation, thereby sustaining cancer cell survival in hypoxia. © Molaro and Malik.",

    "Abstract": "Muscle weakness and cachexia are significant paraneoplastic syndromes of many advanced cancers. Osteolytic bone metastases are common in advanced breast cancer and are a major contributor to decreased survival, performance, and quality of life for patients. Pathologic fracture caused by osteolytic cancer in bone (OCIB) leads to a significant (32%) increased risk of death compared to patients without fracture. Since muscle weakness is linked to risk of falls which are a major cause of fracture, we have investigated skeletal muscle response to OCIB. Here, we show that a syngeneic mouse model of OCIB (4T1 mammary tumor cells) leads to cachexia and skeletal muscle weakness associated with oxidation of the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca2+) release channel (RyR1). Muscle atrophy follows known pathways via both myostatin signaling and expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, atrogin-1 and MuRF1. We have identified a mechanism for skeletal muscle weakness due to increased oxidative stress on RyR1 via NAPDH oxidases [NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4)]. In addition, SMAD3 phosphorylation is higher in muscle from tumor-bearing mice, a critical step in the intracellular signaling pathway that transmits TGFβ signaling to the nucleus. This is the first time that skeletal muscle weakness has been described in a syngeneic model of OCIB and represents a unique model system in which to study cachexia and changes in skeletal muscle. © 2017 Regan, Mikesell, Reiken, Xu, Marks, Mohammad, Guise and Waning.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Myeloid cells are an abundant leukocyte in many types of tumors and contribute to immune evasion. Expression of the enzyme arginase 1 (Arg1) is a defining feature of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and leads to depletion of L-arginine, a nutrient required for T cell and natural killer (NK) cell proliferation. Here we use CB-1158, a potent and orally-bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of arginase, to investigate the role of Arg1 in regulating anti-tumor immunity. Methods: CB-1158 was tested for the ability to block myeloid cell-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation in vitro, and for tumor growth inhibition in syngeneic mouse models of cancer as a single agent and in combination with other therapies. Tumors from animals treated with CB-1158 were profiled for changes in immune cell subsets, expression of immune-related genes, and cytokines. Human tumor tissue microarrays were probed for Arg1 expression by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cancer patient plasma samples were assessed for Arg1 protein and L-arginine by ELISA and mass spectrometry, respectively. Results: CB-1158 blocked myeloid cell-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation in vitro and reduced tumor growth in multiple mouse models of cancer, as a single agent and in combination with checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, adoptive NK cell therapy, and the chemotherapy agent gemcitabine. Profiling of the tumor microenvironment revealed that CB-1158 increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and NK cells, inflammatory cytokines, and expression of interferon-inducible genes. Patient tumor samples from multiple histologies expressed an abundance of tumor-infiltrating Arg1+ myeloid cells. Plasma samples from cancer patients exhibited elevated Arg1 and reduced L-arginine compared to healthy volunteers. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that Arg1 is a key mediator of immune suppression and that inhibiting Arg1 with CB-1158 shifts the immune landscape toward a pro-inflammatory environment, blunting myeloid cell-mediated immune evasion and reducing tumor growth. Furthermore, our results suggest that arginase blockade by CB-1158 may be an effective therapy in multiple types of cancer and combining CB-1158 with standard-of-care chemotherapy or other immunotherapies may yield improved clinical responses. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Tumor-derived autophagosome vaccines (DRibbles) have the potential to broaden immune response to poorly immunogenic tumors. Methods: Autologous vaccine generated from tumor cells harvested from pleural effusions was administered to patients with advanced NSCLC with the objectives of assessing safety and immune response. Four patients were vaccinated and evaluable for immune response; each received two to four doses of vaccine. Study therapy included two cycles of docetaxel 75mg/m2 on days 1 and 29 to treat the tumor, release hidden antigens and produce lymphopenia. DRibbles were to be administered intradermally on days 14, 43, 57, 71, and 85, together with GM-CSF (50 μg/d x 6d, administered via SQ mini pump). Peripheral blood was tested for immune parameters at baseline and at each vaccination. Results: Three of four patients had tumor cells available for testing. Autologous tumor-specific immune response was seen in two of the three, manifested by IL-5 (1 patient after 3 doses), and IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-10 (after 4 doses in one patient). All 4 patients had evidence of specific antibody responses against potential tumor antigens. All patients came off study after 4 or fewer vaccine treatments due to progression of disease. No significant immune toxicities were seen during the course of the study. Conclusions: DRibble vaccine given with GM-CSF appeared safe and capable of inducing an immune response against tumor cells in this small, pilot study. There was no evidence of efficacy in this small poor-prognosis patient population, with treatment not feasible. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Development of resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a major problem in treatment of various cancers including pancreatic cancer. In this study, we reveal important resistance mechanisms and photochemical strategies to overcome 5-FU resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Methods: 5-FU resistant (5-FUR), epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like sub-clones of the wild type pancreatic cancer cell line Panc03.27 were previously generated in our lab. We investigated the cytotoxic effect of the endosomal/lysosomal-localizing photosensitizer TPCS2a (fimaporfin) combined with light (photochemical treatment, PCT) using MTS viability assay, and used fluorescence microscopy to show localization of TPCS2a and to investigate the effect of photodamage of lysosomes. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to investigate uptake of photosensitizer and to assess intracellular ROS levels. Expression and localization of LAMP1 was assessed using RT-qPCR, western blotting, and structured illumination microscopy. MTS viability assay was used to assess the effect of combinations of 5-FU, chloroquine (CQ), and photochemical treatment. Expression of CD105 was investigated using RT-qPCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy, and co-localization of TPCS2a and anti-CD105-saporin was assessed using microscopy. Lastly, the MTS assay was used to investigate cytotoxic effects of photochemical internalization (PCI) of the anti-CD105-immunotoxin. Results: The 5-FUR cell lines display hypersensitivity to PCT, which was linked to increased uptake of TPCS2a, altered lysosomal distribution, lysosomal photodamage and increased expression of the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 in the 5-FUR cells. We show that inhibition of autophagy induced by either chloroquine or lysosomal photodamage increases the sensitivity to 5-FU in the resistant cells. The three 5-FUR sub-clones overexpress Endoglin (CD105). Treatment with the immunotoxin anti-CD105-saporin alone significantly reduced the viability of the CD105-expressing 5-FUR cells, whereas little effect was seen in the CD105-negative non-resistant parental cancer cell lines. Strikingly, using the intracellular drug delivery method photochemical internalization (PCI) by combining light-controlled activation of the TPCS2a with nanomolar levels of CD105-saporin resulted in strong cytotoxic effects in the 5-FUR cell population. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that autophagy is an important resistance mechanism against the chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU in pancreatic cancer cells, and that inhibition of the autophagy process, either by CQ or lysosomal photodamage, can contribute to increased sensitivity to 5-FU. For the first time, we demonstrate the promise of PCI-based targeting of CD105 in site-specific elimination of 5-FU resistant pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In conclusion, PCI-based targeting of CD105 may represent a potent anticancer strategy and should be further evaluated in pre-clinical models. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of all gynecological cancers, and there is an urgent unmet need to develop new therapies. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized by an immune suppressive microenvironment, and response of ovarian cancers to immune therapies has thus far been disappointing. We now find, in a mouse model of EOC, that clinically relevant doses of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors (DNMTi and HDACi, respectively) reduce the immune suppressive microenvironment through type I IFN signaling and improve response to immune checkpoint therapy. These data indicate that the type I IFN response is required for effective in vivo antitumorigenic actions of the DNMTi 5-azacytidine (AZA). Through type I IFN signaling, AZA increases the numbers of CD45+ immune cells and the percentage of active CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor microenvironment, while reducing tumor burden and extending survival. AZA also increases viral defense gene expression in both tumor and immune cells, and reduces the percentage of macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment. The addition of an HDACi to AZA enhances the modulation of the immune microenvironment, specifically increasing T and NK cell activation and reducing macrophages over AZA treatment alone, while further increasing the survival of the mice. Finally, a triple combination of DNMTi/HDACi plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor α-PD-1 provides the best antitumor effect and longest overall survival, and may be an attractive candidate for future clinical trials in ovarian cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women living in Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). This study examines cervical cytology using a liquid-based cytology (LBC) method and reports the presence of high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV). Methods: We collected cervical samples from 1475 asymptomatic and healthy volunteers from six hospitals in Lao PDR. A total of 1422 volunteers (mean age 39.1 ± 6.4 years, range 30-54 years) were included in the final analysis. We performed HPV typing using the polymerase chain reaction technique to detect HR-HPV samples with abnormal cytology. Results: The overall rates of abnormal cytology and HR-HPV-positive in the samples were 9.3% (132/1422) and 47.7% (63/132), respectively. The samples with abnormal cytology included 13 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and one squamous cell carcinoma case. The results showed that the most common type of HPV was HPV16 (20.5%) followed by HPV58 (9.1%). Conclusions: Healthy women in Vientiane, the capital of Lao PDR, have high rates of abnormal cervical cytology and are likely to be HR-HPV-positive. A system for detection and prevention of cervical cancer in these women should be developed in the near future. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The internal mammary (IM) lymph node chain, along with the axillary nodal basin, is a first-echelon breast lymphatic draining site. A growing body of evidence supports irradiation of this region in node-positive breast cancer. This study evaluated the effectiveness of radiotherapy in treating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected abnormal IM lymph nodes in newly-diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer. Methods: A structured query was performed on an electronic institutional database to identify women with radiographic evidence of abnormal IM node(s) on breast MRI from 2005 to 2013. Manual review narrowed inclusion to patients with a primary diagnosis of non-metastatic breast cancer with abnormal IM node(s) based on pathologic size criteria and/or abnormal enhancement. Results: Of the 7070 women who underwent pre-treatment MRI, 19 (0.3%) were identified on imaging to have a total of 25 abnormal pre-treatment IM lymph nodes, of which 96% were located in the first two intercostal spaces and 4% in the third space. A majority of the primary tumors were high-grade (94.7%) and hormone-receptor negative (73.7%), while 47.4% overexpressed HER-2/neu receptor. Axillary nodal disease was present in 89.5% of patients, while one patient had supraclavicular involvement. At a median follow-up of 38 months, 31.6% of patients had developed metastatic disease and 21.1% had died from their disease. Of the patients who received IM coverage, none had progressive disease within the IM lymph node chain. Conclusions: Radiologic evidence of pre-treatment abnormal IM chain lymph nodes was associated with advanced stage, high grade, and negative estrogen receptor status. The majority of positive lymph nodes were located within the first two intercostal spaces, while none were below the third. Radiation of the IM chain in combination with modern systemic therapy was effective in achieving locoregional control without surgical resection in this cohort of patients. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants in approximately 40 susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer (CRC), there are few studies on the interactions between identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle risk factors. We evaluated whether smoking could modify associations between these genetic variants and CRC risk. Methods: A total of 703 CRC patients and 1406 healthy controls were included in this case-control study from the National Cancer Center in Korea. Thirty CRC susceptibility SNPs identified in previous GWAS were genotyped. A logistic regression model was used to examine associations between the SNPs and smoking behaviors by sex. The interaction was estimated by including an additional interaction term in the model. Results: In men, an increased CRC risk was observed for longer durations (OR&gt;28 vs. ≤28years = 1.49 (95% CI = 1.11-1.98)), greater quantities (OR≥20 vs. &lt;20cigarettes/day = 2.12 (1.61-2.79)), and longer pack-years of smoking (OR≥21 vs. &lt;21pack-years = 1.78 (1.35-2.35)). In women, longer pack-years of smoking significantly increased CRC risk (OR≥5 vs. &lt;5pack-years = 6.11 (1.10-34.00)). Moreover, there were significant interactions between smoking status and the polymorphisms rs1957636 at 14q22.3 (P interaction = 5.5 × 10-4) and rs4813802 at 20p12.3 (P interaction = 0.04) in men. Interactions between smoking status and the rs6687758 at 1q41 (P interaction = 0.03), duration and the rs174537 at 11q12.2 (P interaction = 0.05), and pack-years and the rs4813802 (P interaction = 0.04) were also found in women. Conclusions: Associations between susceptibility SNPs and CRC risk may be modified by smoking behaviors, supporting the existence of gene-smoking interactions. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Integrated PET/MRI is a hybrid imaging technique enabling clinicians to acquire diagnostic images for tumor assessment and treatment monitoring with both high soft tissue contrast and added metabolic information. Integrated PET/MRI has shown to be valuable in the clinical setting and has many promising future applications. The protocol presented here will provide step-by-step instructions for the acquisition of whole-body 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI data in children with cancer. It also provides instructions on how to combine a whole-body staging scan with a local tumor scan for evaluation of the primary tumor. The focus of this protocol is to be both comprehensive and time-efficient, which are two ubiquitous needs for clinical applications. This protocol was originally developed for children above 6 years, or old enough to comply with breath-hold instructions, but can also be applied to patients under general anesthesia. Similarly, this protocol can be modified to fit institutional preferences in terms of choice of MRI pulse sequences for both the whole-body scan and local tumor assessment. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",

    "Abstract": "The T-box 19 (TBX19) gene encodes a transcription factor characterized by a highly conserved DNA-binding motif (T-box). Recent studies have revealed that TBX19 has been identified as one of the genes activated by KRAS mutations, and is upregulated in colon adenoma. These results indicate that TBX19 may work as an oncogene in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the expression and role of TBX19 have yet to be investigated. Here, we investigated TBX19 mRNA and protein expressions in colon cancer cells or surgically resected CRC. We found that TBX19 mRNA expression was significantly increased in tumorous tissues compared to that in non-tumorous tissues, and increased TBX19 mRNA expression was associated with positive lymph node metastasis in our cohort. The expression of TBX19 mRNA was not correlated with that of TBX19 protein in tissue sample taken from the CRC patients. Moreover, TBX19 showed positive staining even in the normal colonic tissues and the adjacent non-tumorous tissues. These results suggest that the expression of TBX19 protein is not correlated with the expression of TBX19 mRNA. In addition, our results promote further investigations into the impact of TBX19 upregulation on colorectal carcinogenesis, as well as the underlying mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Background: We previously demonstrated that the local immune status correlated with the glioma prognosis. Interleukin-6 (IL6) was identified as an important local immune-related risk marker related to unfavourable prognosis. In this study, we further investigated the role and regulation of IL6 signalling in glioma. Methods: The expression and prognostic value of IL6 and the IL6 receptor (IL6R) were explored in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and REMBRANDT databases and clinical samples. Functional effects of genetic knockdown and overexpression of IL6R or IL6 stimulation were examined in vitro and in tumours in vivo. The effects of the nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFAT1) on the promoter activities of IL6R and IL6 were also examined. Results: High IL6- and IL6R-expression were significantly associated with mesenchymal subtype and IDH-wildtype gliomas, and were predictors of poor survival. Knockdown of IL6R decreased cell proliferation, invasion and neurosphere formation in vitro, and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. IL6R overexpression or IL6 stimulation enhanced the invasion and growth of glioma cells. TCGA database searching revealed that IL6- and IL6R-expression were correlated with that of NFAT1. In glioma cells, NFAT1 enhanced the promoter activities of IL6R and IL6, and upregulated the expression of both IL6R and IL6. Conclusion: NFAT1-regulated IL6 signalling contributes to aggressive phenotypes of gliomas, emphasizing the role of immunomodulatory factors in glioma malignant progression. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Since the anticancer drugs have diverse inhibited mechanisms to the cancer cells, the use of two or more kinds of anticancer agents may achieve excellent therapeutic effects, especially to the drug-resistant tumors. Results: In this study, we developed a kind of dual drug [methotrexate (MTX) and 10-hydroxycamptothecine (HCPT)] loaded nanoneedles (DDNDs) with pronounced targeting property, high drug loading and prolonged drug release. The anti-solvent precipitation of the HCPT and MTX modified PEG-b-PLGA (PEG-b-PLGA-MTX, PPMTX) leads to nucleation of nanoneedles with nanocrystalline HCPT as the core wrapped with PPMTX as steric stabilizers. In vitro cell uptake studies showed that the DDNDs revealed an obviously targeting property and entered the HeLa cells easier than the nanoneedles without MTX modification. The cytotoxicity tests illustrated that the DDNDs possessed better killing ability to HeLa cells than the individual drugs or their mixture in the same dose, indicating its good synergistic effect and targeting property. The in vivo studies further confirmed these conclusions. Conclusions: This approach led to a promising sustained drug delivery system for cancer diagnosis and treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of fluorouracil, which is a common agent used in the management of many solid tumor malignancies. Dermatologic reaction is common with various chemotherapy agents but is not commonly reported in the use of capecitabine. When adverse reactions of rashes occur, the offending agent is typically removed. We report here an unusual case of photosensitive lichenoid rash due to capecitabine which is managed conservatively without major alteration in treatment. Case presentation: Seventy-three year old female with a diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer undergoing management with capecitabine presents with a rash during the summer months that is biopsy proven to be lichenoid photosensitive rash with likely offending agent being capecitabine. Her treatment was initially held despite having response to treatment, started on topical steroids after evaluation by dermatology. Given her response to treatment, drug was resumed with instructions to use sun precaution, sunscreen, and to complete course of topical steroids until rash resolution. Conclusion: Drug-related rashes tend to lead to disruptions or alterations in treatments of malignancies, despite responses. Given the wide use of capecitabine in many different solid tumors, it is important to recognize this photosensitive related skin rash and to initiate appropriate precautions of sun safety and topical steroids to allow minimal disruptions in therapy and continue use of capecitabine. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Preliminary evidence suggests that changes in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels may contribute to the occurrence of chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment (CACI), and a previous study suggested that carriers of the BDNF Met homozygous genotype are protected from CACI. Methods: This multicenter, prospective cohort study involved chemotherapy-receiving early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) patients. Self-perceived cognitive function was longitudinally assessed using the validated FACT-Cog (ver. 3) across three time points: Prior to chemotherapy (T1), during chemotherapy (T2), and at the end of chemotherapy (T3). Plasma BDNF levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genotyping was performed using Sanger Sequencing. Results: A total of 51 chemotherapy-receiving ESBC patients (mean age: 52.6 ± 9.5 years) were recruited, and 11 patients (21.6%) reported subjective cognitive impairment post-chemotherapy. Overall, there was a reduction in median plasma BDNF levels over time (T1: 5423.0 pg/ml; T2: 5313.6 pg/ml; T3: 4050.3 pg/ml; p < 0.01). After adjusting for confounding factors, longitudinal analysis revealed that BDNF levels were associated with self-reported concentration deficit (p = 0.032). Carriers of Val/Val (p = 0.011) and Val/Met (p = 0.003) BDNF genotypes demonstrated a significant reduction in plasma BDNF levels over time; however, plasma BDNF levels were similar across all time points among Met homozygous carriers (p = 0.107). Conclusion: There was a statistically significant change in BDNF levels post-chemotherapy in ESBC patients, and plasma BDNF levels were associated with self-perceived concentration deficit in patients receiving chemotherapy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In vivo electroporation (EP) has reignited the clinical interest on DNA vaccines as immunotherapeutic approaches to control different types of cancer. EP has been associated with increased immune response potency, but its capacity in influencing immunomodulation remains unclear. Here we evaluated the impact of in vivo EP on the induction of cellular immune responses and therapeutic effects of a DNA vaccine targeting human papillomavirus-induced tumors. Our results demonstrate that association of EP with the conventional intramuscular administration route promoted a more efficient activation of multifunctional and effector memory CD8 + T cells with enhanced cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, EP increased tumor infiltration of CD8 + T cells and avoided tumor recurrences. Finally, our results demonstrated that EP promotes local migration of antigen presenting cells that enhances with vaccine co-delivery. Altogether the present evidences shed further light on the in vivo electroporation action and its impact on the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Coiled-coil domain containing 34 (CCDC34) promotes cell proliferation and invasive properties in human cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the expression of CCDC34 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal pancreatic tissue, and to evaluate the prognostic significance of CCDC34 expression in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, using bioinformatics. Material/Methods: The expression and prognostic value of CCDC34 were initially predicted using Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples (N=90) and matched normal pancreatic tissues (N=90) were studied using immunohistochemistry to measure CCDC34 protein expression levels. Univariate Kaplan-Meier, and multivariate Cox analysis were used to determine the prognostic role of CCDC34 expression. Results: Oncomine and TCGA databases predicted that CCDC34 mRNA expression levels were significantly increased in pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with normal pancreatic tissues (P<0.05), and that patients with increased CCDC34 mRNA expression levels had significantly lower overall survival (OS) (P=0.031). Immunohistochemistry showed that expression levels of CCDC34 protein in pancreatic adenocarcinoma were significantly increased, compared with normal pancreas (P=0.000). Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with increased expression of tissue CCDC34 had significantly reduced OS compared with patients with low expression (P=0.000). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis showed that increased expression of CCDC34 was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (all, P=0.000). Conclusions: Compared with normal pancreas, CCDC34 expression was significantly increased in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and increased CCDC34 expression was an independent predictor of poor patient prognosis. © Med Sci Monit, 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the preliminary applicability of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) score in the condition of 3.0T multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (Mp-MRI) combined with clinical classic indicators for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: The clinical and MRI materials of 247 patients of suspicious prostate disease treated in Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2015 to November 2016 were analyzed retrospectively, including 110 cases with PCa and 137 cases without cancer. All cases underwent the high-resolution axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhancement-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and were confirmed pathologically by puncture biopsies. The Mp-MRI materials of all cases were scored according to PI-RADS v2.The prostate volume and prostate specific antigen (PSA) density (PSAD) value were calculated according to the formulas. The univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for the observed indicators (age, prostate volume, PSA, PSAD and PI-RADS v2 score) to determine the independent predictors for PCa. Then, a Logistic regression model (combined prediction model) was established by the independent predictors for combined diagnosis of PCa. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve analysis was performed to get the sensitivity and specificity of each independent predictor and the model to diagnose PCa. The differences of AUC values of each independent predictor and the model were compared with each other to evaluate the diagnostic performance for PCa. Results: The differences in the age, prostate volume, PSA, PSAD and the PI-RADS v2 score between patients with PCa and non-cancer group were all statistically significant (t=2.870, Z=-4.230, -7.787, -9.477, -10.826, all P&lt;0.05). The PSAD and PI-RADS v2 score were independent predictors for PCa (OR=3.331, 10.546, both P&lt;0.05). The Logistic regression combined prediction model by PI-RADS v2 score and PSAD to forecast PCa was Logit(P)=-5.097+ 2.309×PSAD+ 1.214×PI-RADS v2 score. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC in the combined model (0.911) was higher than that in the PI-RADS v2 score (0.886) and PSAD (0.851) and the differences were all statistically significant (Z=2.416, 2.716, both P&lt;0.05); but the difference in the AUC value between PI-RADS v2 score and PSAD was not statistically significant (Z=1.191, P=0.234). The diagnostic sensitivity of PSAD, PI-RADS v2 score and the model were: 0.891, 0.782 and 0.855, respectively; the specificity were 0.449, 0.912 and 0.847, respectively on their positive thresholds (0.15 μg·L-1·ml-1, 4 and -0.82). Conclusion: PI-RADS v2 score combined with PSAD in diagnosing PCa is superior to the single application of them and it can lead to high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for PCa.

    "Abstract": "Background: Metastasis is a major threat to colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We have reported that peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) is associated with CRC invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms regulating PRDX2 expression remain unclear. We investigate whether microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate PRDX2 expression in CRC progression. Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to measure microRNA-200b-3p (miR-200b-3p) expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect c-Myc and PRDX2 protein levels in CRC tissue samples (n = 97). Western blot was used to quantify PRDX2, c-Myc, AKT2/GSK3β pathway-associated proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins in CRC cells. Luciferase reporter assays were used to analyze the interaction between miR-200b-3p and 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of PRDX2 mRNA and AKT2 mRNA as well as c-Myc and the miR-200b-3p promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to evaluate binding of c-Myc to the miR-200b-3p promoter. Invasive assay and metastatic model were used to assess invasive and metastatic capacities of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, drug-induced apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Results: We found that miR-200b-3p was significantly downregulated, whereas c-Myc and PRDX2 were upregulated in metastatic CRC cells and CRC tissues compared to their counterparts. An inverse correlation existed between c-Myc and miR-200b-3p, and between miR-200b-3p and PRDX2. We also found that PRDX2 was a target of miR-200b-3p. Importantly, overexpression of nontargetable PRDX2 eliminated the suppressive effects of miR-200b-3p on proliferation, invasion, EMT, chemotherapeutic resistance and metastasis of CRC cells. Moreover, c-Myc bound to the promoter of miR-200b-3p and repressed its transcription. In turn, miR-200b-3p disrupted the stability of c-Myc protein by inducing c-Myc protein threonine 58 (T58) phosphorylation and serine 62 (S62) dephosphorylation via AKT2/GSK3β pathway. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that the c-Myc/miR-200b/PRDX2 loop regulates CRC progression and its disruption enhances tumor metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance in CRC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: \"Horchata\" is an herbal mixture infusion consumed in Southern Ecuador; 66% of its plants are anti-inflammatory medicinal plant, and 51% are analgesics. Anti-inflammatory substances can prevent carcinogenesis mediated by cytotoxic effects and can prevent DNA damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and apoptotic/antigenotoxic effects of horchata as well as its mechanism. Methods: Nine different varieties of horchata were prepared in the traditional way and then freeze-dried. Phytochemical screening tested for the presence of secondary metabolites using standard procedures and antioxidant activities. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated on cerebral astrocytoma (D-384), prostate cancer (PC-3), breast cancer (MCF-7), colon cancer (RKO), lung cancer (A-549), immortalized Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), and human peripheral blood lymphocytes via a MTS assay. The pro-apoptotic effects were evaluated with Anexin V/Propidium Iodide and western blot of Bax, Bcl-2, TP53, and TP73. Induction and reduction of ROS were assessed by fluorimetry. Genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects were evaluated with a comet assay and micronuclei on binucleated cells. Results: Five of nine horchatas had cytotoxic effects against D-384 while not affecting normal cells. These horchatas induce cell death by apoptosis modulated by p53/p73. In CHO-K1 cells, the horchatas decrease the damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and Mitomycin C measured in the comet and micronucleus assay respectively. Conclusions: The IC50 range of effective horchatas in D-384 was 41 to 122 μg·mL-1. This effect may be related to its use in traditional medicine (brain tonic). On the other hand, immortalized Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) and lymphocytes did not show a cytotoxic effect. The most potent horchata induced apoptosis via a p53/p73-mediated mechanism. The horchatas present antigenotoxic properties, which may be related to the antioxidant capacity. Future studies on horchata components are necessary to understand the interactions and beneficial properties. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The presence of microvascular invasion (McVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been proposed as a cause of recurrence and poor survival, although this has not been officially emphasized in staging systems. Thus, we conducted a retrospective study to investigate the prognostic importance of McVI in tumor staging in patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC at our center from 1994 to 2012. Patients with HCC were classified into four groups based on the presence of McVI and extent of gross vascular invasion (VI). Results: The 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates of 676 patients were 63.3 and 42.6%, respectively. There was no difference in tumor recurrence or survival rate between patients with HCC and McVI without gross VI and those with gross VI confined to segmental/sectional branches. Multivariate analysis revealed that the extent of VI based on the presence of McVI and gross VI was independently associated with tumor recurrence and overall survival. Conclusions: McVI was revealed to be an important risk factor similar to gross VI confined to a segmental/sectional branch in patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection. This finding should be considered when estimating the stage for prognosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A novel mitoxantrone conjugate was synthesized by coupling mitoxantrone with ionic liquid tags, and cytotoxic behavior of the designed conjugate was studied in normal and cancer cell lines. The synthesized mitoxantrone conjugate was oil at physiological temperatures and demonstrated high aqueous solubility. Sensitivity of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to the mitoxantrone conjugate was improved by an order of magnitude, in comparison with original mitoxantrone dihydrochloride. The observed ESI-MS signals were shifted to a \"clearer\" lower-mass region of the spectrum, which allowed investigation of the drug at the level of individual cells. The ionic liquid tags proposed in the present work consist of an easily available imidazolium salt residue and show a number of key advantages from the points of view of drug conjugate synthesis, drug delivery and analytic detection. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The immunosuppressive protein PD-L1 is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to evasion of the host immune system. The relative importance of the tumor microenvironment and cancer cell-intrinsic signaling in the regulation of PD-L1 expression remains unclear. We report that oncogenic RAS signaling can upregulate tumor cell PD-L1 expression through a mechanism involving increases in PD-L1 mRNA stability via modulation of the AU-rich element-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP). TTP negatively regulates PD-L1 expression through AU-rich elements in the 3′ UTR of PD-L1 mRNA. MEK signaling downstream of RAS leads to phosphorylation and inhibition of TTP by the kinase MK2. In human lung and colorectal tumors, RAS pathway activation is associated with elevated PD-L1 expression. In vivo, restoration of TTP expression enhances anti-tumor immunity dependent on degradation of PD-L1 mRNA. We demonstrate that RAS can drive cell-intrinsic PD-L1 expression, thus presenting therapeutic opportunities to reverse the innately immunoresistant phenotype of RAS mutant cancers. Coelho et al. demonstrate a post-transcriptional mechanism whereby oncogenic RAS signaling increases PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, PD-L1 mRNA is targeted by TTP through AU-rich elements in the 3′ UTR, making it unstable. Oncogenic RAS signaling reduces TTP activity and stabilizes the PD-L1 transcript. Restoring TTP activity reduces PD-L1 expression and enhances anti-tumor immunity. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To study tumors and fertility outcomes after fertility-sparing surgical treatment with borderline ovarian tumors (BOT). Methods: One hundred and nineteen patients with BOT enrolled from 3 hospitals between January 2004 and January 2017 were analysed retrospectively.The clinical data and follow-up results were obtained and analyzed. Results: Among the 119 BOT patients, 55 patients underwent fertility-sparing surgery.The median age was 43 years (interquartile range: 15-80 years). There were 103 patients (86.55%) in stage I, and 16 patients (13.45%) in stage Ⅱ and above.The median follow up time was 68 months (range: 4-155). (1)Tumor outcomes: 13 patients recurred and 3 patients died.Progression free survival (PFS) and the overall survival rate had no significant difference between the two groups (85.45% vs 92.19% P=0.309, 96.4% vs 98.4% P=0.492). PFS was related to FIGO stage, invasive implantation and chemotherapy by univariate analysis (P<0.05). The multivariate Cox regression model analysis showed that FIGO stage and invasive implantation were independent prognostic factors for PFS (P<0.05). (2) Pregnancy outcomes: 28 patients had a planned for pregnancy in fertility-sparing group, with 13 (46.43%) of them were pregnancy. Conclusions: FIGO stage and invasive implantation were the important factors of prognosis.Fertility-sparing surgery is safe and feasible to preserve the fertility of young patients.

    "Abstract": "The importance of miRNAs in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) has further been supported by the finding that miRNAs have been identified as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressors in PCa. Indeed, in eukaryotes, miRNAs have been found to regulate and control gene expression by degrading mRNA at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-34 family members, miR-34b and miR-34c, in different PCa cell lines, and discussed the molecular mechanism of miR-34b in the invasion and migration of PCa cells in vitro. The difference analyses of the transcriptome between the DU145 and PC3 cell lines demonstrated that both miR-34b and -34c target critical pathways that are involved in metabolism, such as proliferation, and migration, and invasion. The molecular expression of miR-34b/c were lower in PC3 cells. Moreover, over-expression of miR-34b/c in PC3 cells caused profound phenotypic changes, including decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, the players that regulate expression levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), TGF-β receptor 1 (TGF-βR1), and p53 or phosphorylation levels of mothers against decapentaplegic 3 (SMAD3) in the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway have yet to be elucidated, and will provide novel tools for diagnosis and treatment of metastatic PCa. © 2017 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "Background: There has been a significant improvement in survival of advanced malignancies with the advent of checkpoint inhibitors. These newer treatment modalities come with a wide spectrum of unique side effects, termed immune related adverse events (irAE), ranging from mild skin rash to severe colitis. Included in that spectrum is the rare side effect of autoimmune diabetes mellitus. Despite a few case reports illustrating the incidence of autoimmune diabetes associated with immunotherapy, there has not been much mentioned about exacerbation or acceleration of hyperglycemia in non-autoimmune settings leading to de novo diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Case presentation: We report the case of a 42 year old man with metastatic melanoma and no prior history of diabetes mellitus, who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after 3 cycles of combination checkpoint inhibitor therapy using nivolumab and ipilimumab. New onset diabetes mellitus was diagnosed on the basis of elevated hemoglobin A1c, in the absence of prior personal or family history. Autoimmune or type 1 diabetes mellitus was ruled out with normal levels of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibody, zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) antibody, and islet antigen-2 (IA-2) antibody. Conclusions: This case report highlights the importance of recognizing rare but serious adverse events related to immunotherapy and incorporation of appropriate tools for early identification and management in national cancer treatment guidelines. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has garnered immense attention as a minimally invasive clinical treatment modality for malignant cancers. However, its low penetration depth and photodamage of living tissues by UV and visible light, which activate a photosensitizer, limit the application of PDT. In this study, monodisperse NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanospheres 20 nm in diameter, that serve as near-infrared (NIR)-to-visible light converters and activators of a photosensitizer, were synthesized by high-temperature co-precipitation of lanthanide chlorides in a high-boiling organic solvent (octadec-1-ene). The nanoparticles were coated with a thin shell (≈3 nm) of homogenous silica via the hydrolysis and condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate. The NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2 particles were further functionalized by methacrylate-terminated groups via 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate. To introduce a large number of reactive amino groups on the particle surface, methacrylate-terminated NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2 nanospheres were modified with a branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) via Michael addition. Aluminum carboxyphthalocyanine (Al Pc-COOH) was then conjugated to NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI nanospheres via carbodiimide chemistry. The resulting NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI-Pc particles were finally modified with succinimidyl ester of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in order to alleviate their future uptake by the reticuloendothelial system. Upon 980 nm irradiation, the intensive red emission of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI-Pc-PEG nanoparticles completely vanished, indicating efficient energy transfer from the nanoparticles to Al Pc-COOH, which generates singlet oxygen (1O2). Last but not least, NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI-Pc-PEG nanospheres were intratumorally administered into mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-231 growing subcutaneously in athymic nude mice. Extensive necrosis developed at the tumor site of all mice 24–48 h after irradiation by laser at 980 nm wavelength. The results demonstrate that the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI-Pc-PEG nanospheres have great potential as a novel NIR-triggered PDT nanoplatform for deep-tissue cancer therapy. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are promising drug targets for a variety of therapeutic applications. Herein we describe the design, synthesis, biological evaluation in cellular models of cancer, and preliminary drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies (DMPK) of a series of secondary and tertiary N-substituted 7-aminoheptanohydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors. Introduction of an amino group with one or two surface binding groups (SBGs) yielded a successful strategy to develop novel and potent HDAC inhibitors. The secondary amines were found to be generally more potent than the corresponding tertiary amines. Docking studies suggested that the SBGs of tertiary amines cannot be favorably accommodated at the gorge region of the binding site. The secondary amines with naphthalen-2-ylmethyl, 5-phenylthiophen-2-ylmethyl, and 1H-indol-2-ylmethyl (2 j) substituents exhibited the highest potency against class I HDACs: HDAC1 IC50 39–61 nm, HDAC2 IC50 260–690 nm, HDAC3 IC50 25–68 nm, and HDAC8 IC50 320–620 nm. The cytotoxicity of a representative set of secondary and tertiary N-substituted 7-aminoheptanoic acid hydroxyamide-based inhibitors against HT-29, SH-SY5Y, and MCF-7 cancer cells correlated with their inhibition of HDAC1, 2, and 3 and was found to be similar to or better than that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Compounds in this series increased the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in a time-dependent manner. DMPK studies indicated that secondary amine 2 j is metabolically stable and has plasma and brain concentrations &gt;23- and &gt;1.6-fold higher than the IC50 value for class I HDACs, respectively. Overall, the secondary and tertiary N-substituted 7-aminoheptanoic acid hydroxyamide-based inhibitors exhibit excellent lead- and drug-like properties and therapeutic capacity for cancer applications. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "A recent metaanalysis shows that 0.7% of nanoparticles are delivered to solid tumors. This low delivery efficiency has major implications in the translation of cancer nanomedicines, as most of the nanomedicines are sequestered by nontumor cells. To improve the delivery efficiency, there is a need to investigate the quantitative contribution of each organ in blocking the transport of nanoparticles to solid tumors. Here, we hypothesize that the removal of the liver macrophages, cells that have been reported to take up the largest amount of circulating nanoparticles, would lead to a significant increase in the nanoparticle delivery efficiency to solid tumors. We were surprised to discover that the maximum achievable delivery efficiency was only 2%. In our analysis, there was a clear correlation between particle design, chemical composition, macrophage depletion, tumor pathophysiology, and tumor delivery efficiency. In many cases, we observed an 18-150 times greater delivery efficiency, but we were not able to achieve a delivery efficiency higher than 2%. The results suggest the need to look deeper at other organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor in mediating the delivery process. Systematically mapping the contribution of each organ quantitatively will allow us to pinpoint the cause of the low tumor delivery efficiency. This, in effect, enables the generation of a rational strategy to improve the delivery efficiency of nanoparticles to solid tumors either through the engineering of multifunctional nanosystems or through manipulation of biological barriers.",

    "Abstract": "As histone deacetylases (HDACs) play an important role in the treatment of cancer, their selective inhibition has been the subject of various studies. These continuous investigations have given rise to a large collection of pan- and selective HDAC inhibitors, containing diverse US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved representatives. In previous studies, a class of alkyne-based HDAC inhibitors was presented. We modified this scaffold in two previously neglected regions and compared their cytotoxicity and affinity toward HDAC1, HDAC6, and HDAC8. We were able to show that R-configured propargylamines contribute to increased selectivity for HDAC6. Docking studies on available HDAC crystal structures were carried out to rationalize the observed selectivity of the compounds. Substitution of the aromatic portion by a thiophene derivative results in high affinity and low cytotoxicity, indicating an improved drug tolerance. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "A quantum hybrid (QH) intelligent approach that blends the adaptive search capability of the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimisation (QPSO) method with the intuitionistic rationality of traditional fuzzy k-nearest neighbours (Fuzzy k-NN) algorithm (known simply as the Q-Fuzzy approach) is proposed for efficient feature selection and classification of cells in cervical smeared (CS) images. From an initial multitude of 17 features describing the geometry, colour, and texture of the CS images, the QPSO stage of our proposed technique is used to select the best subset features (i.e., global best particles) that represent a pruned down collection of seven features. Using a dataset of almost 1000 images, performance evaluation of our proposed Q-Fuzzy approach assesses the impact of our feature selection on classification accuracy by way of three experimental scenarios that are compared alongside two other approaches: the All-features (i.e., classification without prior feature selection) and another hybrid technique combining the standard PSO algorithm with the Fuzzy k-NN technique (P-Fuzzy approach). In the first and second scenarios, we further divided the assessment criteria in terms of classification accuracy based on the choice of best features and those in terms of the different categories of the cervical cells. In the third scenario, we introduced new QH hybrid techniques, i.e., QPSO combined with other supervised learning methods, and compared the classification accuracy alongside our proposed Q-Fuzzy approach. Furthermore, we employed statistical approaches to establish qualitative agreement with regards to the feature selection in the experimental scenarios 1 and 3. The synergy between the QPSO and Fuzzy k-NN in the proposed Q-Fuzzy approach improves classification accuracy as manifest in the reduction in number cell features, which is crucial for effective cervical cancer detection and diagnosis. © 2017 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "As a novel target for breast cancer, interferon inducers have found its role as anti-angiogenic agents with diethylaminoethyl dextran (DEAE-Dextran) being a molecule used for centuries as a transfection agent. Our results herein offer an explanation for the emergence of DEAE-Dextran as an anti-tumor agent for TNBC with in-depth mechanistic approach as an anti-angiogenic molecule. DEAE-Dextran has found to possess cytotoxic activity demonstrated during the various in vitro cytotoxicity assays; moreover, as an anti-oxidant, DEAE-Dextran has shown to possess excellent reactive oxygen species scavenging activity. The interferon inducing capacity of DEAE-Dextran was determined qualitatively as well as quantitatively specifically demonstrating overexpression of β-interferon. As a measure of anti-proliferative activity, DEAE-Dextran exhibited reduced ki67, p53, and PCNA levels. Also, overexpression of CK5/6 and p63 in DEAE-Dextran treated animals indicated improvement in breast cell morphology along with an improvement in cell-cell adhesion by virtue of upregulation of β-catenin and E-cadherin. Anti-angiogenic property of DEAE-Dextran was concluded by the downregulation of CD31, VEGF, and NOTCH1 both in vivo and in vitro. Further, apoptosis due to DEAE-Dextran, initially determined by downregulation of Bcl2, was confirmed with flow cytometry. Overall, results are defensive of DEAE-Dextran as an emerging anti-tumor agent with mechanisms pertaining to β-interferon induction with probable VEGF and NOTCH1 inhibition as well as apoptosis which still needs to be studied in further depth. © 2017 Bakrania, Variya and Patel.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression has been reported in up to 61% of high grade gliomas (HGG). The purpose of this study was to describe safety and efficacy of PD-1 inhibition in patients with refractory HGGs. Methods: This Institutional Review Board approved single center retrospective study included adult patients with pathologically confirmed HGG who received a PD-1 inhibitor from 9/2014-10/2016 outside of a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Results: Twenty five HGG patients received pembrolizumab as part of a compassionate use program. Median age was 50 years (range 30-72); 44% were men; 13 had glioblastoma (52%), 7 anaplastic astrocytoma (28%), 2 anaplastic oligodendroglioma (8%), 2 unspecified HGG (8%), and 1 gliosarcoma (4%). Median prior lines of treatments were 4 (range 1-9). Nineteen (76%) previously failed bevacizumab. Median KPS was 80 (range 50-100). Concurrent treatment included bevacizumab in 17 (68%) or bevacizumab and temozolomide in 2 (8%) patients. Median number of doses administered was 3 (range 1-14). Outcomes were assessed in 24 patients. PD-1 inhibitor related adverse events included LFT elevations, hypothyroidism, diarrhea, myalgias/arthralgias, and rash. Best radiographic response was partial response (n=2), stable disease (n=5), and progressive disease (n=17). Median progression free survival (PFS) was 1.4 months (range 0.2-9.4) and median overall survival (OS) was 4 months (range 0.5-13.8). Three-month PFS was 12% and 6-month OS was 28%. Conclusion: While response rates are low, a few patients had a prolonged PFS. Pembrolizumab was tolerated with few serious toxicities, even in patients receiving concomitant therapy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Immunotherapies, specifically those based on immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promising activity in multiple tumor types. Other than mifamurtide (MEPACT®) for osteosarcoma approved by European Medicines Agency, there are no approved immunotherapies for sarcomas. Methods: We analyzed medical records of patients with advanced sarcoma who were referred to Phase 1 clinic at MD Anderson and received an immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, or cytokine based therapies). Clinical parameters including demographics, clinical history, toxicity, and response were abstracted. Results: Among 50 patients enrolled in immunotherapy trials (Bone 10; Soft-tissue 40) we found 14 different subtypes of sarcomas. Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score was <2 (86%). Performance status (PS) was 0-1 in 48 patients (96%); median number of prior therapies was 3 (0-12). Immunotherapy consisted of checkpoint inhibitors (82%: PD1=7, PD-L1=11, CTLA4=22, other=1) of which 42% were combinations, as well as vaccines (14%), and cytokines (4%). Median overall survival (OS) was 13.4 months (11.2 months: not reached). Median progression free survival (PFS) was 2.4 months (95% CI=1.9-3.2 months). Best response was partial response (PR) in 2 patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and stable disease (SD) in 11 patients (3 GIST, 3 liposarcomas (2 DDLS, 1 WDLS), 2 ASPS, 2 leiomyo, 1 osteo). PFS was 34% (23%, at 50%) at 3 months, 16% (8%, 30%) at 6 months, and 6% (2%, 20%) at 1 year. Pseudo-progression followed by stable disease was observed in 2 patients (4%). Grade 3/4 adverse events included rash (10%), fever (6%), fatigue (6%), and nausea/vomiting (6%). Conclusion: Immunotherapies were well tolerated in advanced sarcoma patients enrolled in trials. All four ASPS patients had clinical benefit with checkpoint inhibitors and this was the only subtype experiencing partial response. Further evaluation of checkpoint inhibitors in ASPS is warranted. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cisplatin and other platinum-based drugs are well-known valid anticancer drugs. However, during chemotherapy, the presence of numerous side effects and the onset of frequent phenomena of resistance has pushed many research groups to devise new metal-based compounds holding improved anticancer properties and fewer undesired effects. Amongst the variety of synthesized compounds, significant antiproliferative effects have been obtained by employing organometallic compounds, particularly those based on silver and gold. With this in mind, we synthesized four compounds, two silver complexes and two gold complexes, with good inhibitory effects on the in vitro proliferation of breast and ovarian cancer-cell models. The antitumor activity of the most active compound, that is, AuL4, was found to be ninefold higher than that of cisplatin, and this compound induced dramatic morphological changes in HeLa cells. AuL4 induced PARP-1 cleavage, caspases 3/7 and 9 activation, mitochondria disruption, cytochrome c release in cancer-cell cytoplasm, and the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, AuL4 treatment caused cancer-cell death by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, whereas no cytotoxic effects were recorded upon treating non-tumor cell lines. The reported outcomes may be an important contribution to the expanding knowledge of medicinal bio-organometallic chemistry and enlarge the available anticancer toolbox, offering improved features, such as higher activity and/or selectivity, and opening the way to new discoveries and applications. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "The tumor-specific sensitive fluorescence sensing of cellular alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity on the basis of host-guest specific and pH sensitivity was conducted on coated surfaces and aqueous states. Cross-linked fluorescent nanoparticles (C-FNP) consisting of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)/boronic acid (BA) and fluorescent hyaluronic acid [FNP(HA)] were conjugated to fluorescent polydopamine [FNP(pDA)]. To determine the quenching effect of this system, hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP) to 4-nitrophenol (NP) was performed in the cavity of β-CD in the presence of ALP activated photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between NP and C-FNP. At an ALP level of 30-1000 U/L, NP caused off-emission of C-FNP because of their specific host-guest recognition. Fluorescence can be recovered under pH shock due to cleavage of the diol bond between β-CD and BA, resulting in release of NP from the fluorescent system. Sensitivity of the assays was assessed by confocal imaging not only in aqueous states, but also for the first time on coated surfaces in MDAMB-231 and MDCK cells. This novel system demonstrated high sensitivity to ALP through generation of good electron donor/acceptor pair during the PET process. Therefore, this fluorescence sensor system can be used to enhance ALP monitoring and cancer diagnosis on both coated surfaces and in aqueous states in clinical settings. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in peripheral blood and body mass index (BMI) can be independent prognostic factors in patients with melanoma. Methods: Clinical date of 140 patients with melanoma in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed the optimal cut-off value for PLR. The 140 patients were divided into high PLR group and low PLR group. According to \"Guidelines for prevention and control of overweight and obesity in Chinese adults\", the patients were divided into high BMI group and low BMI group. The relationship between PLR, BMI with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and disease free survival (DFS) were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method and Log rank test was used for univariate survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression model for multivariate analysis. Results: The optimal cut-off value of PLR determined by ROC curve was PLR=120.15, and BMI threshold was 24.Univariate survival analysis showed that PLR, BMI and clinical stage were the factors affecting the OS in patients (P<0.05). The median survival time (MST) was 21 months in the whole group and 17 months in the high PLR group, 34 months in the low PLR group, respectively; the MST in the high and low BMI group were 29 months and 13 months, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The effects of PLR and BMI on PFS and DFS were not statistically significant. Cox multivariate analysis showed that PLR, BMI and clinical stage were independent prognostic factors of OS (P<0.05). And BMI was the only independent protective factor for OS, the risk of death decreased by 0.611 times, with each unit increased for BMI. Clinical subgroup analysis showed that PLR also was risk factor to the prognosis of patients with stage II, III, and IV (P<0.05). Conclusions: PLR is an independent prognostic risk factor for patients with melanoma, and BMI is an independent protective factor. PLR and BMI are important factors in prognostic evaluation of melanoma. Copyright © 2017 by the Chinese Medical Association.",

    "Abstract": "Background: We have previously shown that radiotherapy (RT) augments natural killer (NK) functions in pre-clinical models of human and mouse cancers, including sarcomas. Since dogs are an excellent outbred model for immunotherapy studies, we sought to assess RT plus local autologous NK transfer in canine sarcomas. Methods: Dog NK cells (CD5dim, NKp46+) were isolated from PBMCs and expanded with irradiated K562-C9-mIL21 feeder cells and 100 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2. NK homing and cytotoxicity ± RT were evaluated using canine osteosarcoma tumor lines and dog patient-derived xenografts (PDX). In a first-in-dog clinical trial for spontaneous osteosarcoma, we evaluated RT and intra-tumoral autologous NK transfer. Results: After 14 days, mean NK expansion and yield were 19.0-fold (±8.6) and 258.9(±76.1) ×106 cells, respectively. Post-RT, NK cytotoxicity increased in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro reaching ~ 80% at effector:target ratios of ≥10:1 (P&lt;0.001). In dog PDX models, allogeneic NK cells were cytotoxic in ex vivo killing assays and produced significant PDX tumor growth delay (P&lt;0.01) in vivo. After focal RT and intravenous NK transfer, we also observed significantly increased NK homing to tumors in vivo. Of 10 dogs with spontaneous osteosarcoma treated with focal RT and autologous NK transfer, 5 remain metastasis-free at the 6-month primary endpoint with resolution of suspicious pulmonary nodules in one patient. We also observed increased activation of circulating NK cells after treatment and persistence of labelled NK cells in vivo. Conclusions: NK cell homing and cytotoxicity are increased following RT in canine models of sarcoma. Results from a first-in-dog clinical trial are promising, including possible abscopal effects. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Sorafenib is a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to prolong overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Predicting this drug's survival benefits is challenging because clinical responses are rarely measurable during treatment. In this study, we hypothesized that serum cytokines levels could predict the survival of advanced HCC patients, as sorafenib targets signaling pathways activated in the tumor stromal microenvironment and potentially affects serum cytokine profiles. Methods: Of 143 patients with advanced-stage HCC, 104 who were recruited between 2003 and 2007 received hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) that mainly targets tumor epithelial cells at S-phase (cohort 1); additionally, 39 recruited between 2010 and 2012 received sorafenib, which primarily targets the stromal vascular endothelial cells. Serum samples were collected and aliquoted prior to the treatment. Serum EGF, bFGF, HGF, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, MIG, PDGF-BB, SCF, SDF1, TGF-β, TGF-α, TNF-α, and VEGF-A were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were used to assess tumor responses. Results: The median survival time of HCC patients in cohorts 1 (HAIC-treated) and 2 (sorafenib-treated) were 12.0 and 12.4 months, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant survival differences between the 2 groups. Patients who survived more than 2 years after sorafenib treatment exhibited higher serum levels of IL-10, IL-12, TNF-a, IL-8, SDF-1, EGF, PDGF-BB, SCF, and TGF-α. Furthermore, cohort 2 patients with higher serum IL-5 (>12 pg/mL), IL-8 (>10 pg/mL), PDGF-BB (>300 pg/mL), and VEGF-A (>50 pg/mL) levels achieved longer survival; cohort 1 patients did not. Hierarchical cluster analysis of 6 cytokines robustly enriched for comparison analysis between cohorts 1 and 2 (IL-5, IL-8, TGF-α, PDGF-BB, CXCL9, and VEGF-A) revealed that elevation of these cytokines correlated with better survival when treated with sorafenib but not with HAIC. Conclusions: Patients who exhibited survival benefits owing to sorafenib treatment tended to present higher serum cytokines levels, potentially reflecting the activation of stromal signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Our study thus introduces novel biomarkers that may identify advanced HCC patients who may experience survival benefits with sorafenib treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The development of high-gradient accelerating structures for low-β particles is the key for compact hadron linear accelerators. A particular example of such a machine is a hadron therapy linac, which is a promising alternative to cyclic machines, traditionally used for cancer treatment. Currently, the practical utilization of linear accelerators in radiation therapy is limited by the requirement to be under 50 m in length. A usable device for cancer therapy should produce 200-250 MeV protons and/or 400-450 MeV/u carbon ions, which sets the requirement of having 35 MV/m average \"real-estate gradient\" or gradient per unit of actual accelerator length, including different accelerating sections, focusing elements and beam transport lines, and at least 50 MV/m accelerating gradients in the high-energy section of the linac. Such high accelerating gradients for ion linacs have recently become feasible for operations at S-band frequencies. However, the reasonable application of traditional S-band structures is practically limited to β=v/c>0.4. However, the simulations show that for lower phase velocities, these structures have either high surface fields (>200 MV/m) or low shunt impedances (<35 MΩ/m). At the same time, a significant (∼10%) reduction in the linac length can be achieved by using the 50 MV/m structures starting from β∼0.3. To address this issue, we have designed a novel radio frequency structure where the beam is synchronous with the higher spatial harmonic of the electromagnetic field. In this paper, we discuss the principles of this approach, the related beam dynamics and especially the electromagnetic and thermomechanical designs of this novel structure. Besides the application to ion therapy, the technology described in this paper can be applied to future high gradient normal conducting ion linacs and high energy physics machines, such as a compact hadron collider. This approach preserves linac compactness in settings with limited space availability. © 2017 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Sun exposure is known to yield beneficial health outcomes, including synthesis of adequate levels of vitamin D and beneficial modulation of blood pressure, and it is a valuable factor in mental health care. However, the increasing incidence of sun/UV exposure-related illness, such as skin cancer, is seriously concerning public health authorities as well as the scientific community. Consequently, moderate sun/UV exposure is strongly recommended. A wearable nanoplasmonic patch whose original color changes upon sun exposure due to its UV-responsive capabilities that are visually detectable has been engineered. The main scaffold of this patch is made of nanopaper, which is a flexible, lightweight, optically transparent and biocompatible material. Moreover, its UV-responsive agent is based on silver nanoparticles (AgNP), whose nanoplasmonic properties and safe use in bioapplications are widely covered in the literature. As UV light can modulate the size of AgNP significantly, the nanoplasmonic properties of the AgNP-decorated nanopaper are also modulated leading to a change in color, which is readily observable upon sun exposure. This facilitates that the users can be alerted to moderate sun exposure and may prevent skin damage. Given the transparent nanoplasmonic nature of the resulting device, after 15 min of artificial sunlight exposure, the change in color of the patch was proven more observable in skins with the highest and moderate risk of developing skin cancer (skin types I, II, III, and IV) than in skin types V and VI - which are reported to tolerate relatively high levels of sun exposure safely. This low-cost wearable device is amenable to facilitating healthcare in low-resource settings using biomaterials and nanoplasmonics. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate myriad cellular processes by catalyzing the hydrolysis of acetyl-L-lysine residues in histone and nonhistone proteins. The Zn2+-dependent class IIb enzyme HDAC6 regulates microtubule function by deacetylating α-tubulin, which suppresses microtubule dynamics and leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Accordingly, HDAC6 is a target for the development of selective inhibitors that might be useful in new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and other disorders. Here, we present high-resolution structures of catalytic domain 2 from Danio rerio HDAC6 (henceforth simply \"HDAC6\") complexed with compounds that selectively inhibit HDAC6 while maintaining nanomolar inhibitory potency: N-hydroxy- 4-[(N(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-phenylacetamido)methyl)-benzamide)] (HPB), ACY-1215 (Ricolinostat), and ACY-1083. These structures reveal that an unusual monodentate Zn2+ coordination mode is exploited by sterically bulky HDAC6-selective phenylhydroxamate inhibitors. We additionally report the ultrahigh-resolution structure of the HDAC6-trichostatin A complex, which reveals two Zn2+-binding conformers for the inhibitor: a major conformer (70%) with canonical bidentate hydroxamate-Zn2+ coordination geometry and a minor conformer (30%) with monodentate hydroxamate-Zn2+ coordination geometry, reflecting a free energy difference of only 0.5 kcal/mol. The minor conformer is not visible in lower resolution structure determinations. Structural comparisons of HDAC6-inhibitor complexes with class I HDACs suggest active site features that contribute to the isozyme selectivity observed in biochemical assays.",

    "Abstract": "Background: A distended, mucous-filled appendix is known as an appendiceal mucocele. They are a rare form of an appendiceal mass and develop from both benign and malignant processes. Mucoceles can develop secondarily to an obstruction, such as from a fecalith, scarring or, rarely, endometriosis. Only 12 cases of non-neoplastic appendiceal mucoceles caused by endometriosis have been previously described. The association between neoplastic appendiceal mucoceles in the presence of endometriosis is described for the first time in this report. Case presentation: A 57-year-old woman presented with a chief complaint of worsening abdominal pain over the past 3 months. Imaging studies revealed an appendiceal mass. Laparoscopic evaluation confirmed an appendiceal mucocele, and the patient underwent complete appendectomy. No evidence of mucinous or endometrial deposits were present within the abdominal cavity. Pathological diagnosis revealed low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) with evidence of endometriosis within the muscularis propria of the appendix. The patient recovered without complications and her abdominal pain completely resolved. Conclusions: Endometriosis of the appendix is a rare manifestation and is most often identified as an incidental finding. Endometriosis leading to an obstructive mucocele of the appendix is an exceedingly rare finding, having only been described 12 times in the medical literature. LAMN in the presence of endometriosis of the appendix is described for the first time in this report. The association between appendiceal neoplasms in the presence of endometriosis requires further research in order to optimize operative treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Immune related adverse events (irAEs) are associated with immunotherapy for cancer and while results suggest improvement in tumor control and overall survival in those experiencing irAEs, the long-term impact is debated. We evaluated irAE reports related to high dose interleukin-2 therapy (IL-2) documented in the PROCLAIMSM registry data base from 2008 to 2016 (NCT01415167, August 9, 2011). Methods: Reports on 1535 patients, including 623 with metastatic melanoma (mM) and 919 with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) (7 patients had both diseases), were queried for irAEs. The timing of the event was categorized as occurring before, during or after IL-2 or related to any checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). mM patients and mRCC patients were analyzed separately. Tumor control [complete + partial response + stable disease (CR+PR+SD) was compared between those experiencing no irAE versus those with the development of irAEs. Survival was analyzed by tumor type related to timing of irAE and IL-2, and in those with or without exposure to CPI. Results: Median follow-up was 3.5+ years (range 1-8+ years), 152 irAEs were reported in 130 patients (8.4% of all PROCLAIMSM patients): 99 (16%) in mM and 53 (5.8%) in mRCC patients. 31 irAEs occurred prior to IL-2, 24 during IL-2, and 97 after IL-2 therapy. 74 irAEs were attributed to IL-2 only (during/ after IL-2). Of the 97 post IL-2 irAEs, 24 were attributed to CPI, and 15 could not be distinguished as caused by IL-2 or CPI. Tumor control was 71% for those experiencing irAE, and 56% for those with no irAE (p=0.0008). Overall survival was significantly greater for those experiencing irAEs during/ after IL-2 therapy, compared to those with no irAE or irAE before IL-2 therapy, in mM patients, median 48 months vs 18 months (p&lt;0.0001), and in mRCC patients, median 60 months vs 40 months (p=0.0302), independent of CPI-related irAEs. IL-2-related irAEs were primarily vitiligo and thyroid dysfunction (70% of IL-2 related irAEs), with limited further impact. Conclusions: irAEs following IL-2 therapy are associated with improved tumor control and overall survival. IrAEs resulting from IL-2 and from CPIs are qualitatively different, and likely reflect different mechanisms of action of immune activation and response. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Given the limited efficacy of clinical approaches that rely on ex vivo generated dendritic cells (DCs), it is imperative to design strategies that harness specialized DC subsets in situ. This requires delineating the expression of surface markers by DC subsets among individuals and tissues. Here, we performed a multiparametric phenotypic characterization and unbiased analysis of human DC subsets in blood, tonsil, spleen, and skin. We uncovered previously unreported phenotypic heterogeneity of human cDC2s among individuals, including variable expression of functional receptors such as CD172a. We found marked differences in DC subsets localized in blood and lymphoid tissues versus skin, and a striking absence of the newly discovered Axl+ DCs in the skin. Finally, we evaluated the capacity of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies to deliver vaccine components to skin DC subsets. These results offer a promising path for developing DC subset-specific immunotherapies that cannot be provided by transcriptomic analysis alone. Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent initiators of immune responses; however, human DC subsets have yet to be successfully harnessed for immunotherapies. By combining CyTOF and unbiased analysis, Alcántara-Hernández et al. profile the heterogeneity of human DC subsets among individuals and tissues, providing comprehensive insights for the development of DC-based therapeutics. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for operators. This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair markers in operators perfoming EVAR. Methods: Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in operators during the peri-operative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same operators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating operators' blood in vitro. Results: γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in operators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (P<0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (P<0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in operators after 24 hours (P<0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when operators' blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (P<0.0001). Conclusions: This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage response in operators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding. Defining the relationship between this response and cancer risk may better inform safe levels of chronic low-dose radiation exposure.",

    "Abstract": "Published research results are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set in the area of decision support systems in mammography; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. We seek to resolve this substantial challenge by releasing an updated and standardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography. Our data set, the CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM), includes decompressed images, data selection and curation by trained mammographers, updated mass segmentation and bounding boxes, and pathologic diagnosis for training data, formatted similarly to modern computer vision data sets. The data set contains 753 calcification cases and 891 mass cases, providing a data-set size capable of analyzing decision support systems in mammography. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "High mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) protein is composed of three AT-hook domains. HMGA2 expresses at high levels in both embryonic stem cells and cancer cells, where it interacts with and stabilizes replication forks (RFs), resulting in elevated cell proliferation rates. In this study, we demonstrated that HMGA2 knockdown reduces cell proliferation. To understand the features required for interaction between HMGA2 and RFs, we studied the solution structure of HMGA2, free and in complex with RFs, using an integrated host of biophysical techniques. Circular dichroism and NMR experiments confirmed the disordered state of unbound HMGA2. Dynamic light scattering and sedimentation velocity experiments demonstrated that HMGA2 and RF are monodisperse in solution, and form an equimolar complex. Small-angle x-ray scattering studies revealed that HMGA2 binds in a side-by-side orientation to RF where 3 AT-hooks act as a clamp to wrap around a distorted RF. Thus, our data provide insights into how HMGA2 interacts with stalled RFs and the function of the process. © 2017 Biophysical Society",

    "Abstract": "Cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.var. capitata), an important crop of the Brassicaceae family, is a highly valued source of anti-cancer compounds, vitamin C and high-quality protein. Glossiness of the leaf surface is an important character that has an important influence on the quality of commercial products. In this study, two heart-shaped glossy cabbage mutants were examined to determine their characteristics and potential practical applications. Firstly, mutant-type (MT) plants showed a shiny and attractive appearance, and the total wax load in MT leaves was significantly less than that of wild-type (WT) leaves, when assessed by scanning electron micrographs. Then, the results of χ2 tests on the separated proportion proved that the glossy wax-less trait is controlled by a single recessive gene. Unexpectedly, the sulforaphane content, which has been identified as a naturally potent anticarcinogen, showed an increasing trend in MT plants than the corresponding WT plants. Lastly, our work also showed that some genes that are involved in wax biosynthesis and export pathways are down-regulated in MT leaves, which could cause the glossy phenotype of MT plants. These analyses will shed light on the benefits of incorporating the two mutants and other glossy mutants into future breeding programs to develop varieties with morphological markers linked to desirable traits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is well known as the pathway for passive diffusion of anionic hydrophilic mitochondrial metabolites across the outer membrane, but a more complex functionality of the three isoforms of VDAC has emerged, as addressed in the Frontiers in Oncology Research Topic on \"Uncovering the Function of the Mitochondrial Protein VDAC in Health and Disease: from Structure-Function to Novel Therapeutic Strategies.\" VDAC as the single most abundant protein in mitochondrial outer membranes is typically involved in isoform-specific interactions of the mitochondrion with its surroundings as, for example, during mitochondria-dependent pathways of cell death. VDAC closure can also act as an adjustable limiter (governator) of global mitochondrial metabolism, as during hepatic ethanol metabolism to promote selective oxidation of membrane-permeant acetaldehyde. In cancer cells, high free tubulin inhibits VDAC1 and VDAC2, contributing to suppression of mitochondrial function in the Warburg phenomenon. Erastin, the canonical inducer of ferroptosis, opens VDAC in the presence of tubulin and hyperpolarizes mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. Our understanding of VDAC function continues to evolve. © 2017 Lemasters.",

    "Abstract": "In this study we constructed spherical photo-responsive microcapsules composed of three photo-switchable DNA strands. These strands first formed a three-way junction (TWJ) motif that further self-assembled to form microspheres through hybridization of the sticky-end regions of each branch. To serve as the photo-switch, multiple unmodified azobenzene (Azo) or 2,6-dimethyl-4-(methylthio)azobenzene (SDM-Azo) were introduced into the sticky-end regions via a d-threoninol linker. The DNA capsule structure deformed upon trans-to-cis isomerization of Azo or SDM-Azo induced by specific light irradiation. In addition, photo-triggered release of encapsulated small molecules from the DNA microcapsule was successfully achieved. Moreover, we demonstrated that photo-triggered release of doxorubicin caused cytotoxicity to cultured cells. This biocompatible photo-responsive microcapsule has potential application as a photo-controlled drug-release system. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) is an antimitotic treatment modality that interferes with glioblastoma cell division and organelle assembly by delivering low-intensity alternating electric fields to the tumor. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether TTFields improves progression-free and overall survival of patients with glioblastoma, a fatal disease that commonly recurs at the initial tumor site or in the central nervous system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized, open-label trial, 695 patients with glioblastoma whose tumor was resected or biopsied and had completed concomitant radiochemotherapy (median time from diagnosis to randomization, 3.8 months) were enrolled at 83 centers (July 2009-2014) and followed up through December 2016. A preliminary report from this trial was published in 2015; this report describes the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 2:1 to TTFields plus maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy (n = 466) or temozolomide alone (n = 229). The TTFields, consisting of low-intensity, 200 kHz frequency, alternating electric fields, was delivered ( 18 hours/d) via 4 transducer arrays on the shaved scalp and connected to a portable device. Temozolomide was administered to both groups (150-200 mg/m2) for 5 days per 28-day cycle (6-12 cycles). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Progression-free survival (tested at ? = .046). The secondary end point was overall survival (tested hierarchically at ? = .048). Analyses were performed for the intent-to-treat population. Adverse events were compared by group. RESULTS Of the 695 randomized patients (median age, 56 years; IQR, 48-63; 473 men [68%]), 637 (92%) completed the trial. Median progression-free survival from randomization was 6.7 months in the TTFields-temozolomide group and 4.0 months in the temozolomide-alone group (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.76; P &lt; .001). Median overall survival was 20.9 months in the TTFields-temozolomide group vs 16.0 months in the temozolomide-alone group (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53-0.76; P &lt; .001). Systemic adverse event frequency was 48% in the TTFields-temozolomide group and 44% in the temozolomide-alone group. Mild to moderate skin toxicity underneath the transducer arrays occurred in 52% of patients who received TTFields-temozolomide vs no patients who received temozolomide alone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the final analysis of this randomized clinical trial of patients with glioblastoma who had received standard radiochemotherapy, the addition of TTFields to maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy vs maintenance temozolomide alone, resulted in statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival.

    "Abstract": "Targeted delivery of intracellular stimuli-activatable photosensitizers (PSs) into tumor cells to achieve selective imaging and on-demand photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors has provided a vital opportunity for precise cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this paper, we report a tumor targeting and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-activatable nanophotosensitizer Apt-HyNP/BHQ2 by modifying hybrid micellar nanoparticles with both nucleolin-targeting aptamer AS1411 and quencher BHQ2-labeled ATP-binding aptamer BHQ2-ATP-apt. We demonstrated that both of the fluorescence emissions at 555 and 627 nm were quenched by BHQ2 in Apt-HyNP/BHQ2, resulting in low PDT capacity. After selective entry into tumor cells through nucleolin-mediated endocytosis, the high concentration of intracellular ATP could bind to BHQ2-ATP-apt and trigger Apt-HyNP/BHQ2 dissociation, leading to turning \"on\" both fluorescence and PDT. The \"off-on\" fluorescence emissions at both 555 and 627 nm were successfully applied for dual color fluorescence imaging of endogenous ATP levels and real-time monitoring of intracellular activation of Apt-HyNP/BHQ2 in tumor cells. Moreover, imaging-guided precise PDT of tumors in living mice was also demonstrated, allowing for selective ablation of tumors without obvious side effects. This study highlights the potential of using a combination of tumor-targeting and ATP-binding aptamers to design ATP-activatable PSs for both fluorescence imaging and imaging-guided PDT of tumors in vivo. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Feature selection and prediction are the most important tasks for big data mining. The common strategies for feature selection in big data mining are L 1, SCAD and MC+. However, none of the existing algorithms optimizes L 0, which penalizes the number of nonzero features directly. Results: In this paper, we develop a novel sparse generalized linear model (GLM) with L 0 approximation for feature selection and prediction with big omics data. The proposed approach approximate the L 0 optimization directly. Even though the original L 0 problem is non-convex, the problem is approximated by sequential convex optimizations with the proposed algorithm. The proposed method is easy to implement with only several lines of code. Novel adaptive ridge algorithms (L 0ADRIDGE) for L 0 penalized GLM with ultra high dimensional big data are developed. The proposed approach outperforms the other cutting edge regularization methods including SCAD and MC+ in simulations. When it is applied to integrated analysis of mRNA, microRNA, and methylation data from TCGA ovarian cancer, multilevel gene signatures associated with suboptimal debulking are identified simultaneously. The biological significance and potential clinical importance of those genes are further explored. Conclusions: The developed Software L 0ADRIDGE in MATLAB is available at https://github.com/liuzqx/L0adridge. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The proneural (PN) and mesenchymal (MES) subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are robust and generally consistent with classification schemes. GBMs in the MES subclass are predominantly primary tumors that, compared to PN tumors, exhibit a worse prognosis; thus, understanding the mechanism of MES differentiation may be of great benefit for the treatment of GBM. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling is critically important in GBM, and activation of NF-κB could induce MES transdifferentiation in GBM, which warrants additional research. NUDT21 is a newly discovered tumor-associated gene according to our current research. The exact roles of NUDT21 in cancer incidence have not been elucidated. Here, we report that NUDT21 expression was upregulated in human glioma tissues and that NUDT21 promoted glioma cell proliferation, likely through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis, western blotting, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that NF-κB inhibitor zeta (NFKBIZ) was a downstream target affected by NUDT21 and that the MES identity genes in glioblastoma cells, CHI3L1 and FN1, were also differentially regulated. Our results suggest that NUDT21 is an upstream regulator of the NF-κB pathway and a potential molecular target for the MES subtype of GBM. © 2017 Lou, Lan, Gao, Ma, Yang, Yuan, Zhang, Zhu, Pan, Leng, Song and Zhang.",

    "Abstract": "DNA methylation at promoters is an important determinant of gene expression. Earlier studies suggested that the insulin gene promoter is uniquely unmethylated in insulin-expressing pancreatic β-cells, providing a classic example of this paradigm. Here we show that islet cells expressing insulin, glucagon, or somatostatin share a lack of methylation at the promoters of the insulin and glucagon genes. This is achieved by rapid demethylation of the insulin and glucagon gene promoters during differentiation of Neurogenin3+ embryonic endocrine progenitors, regardless of the specific endocrine cell-type chosen. Similar methylation dynamics were observed in transgenic mice containing a human insulin promoter fragment, pointing to the responsible cis element. Whole-methylome comparison of human α- and β-cells revealed generality of the findings: genes active in one cell type and silent in the other tend to share demethylated promoters, while methylation differences between α- and β-cells are concentrated in enhancers. These findings suggest an epigenetic basis for the observed plastic identity of islet cell types, and have implications for β-cell reprogramming in diabetes and diagnosis of β-cell death using methylation patterns of circulating DNA.",

    "Abstract": "Very large DNA molecules enable comprehensive analysis of complex genomes, such as human, cancer, and plants because they span across sequence repeats and complex somatic events. When physically manipulated, or analyzed as single molecules, long polyelectrolytes are problematic because of mechanical considerations that include shear-mediated breakage, dealing with the massive size of these coils, or the length of stretched DNAs using common experimental techniques and fluidic devices. Accordingly, we harness analyte \"issues\" as exploitable advantages by our invention and characterization of the \"molecular gate,\" which controls and synchronizes formation of stretched DNA molecules as DNA dumbbells within nanoslit geometries. Molecular gate geometries comprise micro- and nanoscale features designed to synergize very low ionic strength conditions in ways we show effectively create an \"electrostatic bottle.\" This effect greatly enhances molecular confinement within large slit geometries and supports facile, synchronized electrokinetic loading of nanoslits, even without dumbbell formation. Device geometries were considered at the molecular and continuum scales through computer simulations, which also guided our efforts to optimize design and functionalities. In addition, we show that the molecular gate may govern DNA separations because DNA molecules can be electrokinetically triggered, by varying applied voltage, to enter slits in a size-dependent manner. Lastly, mapping the Mesoplasma florum genome, via synchronized dumbbell formation, validates our nascent approach as a viable starting point for advanced development that will build an integrated system capable of large-scale genome analysis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study is to explore the clinical characteristics, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment outcomes in pediatric patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis. Methods: Retrospective patient chart review was performed between March 2009 to March 2015. Cases were included if they met the selection criteria for non-diabetic ketoacidosis, which were: 1) Age ≤ 18 years; 2) urine ketone positive ++ or &gt;8.0 mmol/L; 3) blood ketone &gt;3.1 mmol/L; 4) acidosis (pH &lt; 7.3) and/or HCO3 &lt; 15 mmol/L; 5) random blood glucose level &lt; 11.1 mmol/L. Patients who met the criteria 1, 4, 5, plus either 2 or 3, were defined as non-diabetic ketoacidosis and were included in the report. Results: Five patients with 7 episodes of non-diabetic ketoacidosis were identified. They all presented with dehydration, poor appetite, and Kussmaul breathing. Patients treated with insulin plus glucose supplementation had a quicker recovery from acidosis, in comparison to those treated with bicarbonate infusion and continuous renal replacement therapy. Two patients treated with bicarbonate infusion developed transient coma and seizures during the treatment. Conclusion: Despite normal or low blood glucose levels, patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis should receive insulin administration with glucose supplementation to correct ketoacidosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection, arises from the coexistence of over 200 genetically distinct types. Accurately predicting the impact of vaccines that target multiple types requires understanding the factors that determine HPV diversity. The diversity of many pathogens is driven by type-specific or \"homologous\" immunity, which promotes the spread of variants to which hosts have little immunity. To test for homologous immunity and to identify mechanisms determining HPV transmission, we fitted nonlinear mechanistic models to longitudinal data on genital infections in unvaccinated men. Our results provide no evidence for homologous immunity, instead showing that infection with one HPV type strongly increases the risk of infection with that type for years afterward. For HPV16, the type responsible for most HPV-related cancers, an initial infection increases the 1-year probability of reinfection by 20-fold, and the probability of reinfection remains 14-fold higher 2 years later. This increased risk occurs in both sexually active and celibate men, suggesting that it arises from autoinoculation, episodic reactivation of latent virus, or both. Overall, our results suggest that high HPV prevalence and diversity can be explained by a combination of a lack of homologous immunity, frequent reinfections, weak competition between types, and variation in type fitness between host subpopulations. Because of the high risk of reinfection, vaccinating boys who have not yet been exposed may be crucial to reduce prevalence, but our results suggest that there may also be large benefits to vaccinating previously infected individuals.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gliomas are commonly malignant tumors that arise in the human central nervous system and have a low overall five-year survival rate. Previous studies reported that several members of Rab GTPase family are involved in the development of glioma, and abnormal expression of Rab small GTPases is known to cause aberrant tumor cell behavior. In this study, we characterized the roles of Rab21 (Rab GTPase 21), a member of Rab GTPase family, in glioma cells. Methods: The study involved downregulation of Rab21 in two glioma cell lines (T98G and U87) through transfection with specific-siRNA. Experiments using the MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay, real-time PCR and western blot were performed to establish the expression levels of related genes. Results: The results show that downregulation of Rab21 can significantly inhibit cell growth and remarkably induce cell apoptosis in T98G and U87 cell lines. Silencing Rab21 resulted in significantly increased expression of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase7, Bim and Bax) in glioma cells. Conclusions: We inferred that Rab21 silencing can induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in human glioma cells, indicating that Rab21 might act as an oncogene and serve as a novel target for glioma therapy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Neosporosis caused by the apicomplexan parasite Neospora caninum is an economically important disease that induces abortion in dairy and beef cattle. There are no vaccines or drugs available on the market for control or treatment of the disease in bovines. The peroxide artemisinin and its derivatives used clinically for treatment of malaria are active against N. caninum and other apicomplexan parasites. We have now evaluated the activities of the readily accessible and chemically robust 11-azaartemisinin 5 and selected N-sulfonyl derivatives prepared as described in the accompanying paper against N. caninum tachyzoites grown in infected human foreskin fibroblasts. Azaartemisinin elicited an IC50 value of 150 nm, and the 2′,5′-dichloro-3′-thienylsulfonyl-11-azaartemisinin 17 was found to be the most active, with an IC50 value of 40 nm. Comparison with normal human fetal lung fibroblasts HFLF WI-38 revealed relatively benign cytotoxicity. The compounds were also screened in vitro against TK-10 (renal), UACC-62 (melanoma) and MCF-7 (breast) cancer cell lines; overall, in line with activities against HFLF cells, most compounds in the series were found to be inactive. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Aims: Although high expression of ZBTB7A is positively relative to metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients, the association between its low expression and metastasis of NPC remains unclear. The present study aimed to definitely identify the association. Methods: The level of ZBTB7A was effectively knocked down by stable transfection of short hair RNA plasmid in NPC cell lines CNE2 and 5-8F (shRNA-CNE2 and shRNA-5-8F), compared with the cells that stably transfected empty plasmid (NC-CNE2 and NC-5-8F). The levels of ZBTB7A were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot in the cell lines. MTT assay, colorimetric focus-formation assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, transwell assays, and xenograft model were performed to analyze cell vitality, proliferation, cell cycle, migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity. Results: The levels of ZBTB7A were effectively reduced in shRNA-CNE2 and shRNA-5-8F. Their carcinogenicity was stronger separately than the abilities of NC-CNE2 and NC-5-8F. NC-CNE2 and shRNA-CNE2 were selected to establish the xenograft model because of their stronger tumorigenicity than NC-6-10B and shRNA-5-8F. The assay showed that shRNA-CNE2 had stronger tumorigenicity than NC-CNE2. Conclusions: The results demonstrated the reverse association between the expression of ZBTB7A and the tumorigenicity of NPC. We postulate that some oncogenic pathways, which are suppressed by ZBTB7A, will vicariously promote the proliferation and progression of NPC when ZBTB7A is decreased. © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Interpretation of positive genotoxicity findings using the current in vitro testing battery is a major challenge to industry and regulatory agencies. These tests, especially mammalian cell assays, have high sensitivity but suffer from low specificity, leading to high rates of irrelevant positive findings (i.e., positive results in vitro that are not relevant to human cancer hazard). We developed an in vitro transcriptomic biomarker-based approach that provides biological relevance to positive genotoxicity assay data, particularly for in vitro chromosome damage assays, and propose its application for assessing the relevance of the in vitro positive results to carcinogenic hazard. The transcriptomic biomarker TGx-DDI (previously known as TGx-28.65) readily distinguishes DNA damage-inducing (DDI) agents from non-DDI agents. In this study, we demonstrated the ability of the biomarker to classify 45 test agents across a broad set of chemical classes as DDI or non-DDI. Furthermore, we assessed the biomarker's utility in derisking known irrelevant positive agents and evaluated its performance across analytical platforms. We correctly classified 90% (9 of 10) of chemicals with irrelevant positive findings in in vitro chromosome damage assays as negative. We developed a standardized experimental and analytical protocol for our transcriptomics biomarker, as well as an enhanced application of TGx-DDI for high-throughput cell-based genotoxicity testing using nCounter technology. This biomarker can be integrated in genetic hazard assessment as a follow-up to positive chromosome damage findings. In addition, we propose how it might be used in chemical screening and assessment. This approach offers an opportunity to significantly improve risk assessment and reduce cost.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Over 40% of women undergoing breast screening have mammographically dense breasts. Elevated mammographic breast density (MBD) is an established breast cancer risk factor and is known to mask tumors within the dense tissue. However, the association of MBD with high risk benign breast disease (BBD) is unknown. Method: We analyzed data for 3400 women diagnosed with pathologically confirmed BBD in the Mayo Clinic BBD cohort from 1985-2001, with a clinical MBD measure (either parenchymal pattern (PP) or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) density) and expert pathology review. Risk factor information was collected from medical records and questionnaires. MBD was dichotomized as dense (PP classification P2 or DY, or BI-RADS classification c or d) or non-dense (PP classification N1 or P1, or BI-RADS classification a or b). Associations of clinical and histologic characteristics with MBD were examined using logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Of 3400 women in the study, 2163 (64%) had dense breasts. Adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI), there were positive associations of dense breasts with use of hormone therapy (HT), lack of lobular involution, presence of atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), histologic fibrosis, columnar cell hyperplasia/flat epithelia atypia (CCH/FEA), sclerosing adenosis (SA), cyst, usual ductal hyperplasia, and calcifications. In fully adjusted multivariate models, HT (1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), ALH (1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2), lack of lobular involution (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1, compared to complete involution), fibrosis (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.9-2.6) and CCH/FEA (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) remained significantly associated with high MBD. Conclusion: Our findings support an association between high risk BBD and high MBD, suggesting that risks associated with the latter may act early in breast carcinogenesis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Human in vitro generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages are used clinically, e.g., to induce immunity against cancer. However, their physiological counterparts, ontogeny, transcriptional regulation, and heterogeneity remains largely unknown, hampering their clinical use. High-dimensional techniques were used to elucidate transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional differences between human in vivo and in vitro generated mononuclear phagocytes to facilitate their full potential in the clinic. We demonstrate that monocytes differentiated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) resembled in vivo inflammatory macrophages, while moDCs resembled in vivo inflammatory DCs. Moreover, differentiated monocytes presented with profound transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional differences. Monocytes integrated GM-CSF and IL-4 stimulation combinatorically and temporally, resulting in a mode- and time-dependent differentiation relying on NCOR2. Finally, moDCs are phenotypically heterogeneous and therefore necessitate the use of high-dimensional phenotyping to open new possibilities for better clinical tailoring of these cellular therapies. Monocyte-derived cellular derivatives are used clinically and are a crucial tool in basic research. Sander and colleagues now show that they transcriptionally relate to in vivo inflammatory monocytes, that they integrate differentiation cues time dependently, and that in vitro differentiated monocytes are phenotypically heterogeneous. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: It has been widely accepted that hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to explore the function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by HBx. Methods: The association between HBx and EMT markers was detected using immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues. The effect of HBx on HCC EMT was assessed through morphological analysis, transwell assay, metastatic in vivo study and detection of EMT markers. LncRNA microarray was used to screen the differently expressed lncRNAs. Small interfering RNA and Western blot were used to analyse the function and mechanism of the locked lncRNA. Results: HBx was negatively correlated with the epithelial marker E-cadherin but positively correlated with the mesenchymal marker vimentin in HCC tissues. HBx induced the mesenchymal phenotype and improved the metastatic ability of HCC cells. Meanwhile, HBx down-regulated E-cadherin, whereas it up-regulated vimentin. In HCC cells, HBx altered the expression of 2002 lncRNAs by more than 2-fold. One of them was ZEB2-AS1. Inhibition of ZEB2-AS1 can compensate for the EMT phenotype and reverse the expression of EMT markers regulated by HBx. Additionally, HBx affected the Wnt signalling pathway. Conclusions: HBx promotes HCC cell metastasis by inducing EMT, which is at least partly mediated by lncRNAs. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), an enzyme involved in purine and polyamine metabolism and in the methionine salvage pathway, is considered as a potential drug target against cancer and trypanosomiasis. In fact, Trypanosoma and Leishmania parasites lack de novo purine pathways and rely on purine salvage pathways to meet their requirements. Herein, we propose the first comprehensive bioinformatic and structural characterization of the putative Leishmania infantum MTAP (LiMTAP), using a comparative computational approach. Results: Sequence analysis showed that LiMTAP shared higher identity rates with the Trypanosoma brucei (TbMTAP) and the human (huMTAP) homologs as compared to the human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (huPNP). Motifs search using MEME identified more common patterns and higher relatedness of the parasite proteins to the huMTAP than to the huPNP. The 3D structures of LiMTAP and TbMTAP were predicted by homology modeling and compared to the crystal structure of the huMTAP. These models presented conserved secondary structures compared to the huMTAP, with a similar topology corresponding to the Rossmann fold. This confirmed that both LiMTAP and TbMTAP are members of the NP-I family. In comparison to the huMTAP, the 3D model of LiMTAP showed an additional α-helix, at the C terminal extremity. One peptide located in this specific region was used to generate a specific antibody to LiMTAP. In comparison with the active site (AS) of huMTAP, the parasite ASs presented significant differences in the shape and the electrostatic potentials (EPs). Molecular docking of 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and 5′-hydroxyethylthio-adenosine (HETA) on the ASs on the three proteins predicted differential binding modes and interactions when comparing the parasite proteins to the human orthologue.
