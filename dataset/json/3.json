    "Abstract": "Molecular chaperones HSP90 and HSP70 are essential regulators of the folding and activation of a disparate ensemble of client proteins. They function through ATP hydrolysis and the assembly of multiprotein complexes with cochaperones and clients. While their therapeutic relevance is recognized, important details underlying the links between ATP-dependent conformational dynamics and clients/cochaperones recruitment remain elusive. Allosteric modulators represent fundamental tools to obtain molecular insights into functional regulation. By selective perturbation of different aspects of HSP90/HSP70 activities, allosteric drugs can tune rather than completely inhibit signaling cascades, providing information on the relationships between structure-dynamics and function. Herein, we review advances in the design of HSP90 and HSP70 allosteric modulators. We consider inhibitors and activators in different biochemical and disease models. We discuss these compounds as probes to decipher the complexity of the chaperone machinery and that at the same time represent starting leads for the development of drugs against cancer and neurodegeneration. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Among all of the epigenetic events that are responsible for various diseases such as cancer, lupus, and several birth defects, DNA methylation is one of the crucial ones. It occurs because of the alkylation of various bases. These modifications of genes carried through altered creations of proteins ultimately lead to various diseases. For example, a vital cause behind canine lymphoma is found to be DNA methylation in the guanine base. In this work, we analyzed the methylated and nonmethylated guanine structure with the assistance of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Because of their vulnerability for causing DNA methylation, the N7 and O6 positions of the guanine structure were the positions of interest with the addition of various adducts such as methyl, hydroxyethyl, and deuterated methyl groups. To distinguish the methylated samples from the nonmethylated ones, principal component analysis was performed, and the same analysis was used to distinguish their methylated positions and added adducts. The experimental results were then explained by structure optimization and frequency calculation of the molecules based on DFT calculations. To understand the charge distribution and detect the possible locations of alkylation of DNA bases, electrostatic potential, highest occupied molecular orbital, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for each of the molecules were analyzed, and the reactivity was discussed in the light of electronic structure calculations. The results presented in this study demonstrate a potential label-free technique to examine epigenetic modification of DNA. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The biggest problem with the occurrence of breast cancer is late diagnosis, which is associated with high mortality rates. The aim of the study was to appraise the number of circulating endothelial precursors and the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and the soluble forms of its receptors, sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2, in breast cancer patients with respect to clinicopathological features. Material and methods: The study involved 85 women of Caucasian ethnicity aged 45–66 with primary breast cancer without distant metastases (M0). Inclusion criteria were as follows: histopathological examination confirming the diagnosis of primary breast cancer, without previous radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry evaluation of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, Ki67 expression was made in all cases. In the EDTA-plasma, the concentrations of VEGF-A and its soluble receptors, sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2, were measured applying immunoassay techniques. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were identified with the immune-phenotype CD45 − , CD34 + , CD133 + , CD31 + using flow cytometry. Results: Older women with breast cancer had significantly higher concentrations of VEGF-A as well as sVEGFR2 compared with their younger counterparts. A significantly higher concentration of the soluble form of VEGF receptor type 1 in patients with T1 breast cancer in relation to T2 cases was noted. Also, negative correlations between circulating EPCs and histological grading as well as a soluble form of VEGFR2 with histological grading of breast cancer according to the Elston-Ellis classification were observed. Conclusions: Anti-angiogenic potential is divergent in relation to the clinicopathological determinants. © 2019 Medical University of Bialystok",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Cerebral metastases develop in 10–30% of patients with breast cancer (BC) and in around 3.3 to 4% of patients with ovarian cancer (OC). The aim of the multicenter study is to investigate the correlation between the expression of estrogen alpha receptors (ERα), progesterone receptors (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1), astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG1), depending on the status of BRCA1 protein, in patients suffering from OC and BC with brain metastases. Patients and methods: The analysis included 51 patients: 29 with BC and 22 with OC, in whom brain metastases were disclosed. Results: In most patients (65.5% of BC patients and 68.2% of patients with OC tumors) BRCA1 protein loss was found. No correlation was disclosed between the levels of ERα, PR receptors, HER2, SDF1, CXCR4, AEG1, BRMS1 and BRCA1 status, patient age, stage of disease advancement, grade of histological maturity of the cells, presence of metastases to lymph nodes. A statistically significant correlation was disclosed between the negative expression of PR receptors and a high expression of CXCR4 in patients with BC. High values of the AEG1 protein (linked to metastases) were detected alongside a high expression of BRMS1 (a suppressor of metastases). Conclusions: Patients with BC and OC and brain metastases have a frequent loss of BRCA1 expression. The role of ERα, PR, HER2, SDF1, CXCR4, AEG1, BRMS1 in metastatic process needs further studies. © 2019 Medical University of Bialystok",

    "Abstract": "Background: The relevance of studies focusing on patient satisfaction becomes imperative for patients with cancer, who often face major changes in their lifestyles. Their perceived uncertainty in illness and their personal experiences with the services received are crucial factors for a qualitatively adequate assistance. Objectives: To assess the determinants of patient satisfaction, using a sample of 306 Bulgarian oncology outpatients. Methods: The hypotheses tested concern the extent to which patient satisfaction depends on the uncertainty in illness; the patients’ assessment of technical and interpersonal skills of nurses and medical staff; the information provision; and some organizational aspects. Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire composed of internationally validated scales assessing the determinants of patient satisfaction (measured through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer), uncertainty in illness (assessed through the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale), and patients’ health status (assessed through the EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire and the visual analogue scale). An ordered logit model was run, using the level of overall patient satisfaction as a dependent variable. Results: This is one of the first studies carried out in Bulgaria for oncology patient satisfaction of subjective factors related to the frailty of the oncology patient status such as age, self-assessed health-related quality of life, and uncertainty in illness. Nevertheless, other determinants, reflecting the quality of the care provided, also have an impact on patient satisfaction, namely, the assessment of the nonmedical personnel, the perception of medical technical skills, and the access to a medical center. Conclusions: Results stress the relevance of reducing uncertainty in illness in patients with cancer by implementing a satisfactory patient-physician relationship in the management of the disease. © 2018 ISPOR–The professional society for health economics and outcomes research",

    "Abstract": "We report a methodology to encapsulate gold nanorods (AuNRs) and gold bipyramids (AuBPs) into polyelectrolyte capsules for catalytic application. Microreactors (capsules with encapsulated NRs or BPs) were fabricated by sequential deposition of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) and dextran sulfate on modified sacrificial template, followed by core dissolution. AuNRs and AuBPs of size 25-30 nm were successfully encapsulated in the fabricated polyelectrolyte capsules and were stable and distributed uniformly in the interior. Fabricated microreactors were investigated as catalysts for the reduction of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol in the presence of sodium borohydride in aqueous phase. Reaction parameters such as order, conversion, and rate constants were estimated for microreactors and compared to free anisotropic nanoparticles in suspension. The reaction rate was higher for NRs in both free and capsule forms compared to BPs. Microreactors demonstrated excellent catalytic activity even after three times of use. Such capsules have high potential for use as microreactors in applications such as catalysis, drug delivery, imaging, and cancer chemo-photothermal therapy. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Regional anesthesia may mitigate the risk of persistent postoperative pain (PPP). This Cochrane review, published originally in 2012, was updated in 2017. Methods: We updated our search of Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL to December 2017. Only RCTs investigating local anesthetics (by any route) or regional anesthesia versus any combination of systemic (opioid or non-opioid) analgesia in adults or children, reporting any pain outcomes beyond three months were included. Data were extracted independently by at least two authors, who also appraised methodological quality with Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ assessment and pooled data in surgical subgroups. We pooled studies across different follow-up intervals. As summary statistic, we reported the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals and calculated the number needed to benefit (NNTB). We considered classical, Bayesian alternatives to our evidence synthesis. We explored heterogeneity and methodological bias. Results: 40 new and seven ongoing studies, identified in this update, brought the total included RCTs to 63. We were only able to synthesize data from 39 studies enrolling 3027 participants in a balanced design. Evidence synthesis favored regional anesthesia for thoracotomy (OR 0.52 [0.32 to 0.84], moderate-quality evidence), breast cancer surgery (OR 0.43 [0.28 to 0.68], low-quality evidence), and cesarean section (OR 0.46, [0.28 to 0.78], moderate-quality evidence). Evidence synthesis favored continuous infusion of local anesthetic after breast cancer surgery (OR 0.24 [0.08 to 0.69], moderate-quality evidence), but was inconclusive after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (OR 0.20, [0.04 to 1.09], low-quality evidence). Conclusions: Regional anesthesia reduces the risk of PPP. Small study size, performance, null, and attrition bias considerably weakened our conclusions. We cannot extrapolate to other interventions or to children. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A cryocooler-cooled high-temperature superconducting magnet was constructed, and it was tested on the beam line of the heavy ion medial accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). The magnet consists of a pair of four-stacked racetrack coils wound with RE-123 coated conductor that are plated with 41-μm copper for protection. The magnet has a room temperature beam duct, at which 2.4 T of magnetic field is generated, whereas the maximum magnetic field to which coated conductors are exposed is approximately 4 T. The magnetic field in the beam duct was measured and calculated to examine its stability, which might have been affected by shielding currents in the coated conductors. On the beam line of the HIMAC, at first, the beam guiding by the magnet was demonstrated. The measured beam-guiding characteristics were compared with the beam tracking calculations. Next, a carbon ion beam was injected intentionally into the RE-123 coils of the magnet to simulate the incidents of uncontrolled beam injection into accelerator magnets. Prior to this test, the possible heat deposition to the coil by the beam injection was calculated, and the feasibility of quench protection using a dump resistor was studied through quench experiments using short pieces of the RE-123 coated conductors. © 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: The X-ray screening is one of the most popular methodologies in detection of respiratory system diseases. Chest organs are screened on the film or digital file which go to the doctor for evaluation. However, the analysis of x-ray images requires much experience and time. Clinical decision support is very important for medical examinations. The use of Computational Intelligence can simulate the evaluation and decision processes of a medical expert. We propose a method to provide a decision support for the doctor in order to help to consult each case faster and more precisely. Methods: We use image descriptors based on the spatial distribution of Hue, Saturation and Brightness values in x-ray images, and a neural network co-working with heuristic algorithms (Moth-Flame, Ant Lion) to detect degenerated lung tissues in x-ray image. The neural network evaluates the image and if the possibility of a respiratory disease is detected, the heuristic method identifies the degenerated tissues in the x-ray image in detail based on the use of the proposed fitness function. Results: The average accuracy is 79.06% in pre-detection stage, similarly the sensitivity and the specificity averaged for three pre-classified diseases are 84.22% and 66.7%, respectively. The misclassification errors are 3.23% for false positives and 3.76% for false negatives. Conclusions: The proposed neuro-heuristic approach addresses small changes in the structure of lung tissues, which appear in pneumonia, sarcoidosis or cancer and some consequences that may appear after the treatment. The results show high potential of the newly proposed method. Additionally, the method is flexible and has low computational burden. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The Fenton reaction was discovered over 120 years ago, yet our understanding of the complete reaction mechanism of the seemingly simple iron and hydrogen peroxide reaction (Fe+H 2 O 2 ) remains unclear, thus limiting its full potential. In this work, the aim is to summarize the processes that pertain to the (photo) Fenton reaction. More specifically, this review does not consider previous work relating to the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP)-mediated disinfection/decontamination of stream flows, as much work has successfully achieved this. Instead, this manuscript presents an overview of the other fields of environmental and medical applications of (photo)Fenton: i) surface pre-treatment (nano-particles functionalization or modification), ii) terrestrial and algal biomass (pre)treatment to enhance high value products’ recovery, iii) cancer treatment (malignant tumor elimination) and iv) other medical uses (antibiotics development, wounds disinfection, root canal sterilization and teeth whitening). For each field of application, the focus lies on analyzing the conceptualization and framework of the (photo) Fenton process, the opportunities and limitations, as well as a series of related applications. To conclude, the work discusses the current limitations of the existing applications and future research avenues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The fluorescence labeling of aptamers is a useful technology for aptamer tracking and imaging on the cells. The aptamer SL₂-B, against the heparin binding domain (HBD) of VEGF165 protein, was linked to QDs, producing the QD-SL₂-B aptamer conjugate. The QDs and the QD-aptamer conjugate were characterized and photobleaching effect was studied prior to the cellular incubation. Fluorescence imaging showed that the QD-SL₂-B aptamer conjugate could specifically recognize Hep G2 liver cancer cells and is taken up by the cells without addition of any external transfecting or cell permeabilizing agent. In addition, the results also indicate that incubation time is important for the aptamer cellular uptake and to exhibit its antiproliferative activity on Hep G2 liver cancer cells. This QDs labeling technique provides a new strategy for labeling aptamer molecules for aptamer detection, imaging and understanding their cellular uptake.",

    "Abstract": "Among the different types of polymeric vehicles, (PLGA) is biodegradable and has emerged as promising tool for the delivery of cancer therapeutics. The salient features of PLGA micro carriers include prolonged circulation time, increased tumor localization and biodegradability and effectiveness of the therapeutics. We have synthesized PLGA microspheres where curcumin can be loaded and thereby increases its bioavailability. The cytotoxicity of curcumin (PLGA@CCM) microspheres was evaluated on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. They were found to induce apoptosis by perturbing the mitochondrial membrane potential. PLGA@CCM@FA induces apoptosis in human triple negative breast cancer cells by up-regulating Cleaved caspase-3 and down regutes p-AKT. The in-vivo study in BALB/C mice model exhibited more tumor regression in case of PLGA@CCM@FA microspheres. Our results suggests that these microspheres can be an effective vehicle for delivery of hydrophobic drugs to the folate over expressed cancer cells.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is a rapidly advancing field that may improve outcomes in several cancer types. Although screening has decreased colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, it remains a common and often fatal malignancy. In this study, we sought to identify an optical imaging agent for the application of FGS technology to CRC. Methods: We compared a panitumumab-IRDye800CW conjugate to an IgG-IRDye800CW isotype control. Mice were implanted with one of three CRC cell lines (LS174T, Colo205, and SW948) and imaged with open- and closed-filed fluorescence imaging systems. Fluorescent contrast was quantified by calculating the ratio between tumor and background fluorescence. After 10 d, the mice were sacrificed, and their tumors stained for microscopic imaging. Results: Panitumumab-IRDye800CW produced significantly greater (P < 0.05) fluorescent contrast in all three cell lines. Average tumor to background ratio was 6.00 versus 2.60 for LS174T, 5.78 versus 2.52 for Colo205, and 4.31 versus 1.70 for SW948. A 1-mg tumor fragment produced significantly greater fluorescent contrast in the Colo205 and SW948 cell lines in the panitumumab-IRDye800CW group. Western blotting for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a semiquantitative analysis of EGFR expression noted strong expression in all three cell lines; however, EGFR expression did not directly correlate to tumor to background ratio. Conclusions: Panitumumab-IRDye800CW produces significantly greater fluorescent contrast than IgG-IRDye800CW in a murine model of CRC and is a suitable agent for the application of FGS technology to CRC. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Due to the advantage of achieving a better performance under weak regularization, elastic net has attracted wide attention in statistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and other fields. In particular, a variation of the elastic net, adaptive elastic net (AEN), integrates the adaptive grouping effect. In this paper, we aim to develop a new algorithm: Adaptive Elastic Net with Conditional Mutual Information (AEN-CMI) that further improves AEN by incorporating conditional mutual information into the gene selection process. We apply this new algorithm to screen significant genes for two kinds of cancers: colon cancer and leukemia. Compared with other algorithms including Support Vector Machine, Classic Elastic Net, Adaptive Lasso and Adaptive Elastic Net, the proposed algorithm, AEN-CMI, obtains the best classification performance using the least number of genes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "As a universal tumor biomarker, research on the activity and inhibition of telomerase is of great importance for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we demonstrate the conformational switch-based fluorescence detection of telomerase activity using a redesigned RNA aptamer Spinach. Briefly, the original Spinach aptamer was extended at its 5′ end and folded into an inactive conformation, where association with the small molecule fluorophore, 5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI) was prevented. Only in the presence of telomerase, (TTAGGG) n repeats were added to the 3′ end of the telomerase substrate primer, and the elongation products hybridized with inactive Spinach molecules, triggering its conformational switch and refolding it into the active, DFHBI-binding conformation. Moreover, the fluorescence signal was further amplified through a target recycling circuit, where Ribonuclease H (RNase H) specifically hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bonds of RNA in the DNA-RNA hybrid. The released telomere products could then hybridize to new inactive Spinach molecules and initiate multiple amplification cycles. The proposed fluorescent biosensor presented great performance for telomerase activity detection from 100 to 5 × 10 4 Hela cells with a detection limit of 100 cells. Besides, this new assay offers a good biosensing platform for differentiation of cancer cell lines from normal cell line and evaluation the inhibition efficiency of telomere-binding ligand, which is of great importance for telomerase-related cancer diagnosis and therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) has been recognized as an important biomarker for the early diagnosis and management of breast cancer. However, there is still challenge in the clinical detection of HER2. In this work, a simple strategy for “turn on” fluorescent detection of HER2 with ultra-sensitivity and high specificity was developed. Herein, HER2-binding aptamer (HApt) and DNA2 containing G-rich sequences, templated sequences for Ag nanoclusters (AgNCs), and complementary bases at both ends were involved to achieve the double stranded DNA templated AgNCs (dsDNA-AgNCs) as a fluorescence probe for HER2 detection. In the presence of HER2, the highly specific binding of HER2 to HApt caused HApt separating from dsDNA-AgNCs, resulting in the folding of DNA2-AgNCs because of the complementary bases at both ends, which led to AgNCs’ proximity to G-rich sequences, and therefore the enhanced fluorescence intensity. By monitoring the change in fluorescence signal (ΔF), HER2 was measured, and a linear range from 8.5 fM to 225 fM with a limit of detection (LOD) 0.0904 fM was obtained. More significantly, the detection of HER2 in serum samples was achieved with high accuracy, and the breast cancer patients were successfully discriminated from healthy persons. In summary, this strategy is simple, time-saving, cost-effective, ultrasensitive, specific, universal and more applicable for the detection of HER2. Therefore, we expect this present aptasensor can be used in the clinical detection of biomakers, which lays a potential foundation for the early diagnosis of cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The majority of eukaryotic regulated protein turnover is performed by the proteasome, a multi-catalytic enzyme. Due to the fact that proteasome enzyme abnormal functioning was observed in different malignant cells, the proteasome is becoming a target for medical treatment. In order to evaluate the mechanisms of action of pharmaceutical compounds on proteasome enzyme inhibition, detecting and characterizing its activity is essential. An electrochemical assay that allows the monitoring of the chymotrypsin-like activity and inhibition of the 20S proteasome enzyme, based on the electrochemical detection of an electroactive compound released upon proteolysis of an adequate chymotrypsin-substrate is described. By employing differential pulse voltammetric measurement, the activity of the 20S proteasome enzyme was investigated for different incubation times of 20S with oligopeptide substrate as well as for different concentrations of substrate. Enzyme kinetic parameters were determined by voltammetry and the electrochemical assay compared with fluorescence spectroscopy. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and atomic force microscopy were also used to investigate substrate interaction with the 20S proteasome and their adsorption at the electrode surface. Finally, the new electrochemical assay allowed to investigate the mechanisms of two different proteasome inhibitor drugs, bortezomib and oprozomib, underlying the applicability of the assay for understanding proteasome inhibitor action. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Mouse melanoma B16-BL6 cells are useful cells for cancer metastatic studies. To understand the metastatic principle at molecular levels, it is necessary to carry out experiments in which cancer cells and their normal counterparts are compared. However, unlike normal human melanocytes, preparation of normal mouse melanocytes is quite difficult due to the lack of marketing and insufficient information on an established protocol for primary culture of mouse melanocytes. In this study, we aimed to establish a convenient method for primary culture of mouse melanocytes on the basis of the protocol for human melanocytes. The main obstacles to preparing pure mouse melanocytes are how to digest mouse skin tissue and how to reduce the contamination of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The obstacles were overcome by collagenase digestion for skin specimens, short time trypsinization for separating melanocytes and keratinocytes, and use of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and cholera toxin in the culture medium. These supplements act to prevent the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. The convenient procedure enabled us to prepare a pure culture of normal mouse melanocytes. Using enriched normal mouse melanocytes and cancerous B16-BL6 cells, we compared the expression levels of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), an important membrane protein for melanoma metastasis, in the cells. The results showed markedly higher expression of MCAM in B16-BL6 cells than in normal mouse melanocytes. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Differences in clinical staging and survival among pancreatic head, body, and tail cancers are not well defined. We aim to identify the prognostic relevance of primary tumor location in patients undergoing treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Materials and methods: The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with PDAC from 1998 to 2011 (n = 175,556). Patients were categorized by primary tumor site into head (67.5%, n = 118,343), body (15.5%, n = 27,218), and tail (17.0%, n = 29,885) groups. Univariate and Cox regression analyses were used to determine covariates associated with overall survival (OS). Results: Patients with head PDAC presented with earlier stage disease (39.2% Stage I/II versus 19.7% versus 16.0%, P < 0.001) and underwent resection more often (27.9% versus 10.7% versus 17.0%, P < 0.001) than those with body or tail tumors. Of surgically resected PDAC, those localized to the head had advanced pathologic stage (84.8% stage II/III versus 66.6% versus 65.6%, P < 0.001), higher nodal positivity (64.9% versus 45.8% versus 45%, P < 0.001), and worse tumor grade (35.9% poorly differentiated versus 29.5% versus 27.8%, P < 0.001). Despite increased utilization of adjuvant therapies (54.4% versus 45.6% versus 42.0%, P < 0.001), patients with head PDAC had inferior OS compared with those with body and tail tumors (P < 0.001). Conclusions: When examining patients with PDAC undergoing resection, tumor localization to the head is associated with improved resectability because they present earlier. Of resected PDACs, however, those localized to the head have worse OS compared with body and tail tumors. This discrepancy may represent a combination of lead time and selection biases and biologic differences between tumor sites. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Detection and identification of bitter compounds draw great attention in pharmaceutical and food industry. Several well-known agonists of specific bitter taste receptors have been found to exhibit anti-cancer effects. For example, N-C=S-containing compounds, such as allyl-isothiocyanates, have shown cancer chemo-preventive effects. It is worth noting that human T2R38 receptor is specific for compounds containing N-C=S moiety. Here, a bioinspired cell-based bioelctronic tongue (BioET) is developed for the high-specificity isothiocyanate-induced bitter detection, utilizing human Caco-2 cells as a primary sensing element and interdigitated impedance sensor as a secondary transducer. As an intestinal carcinoma cell line, Caco-2 endogenously expresses human bitter receptor T2R38, and the activation of T2R38 induces the changes of cellular morphology which can be detected by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). After configuration and optimization of parameters including timing of compound administration and cell density, quantitative bitter evaluation models were built for two well-known bitter compounds, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and propylthiouracil (PROP). The bitter specific detection of this BioET is inhibited by probenecid and U-73122, and is not elicited by other taste modalities or bitter ligands that do not activate T2R38. Moreover, by combining different computational tools, we designed a ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) protocol to select ligands that are likely to activate T2R38 receptor. Three computationally predicted agonists of T2R38 were selected using the LBVS protocol, and the BioET presented response to the predicted agonists, validating the capability of the LBVS protocol. This study suggests this unique cell-based BioET paves a general and promising way to specifically detect N-C=S-containing compounds that can be used for pharmaceutical study and drug development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The human 6-O-endosulfatases HSulf-1 and -2 catalyze the region-selective hydrolysis of the 6-O-sulfate group of the glucosamine residues within sulfated domains of heparan sulfate, thereby ensuring a unique and original post-biosynthetic modification of the cell surface proteoglycans. While numerous studies point out the role of HSulf-2 in crucial physiological processes as well as in pathological conditions particularly in cancer, its structural organization in two chains and its functional properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we report the first characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) of HSulf-2. An average molecular weight of 133,115 Da was determined for the whole enzyme by MALDI-TOF MS, i.e. higher than the naked amino acid backbone (98,170 Da), highlighting a significant contribution of post-translational modifications. The HSulf-2 protein sequence was determined by Nano-LC-MS/MS, leading to 63% coverage and indicating at least four N-glycosylation sites at Asn 108, 147, 174 and 217. These results provide a platform for further structural investigations of the HSulf enzymes, aiming at deciphering the role of each chain in the substrate binding and specificities and in the catalytic activities. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Small well-defined spherical gold nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple non-physical method based on a mixture of gold salt, tetraethylene oxide and water, free of any additional reducing chemical agent or physical method. The ratio of tetraethylene oxide to water was optimized to achieve a fast synthesis within 30 min. Transmission electron microscopy images showed well dispersed gold nanospheres with a size ranging from 10 to 15 nm. XPS was used to confirm the oxidation state of gold nanoparticles and the oxidation products from tetraethylene oxide after the reaction. This new protocol performed in sustainable and biocompatible conditions is complementary to the current methods used to synthesize gold nanospheres. In order to use these particles in biological samples, we correlated the atomic absorption with the colorimetric concentration of nanospheres in solution. After 24 h of incubation of cancer or neuronal cell lines with these nanoparticles, transmission electron microscopy images showed similar cellular uptake in both cell lines, especially in cytoplasmic vesicular structures.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Improvement of lymphadenectomy in right colectomy requires removal of all tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric vessels beneath the pancreatic notch. Short- and long-term bowel motility disorders after D3 extended mesenterectomy with consecutive superior mesenteric plexus transection are studied. Methods: Patients without pre-existing motility disorders undergoing D3 extended mesenterectomy were examined 3 times using the wireless motility capsule: before, at 3 wk, and 6 mo after surgery. Segmental transit times and contractility were analyzed using mixed effect modeling. Correlation between contractility and transit time was assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Fifteen patients (4 men), with median age 62 y, were included. Mean values for the three consecutive examinations are as follows. Gastric transit time increased from 237 to 402 and 403 min, respectively. Small bowel transit time decreased from 246 to 158 (P < 0.01) and 199 (P = 0.03) min, respectively. Colonic transit time decreased from 1742 to 1450 and 1110 (P = 0.02) min, respectively. Gastric contractions per minute (CPM) varied from 1.73 to 1.05 (P = 0.01) and 2.47 (P < 0.01), respectively. Small bowel CPM decreased from 3.43 to 2.68 and 3.34, respectively. Colonic CPM ranged from 1.59 to 1.45 and 1.91 (P = 0.08), respectively. Correlation between small bowel (SB) transit time and CPM was −0.45 (P = 0.09) preoperatively, and −0.03 (P = 0.91) 6 mo postoperatively. Conclusions: Extrinsic SB denervation leads to significantly accelerated SB transit, reduced contractility, and disturbed correlation between transit time and contractility early after denervation. Both number of contractions and transit time in the denervated SB show a clear tendency toward normalization at 6 mo. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Taxus wallichiana (Himalayan yew) has been subjected to over-exploitation for its anti-cancer ingredient Taxol. As a consequence, the species has already become endangered, facing enhanced threats of regional extinction. To compound this, the species shows high vulnerability to climate change impacts that may significantly reduce its present climatic niche. In spite of the ecological and enormous commercial importance of the species, the direct or indirect impacts of climate change on the species are not yet well-researched and well-documented. To develop sustainable adaptation pathways to conserve the surviving populations of the species, it is important to have precise assessments of the future distribution ranges of the species. The present study models the potential current and future distribution ranges of Taxus wallichiana based on its suitable climatic envelop developed under a baseline scenario (1960–1990) and climate change scenarios centred on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the year 2070, as provided in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the UNO's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The projected shrink in climatic niche of Taxus wallichiana by 28% (RCP 4.5) and 31% (RCP 8.5) highlights the vulnerability of the endangered species to climate change impacts and the perturbations on the structure of mountain ecosystem. It raises an alarm for immediate conservation of geographic areas that can provide potential refuge to the species under the adverse climate change impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Prunus spinosa L. (blackthorn) flower was most recently pointed out as a valuable source of bioactive compounds that have potent anticancer properties. To test for antineoplastic activity, hepatocarcinoma cells (Hepa 1–6) and corresponding non-neoplastic hepatocytes (AML 12) were subjected to Prunus spinosa L. blossom ethanolic extract (5–200 μg mL −1 ). Antiproliferative activity was determined by Trypan Blue (TB) and Kenacid Blue (KB) methods after 24 and 72 h. Inhibitory effects on Hepa 1–6 proliferation were observed at all concentrations with significant inhibition at ≥ 100 μg mL −1 (p &lt;.025–p &lt;.001) determined with both methods. Cytotoxicity was also detected in non-neoplastic hepatocytes with significant doses above 10 μg mL −1 (p &lt;.05–p &lt;.001) after 72 h. Cellular viability loss after 24 h was more pronounced in non-neoplastic vs. hepatocarcinoma cells as confirmed with IC 50TB values (half maximal inhibitory concentration): 59.05 μg mL −1 in AML 12 vs. 166.87 μg mL −1 in Hepa 1–6 cells and IC 50KB : 72.69 vs. 172.93 μg mL −1 , respectively. Prolonged incubation (72 h) resulted in almost equal toxicity in both cell lines. Prooxidative activity of blackthorn flower extract was observed in both cell lines with higher ROS formation in neoplastic cells. Cell death was primarily through necrosis. The proportion of apoptotic cells in both cultures was low: fraction of early apoptosis – 0.04–1.65% of the total cell population and fraction of late apoptosis: only 0.05–3.25%. © 2019 South African Association of Botanists",

    "Abstract": "Diseases occurring near the vocal cords, such as laryngeal cancer, share the initial symptom of hoarseness of voice. The GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) scale is used as an acoustic diagnostic method for these diseases, but its objectivity is not well established. Instead, more accurate diagnosis may be possible by capturing the waveform of the volume velocity at the vocal cords. The aim of this study is to enable voice disturbances to be diagnosed by identifying the sound-source waveform from voice measurements. For acoustic analysis of the vocal tract, we modeled the air inside it as concentrated masses connected by linear springs and dampers. We identified the shape of the vocal tract by making the natural frequencies of the analytical model correspond to the measured formant frequencies, and we calculated the sound-source waveform from the measured voice waveform. To assess the validity of the model, we measured actual voices and used the model to identify the vocal tract shapes and corresponding sound-source waveforms. The identified waveforms have an asymmetrical triangular form, which is a feature of actual human sound-source waveforms. Local solutions allow multiple vocal tract shapes to be identified from a single sample. However, mathematical analysis showed that these differ only in the amplitude of the sound-source waveform, which does not affect the waveform shape. Furthermore, we built an experimental device that simulates the human voice mechanism and comprises an acrylic vocal tract and a piston. We confirmed that the identified sound sources are similar to measured sound sources. We therefore conclude that our proposed methods are valid. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Fractional calculus is a field of mathematics in considerable expansion and has been understood as a tool with a wide range of applications, including in biological systems. Cancer dormancy is a state in which cancer cells have an intrinsic rate of reduced proliferation over a period of time, after which they arise with an accelerated growth rate, usually triggering metastases. This work investigates via fractional calculus two proposed ordinary differential equation systems via fractional calculus, which address dynamics between tumor cells and the immune system. Analyses and comparison processes are performed through an analytical study about the equilibrium points of each model and numerical simulations by the Nonstandard Finite Difference (NSFD) method. The analytical and numerical results show two important behaviors associated with tumor dormancy. The first refers to qualitative changes in the stability of an equilibrium point, which strongly depend on the order of the derivative and represent scenarios where there is no cancer escape. The second behavior refers to changes in the damping of some solutions, which can represent longer periods of time to exit the state of dormancy. In this case, different orders used in the derivatives are investigated, as well as their influence on the behavior of the solutions against the main parameters of the model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Microfluidics brings unique opportunities for engineering micro-/nanomaterials with well-controlled physicochemical properties. Herein, using a miniaturized multi-run spiral-shaped microreactor, we develop a flow synthesis strategy to continuously produce hollow spherical silica (HSS) with hierarchical sponge-like pore sizes ranging from several nanometers to over one hundred nanometers. The formation of HSS is realized by mixing two reactant flows, one containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and diluted ammonia and the other 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) and diluted tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), at a flow rate as high as 5 mL/min. The effect of the reactant concentration and the flow rate on the structural change of the resultant materials is examined. Functional small-sized nanoparticles (magnetic nanoparticle, quantum dot, and silver nanoparticle) can be separately assembled into HSS and high molecular weight protein (bovine serum albumin) can be successfully loaded into HSS and delivered into cancer cells afterward, making them promising in the fields of separation and purification, bioimaging, catalysis, and theranostics. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapies are at the forefront of the fight against cancers, and researchers continue to develop and test novel immunotherapeutic modalities. Ideal cancer immunotherapies induce a patient's immune system to kill their own cancer and develop long-lasting immunity. Research has demonstrated a critical requirement for CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in achieving durable responses. In the path to the clinic, researchers require robust tools to effectively evaluate the capacity for immunotherapies to generate adaptive anti-tumor responses. To study functional tumor-specific T cells, researchers have relied on targeting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or the inclusion of surrogate transgenes in pre-clinical models, which facilitate detection of T cells by using the targeted antigen(s) in peptide re-stimulation or tetramer-staining assays. Unfortunately, many pre-clinical models lack a defined TAA, and epitope mapping of TAAs is costly. Surrogate transgenes can alter tumor engraftment and influence the immunogenicity of tumors, making them less relevant to clinical tumors. Further, some researchers prefer to develop therapies that do not rely on pre-defined TAAs. Here, we describe a method to exploit major histocompatibility complex expression on murine cancer cell lines in a co-culture assay to detect T cells responding to bulk, undefined, tumor antigens. This is a tool to support the preclinical evaluation of novel, antigen-agnostic immunotherapies. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry various molecules involved in intercellular communication and have raised great interest as drug delivery systems. Several engineering methods have been investigated for vesicle loading. Here, we studied the electroporation of EVs isolated from plasma to load antitumor microRNAs (miRNAs). First, we optimized the transfection protocol using miRNA cel-39 by evaluating different parameters (voltage and pulse) for their effect on vesicle morphology, loading capacity, and miRNA transfer to target cells. When compared with direct incubation of EVs with miRNA, mild electroporation allowed more efficient loading and better protection of miRNA from RNase degradation. Moreover, electroporation preserved the naive vesicle cargo, including RNAs and proteins, and their ability to be taken up by target cells, supporting the absence of vesicle damage. EVs engineered with antitumor miRNAs (miR-31 and miR-451a) successfully promoted apoptosis of the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, silencing target genes involved in anti-apoptotic pathways. Our findings indicate an efficient and functional miRNA encapsulation in plasma-derived EVs following an electroporation protocol that preserves EV integrity. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer have an extremely poor 5-year survival rate of 5%. In comparison, all other bladder cancers (BCs) have a 5-year survival rate of 77%. This striking contrast indicates that one of the therapeutic kernels for bladder cancer is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its invasiveness and metastasis. In the current study, we demonstrated that maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is significantly downregulated in human invasive bladder cancers in comparison to non-invasive bladder cancers, and that ectopic expression of MEG3 dramatically inhibits the invasiveness of human bladder cancer cells. Consistently, ectopic expression of MEG3 also attenuates metastatic ability of T24T cells, a cell line derived from T24 cells, in the lungs of nude mice. Our mechanistic studies reveal that MEG3, as a ceRNA, inhibits the invasiveness of human bladder cancer cells via negative regulation of c-Myc by competing with PHLPP2 mRNA for miR-27a. These findings not only provide a novel insight into understanding the mechanisms behind the MEG3 inhibition of bladder cancer cell invasion, but also reveal the potential for use of MEG3 as a tool for the prevention and therapy of invasive bladder cancer. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: We aimed to review the burden and the potential impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines on HPV-related diseases in the Republic of Korea and to discuss cervical cancer prevention practices in this country. Methods: Cancer burden statistics were retrieved from GLOBOCAN-2018 and Statistics Korea. HPV disease burden was assessed via systematic review. Vaccine types relative contribution (RC) was estimated using data from an international project using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Results: Despite a downtrend in cervical cancer in recent years, Korean rates remain high. In contrast, oropharyngeal cancer incidence has gradually increased and other anogenital cancers remain rare. In Korea, HPV prevalence in general population is around 20%. In cervical cancer, RC of HPVs 16/18 (74.0%) increased to 92.0% when including HPVs 31/33/45/52/58. Limited information was available for other HPV-related cancer sites. Regarding prevention, since the inclusion of the HPV vaccine into the National Immunization Program, almost half (49%) of the target cohort in 2016 had received the first dose of vaccine. Further, percentage of women screened with pap has increased from 41.1%-2009 to 53.0%-2016. Conclusions: HPV-related disease burden in Korea is significant. Results suggest that the combination of effective and high coverage HPV vaccination and screening programmes could substantially impact on HPV-related disease in Korea. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "We examined what proportion of the U.S. population with no personal cancer history reported receiving either genetic counseling or genetic testing for cancer risk, and also the association of these behaviors with cancer risk perceptions. We used data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey. Objective relative risk scores for breast (women) and colorectal (men and women) cancer risk were generated for individuals without a personal history of cancer. Participants' risk perceptions were compared with their objective relative risk. Of 12,631 women, 1.2% reported receiving genetic counseling and 0.8% genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer risk. Of 15,085 men and women, 0.8% reported receiving genetic counseling and 0.3% genetic testing for hereditary colorectal cancer risk. Higher breast cancer risk perception was associated with genetic counseling (OR: 4.31, 95%CI: 2.56, 7.26) and testing (OR: 3.56, 95%CI: 1.80, 7.03). Similarly, higher perception of colorectal cancer risk was associated with genetic counseling (OR: 5.04, 95%CI: 2.57, 9.89) and testing (OR: 5.92, 95%CI: 2.40, 14.63). A higher proportion of individuals with colorectal cancer risk perceptions concordant with their objective risk (vs. discordant) had undergone genetic counseling or testing for colorectal cancer risk. Concordant risk perceptions for breast cancer were not associated with breast cancer genetic counseling or testing. Given frequent dialogue about implementing population level programs involving genetic services for cancer risk, policy makers and investigators should consider the role of risk perceptions in the effectiveness and design of such programs and potential strategies for addressing inaccuracies in risk perceptions. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cancer has high incidence in both developed and developing countries. Epidemiological data on the rate of cancer incidence in Brazil appears not to have a strong impact on government policies to fund research and innovation in health, particularly in oncology. This study aimed to verify this suspicion by retrospectively analysing data from the Brazilian government's Financier of Studies and Projects (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP) and The National Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial, INPI) on cancer research and innovation in Brazil from 1998 to 2013. Our results indicated that, in the study period, the increased rate of cancer incidence in Brazil was not accompanied by government funding for cancer research since only 9% of the budget approved to health research, and innovation, was spent on cancer research. In addition, the number of projects approved for developing infrastructure to support cancer research was limited, corresponding to 0.46% of the total budget. The number of applications for registration of patents of chemical and biotechnological drugs for cancer showed a reduction, reflecting the low investment in oncology. In conclusion, there are deficits in governmental funding of cancer research and innovation in Brazil. Therefore, effective measures to coordinate funding policies and effective criteria for funding allocation should be implemented to avoid further negative consequences for the population and the public health scenario. Moreover, increased governmental and non-governmental funding could help to improve the current precarious situation that limits the population's access to health goods and services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is common cancer among women with high morbidity. MicroRNAs (miRs) are involved in the progression and development of cervical cancer. This study aimed to explore the effect of miR-99b-5p (miR-99b) on invasion and migration in cervical cancer through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The microarray-based analysis was used to screen out differentially expressed miRNAs. Expression of miR-99b, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) was determined in both cervical cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues. Next, alteration of miR-99b expression in cervical cancer was conducted to evaluate levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, p70S6K matrix metallopeptidase 2, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, as well as the effect of miR-99b on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that miR-99b expression was decreased and levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and p70S6K were elevated in cervical cancer tissues. More important, overexpressed miR-99b repressed the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, blocked cell cycle entry, and promoted apoptosis in cervical cancer. These results indicate that miR-99b attenuates the migration and invasion of human cervical cancer cells through downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which provides a therapeutic approach for cervical cancer treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer has emerged as the most common female malignancy globally and in Nigeria in the past few decades. Little is currently known at the household level about breast cancer screening practices of the Nigerian women. Study objectives: The study assessed awareness, knowledge and practice of women in Ogbomoso South Local Government Area (LGA) on breast cancer screening. Methodology: The study employed Community-based cross-sectional design and multi-stage sampling technique was used to recruit 332 consenting women. Interviewer-guided, self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 40.8 ± 13 years; 44.9% of the women had ever screened for breast cancer. Factors that were significantly associated with practice of breast cancer screening included having tertiary education (p < 0.001), ever use of family planning methods (p = 0.018), ever heard of breast cancer (p < 0.001), ever heard of breast examination (p<0.001), having relatives who had died of breast cancer (p = 0.018) and having good knowledge of the disease (p < 0.001). Women who were aware of screening were eight times more likely to have practised breast cancer screening compared to those who had no knowledge (aOR 7.6, 95%CI 4.1–14.2). Conclusion: Knowledge and practice of breast cancer screening were low among community based women. There is urgent need to intensify breast cancer awareness campaigns among this population in Nigeria. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer continues to be a major public health problem. Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in the initiation and progression of cancer, few studies focus on the lncRNAs in the cervical cancer. Here, we systematically studied the clinical information, transcriptome profiling, and methylation array data of cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma that retrieved from genomic data commons (GDC). Compared with protein-coding genes, the expression levels of pseudogenes and lncRNAs were much lower. A total of 190 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 2,326 protein-coding genes were identified. Meanwhile, 269 differentially methylation regions (DMRs), where 16 lncRNAs were located, were figured out. Only one lncRNA, LINC00592, which was located in the DMRs, was also found differentially expressed. Several transcriptional regulation genes, such as ZNF20, ZNF441, ZNF573, and TMF1, were highly correlated with the expression of LINC00592, which illustrated its possible function on the transcription. Two microRNAs, which were both associated with tumor progression, can bind to LINC00592. Moreover, LINC00592 were also differentially expressed in other tumors. We proposed, with the help of various databases, that LINC00592 is a potential cancer-related lncRNA in cervical cancer and might activate the cancer progression through the regulation of transcription or structural integrity. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Considering the drawbacks in the cancer chemotherapies, there is an unmet need for alternative therapeutic approaches such as herbal medicines. The aim of this study was assessment the anticancer effect of Physalis alkekengi (P. alkekengi) hydroalcoholic extract on mouse model of breast cancer. The therapeutic and anticancer effect of a P. alkekengi hydroalcoholic extract was investigated using an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer mouse model. We observed that the extract of P. alkekengi inhibited the growth of the breast cancer cells at the two higher doses (50 and 100 mg/kg). Accordingly, we found a significant histopathologic alteration in the breast cancer cells in group treated with the P. alkekengi hydroalcoholic extract compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, we observed that the P. alkekengi extract could significantly increase the mRNA level expression of apoptosis specific gene Bax in the effective dosage treated group (50 mg/kg). Our findings revealed that the hydroalcoholic extract of P. alkekengi has an incredible efficacy for the treatment of estrogen-positive breast cancer by promoting the apoptotic pathways into this tumor type. Further studies are essential regarding complete verification of it safety and anticancer effects on other cancer types. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Successful treatment of pancreatic cancer, which has the highest mortality rate among all types of malignancies, has challenged oncologists for decades, and early detection would undoubtedly increase favorable patient outcomes. The identification of proteins involved in pancreatic cancer progression could lead to biomarkers for early detection of this disease. This study identifies one potential candidate, cylindromatosis (CYLD), a deubiquitinase and microtubule-binding protein that plays a suppressive role in pancreatic cancer development. In pancreatic cancer samples, downregulation of CYLD expression resulted from a loss in the copy number of the CYLD gene; additionally, reduced expression of CYLD negatively correlated with the clinicopathological parameters. Further study demonstrated that CYLD deficiency promoted colony formation in vitro and pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that CYLD is essential for spindle orientation and properly oriented cell division; CYLD deficiency resulted in a substantial increase in chromosome missegregation. Taken together, these data indicate a critical role for CYLD in suppressing pancreatic tumorigenesis, implicating its potential as a biomarker for early detection of pancreatic cancer and a prognostic indicator of patient outcomes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "As an over-expressed flavoprotein in several kinds of tumor cells, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) is considered as a potent biomarker in early-stage cancer diagnosis. Developing a fast, selective and sensitive method of monitoring NQO1 on cellular level will greatly promote cancer diagnosis in clinical practice. In this paper, a fast NQO1 responsive fluorescence probe SYZ-30 containing quinone acid and 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) fluorophore is constructed. The probe could selectively respond to NQO1 and rapidly emit strong fluorescence in vitro within only 5 min. Notably, the peak fluorescent intensities at 550 nm showed a linear relationship with NQO1 concentrations in the range of 3–30 ng/ml and limit of detection (LOD) was 0.0667 ng/ml. Furthermore, it was validated that the probe has good biocompatibility and could be applied for bio-imaging in NQO1 over-expressed cancer cells, together with its mitochondria targeting ability. Importantly, confocal fluorescence imaging confirmed the NQO1 detection ability on cellular level, which can be used for real-time detection of several cancer subtypes like adenocarcinoma. To conclude, the probe is rapidly responsive, highly sensitive and selective which will potentially become a practical tool for early cancer detection and diagnosis. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is the most common cause of female cancer-related mortality worldwide. Decreased expression of long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) is found in human cervical cancer tissues and associated with poor prognosis. However, the studies on associations between GAS5 level and malignant phenotypes, as well as sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug in cervical cancer cells are limited. In this study, overexpression of GAS5 in cervical cancer cells resulted in prohibited cell proliferation and colony formation, which were promoted by siGAS5. Enhanced GAS5 increased cell percentage in the G0/G1 phase and decreased cells percentage in the S phase, whereas reduced expression did not. The malignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells, manifested by cell migration and invasion, could be weakened by the GAS5 overexpression and enhanced by siGAS5. Furthermore, in cisplatin-induced cell, overexpression of GAS5 reduced cells viability and enhanced apoptosis, whereas in cells transfected with siGAS5, apoptosis eliminated. We have reported the upregulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and its oncogenetic roles in cervical cancer previously. In this study, we found the negative relationship between the GAS5 and miR-21. Moreover, the decrease of miR-21 associated proteins phosphorylated STAT3 and E2F3 was seen in GAS5 overexpressed cells, both of which could be increased by siGAS5. The GAS5 deficiency also reduced miR-21 target proteins TIMP3 and PDCD4 expressions. Taken together, the GAS5 expression level is inversely associated with malignancy, but positively associated with sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that GAS5 could be a biomarker of cisplatin-resistance in clinical therapy of human cervical cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is one of the most aggressive and pervasive cancers identified in females. Sirt1 and CD36 both exert an essential role toward the oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells. As reported, the adrenergic signaling could promote the malignancy of breast cancer. This study focuses specifically on the role of Sirt1/CD36 in the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and also investigates their response to the α2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (Dex). Materials and Methods: Expression of Sirt1 and CD36 was measured in breast cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry. We cultured MCF7 cells and treated cells with resveratrol (RSV) or Dex. Western blot analysis was performed to quantify the protein expression levels. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was applied to detect cell proliferation. Results: Compared with normal adjacent tissues, Sirt1 increased and CD36 decreased in cancer tissues. RSV, a Sirt1 activator, increased the proliferation of MCF-7 cells at low concentration but exerted cytotoxicity effect at higher concentration. Sirt1 activation increased the expression of CD36 at higher concentration. Dex treatment gradually increased the proliferation of MCF7 cells in a dose-dependent manner and downregulated the expression of Sirt1/CD36. Interestingly, overexpression of Sirt1 via RSV pretreatment could suppress Dex-stimulated proliferation of breast cancer, accompanied with CD36 upregulation. Conclusions: though expression of Sirt1 increased in breast cancer progression, overexpression of Sirt1 could inhibit MCF7 proliferation, which may be associated with CD36 upregulation. In addition, the promotion effect of Dex on MCF7 cells, which may be associated with the Sirt1/CD36 inhibition, could be weakened by Sirt1 activation via RSV. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Despite being preventable, cervical cancer remains the most common cancer among women in Nepal, a country where there is no nationwide screening programme. Hence, the objective was to investigate and better understand Nepali women's perceptions on barriers to participation in cervical cancer screening and what might facilitate their participation. Methods: A qualitative study design with focus group discussions was employed and women were purposively invited. The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using manifest content analysis. Findings: Women had misconceptions about the screening and low levels of knowledge. Sociocultural barriers, service providers’ behaviour, geographical challenges, and limited finances were all perceived as obstacles to attending screening centres. Facilitating factors, such as participation in awareness programmes and support from family and women's groups, may convince women to attend screening clinics. Conclusions: The findings contribute information on Nepalese women's perceptions of cervical cancer screening. They may serve to support the Government of Nepal's promotion of cervical cancer screening and treatment as a right for all Nepali women, whenever necessary. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Stromal interaction molecules STIM1 and STIM2 are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ sensors that initiate store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE). The roles of STIM1-mediated SOCE in cancer biology have been highlighted in different types of cancer, but that of STIM2 is unknown. By the model of cervical cancer, here we focus on the cooperative regulation of SOCE by STIM proteins and their distinct roles in cellular function. Immunofluorescent stainings of surgical specimens of cervical cancer show that STIM1 and STIM2 are abundant in tumor tissues, but STIM1 is the major ER Ca 2+ sensor identified in the invasive front of cancer tissues. STIM1 or STIM2 overexpression in cervical cancer SiHa cells induces an upregulated SOCE. Regarding cellular function, STIM1 and STIM2 are necessary for cell proliferation, whereas STIM1 is the dominant ER Ca 2+ sensor involved in cell migration. During SOCE, STIM1 is aggregated and translocated towards the Orai1-containing plasma membrane in association with the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB1. In contrast, STIM2 is constitutively aggregated without significant trafficking or association with microtubules. These results show the distinct role of STIM1 and STIM2 in SOCE and cellular function of cervical cancer cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid proliferation and metastasis of breast cancers resulted in poor prognosis in clinic. Recent studies have proved that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in tumor progression. In this study, we aimed to determine the roles and mechanisms of lncRNA–cell division cycle 6 (CDC6) in regulating proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer. Clinically, lncRNA–CDC6 was highly expressed in tumor tissues and was positively correlated with clinical stages of breast cancers. Functionally, the ectopic expression of lncRNA–CDC6 promoted proliferation via regulation of G1 phase checkpoint, and further promoting the migration capability. Moreover, lncRNA–CDC6 could function as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) via directly sponging of microRNA-215 (miR-215), which further regulating the expression of CDC6. Taken together, our results proved that lncRNA–CDC6 could function as ceRNA and promote the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells, which provided a novel prognostic marker for breast cancers in clinic. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study was performed to determine if there was a difference in immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) rates between our public hospital and private cancer center, which share a common faculty with a consistent management philosophy in multidisciplinary care. We investigated the factors affecting postmastectomy reconstruction and IBR rates. Materials and methods: We retrospectively identified women with clinical stage I-II breast cancer who underwent mastectomy at our public hospital, Los Angeles County Medical Center, and our private cancer center, Keck Hospital of USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to study predictors of IBR and any breast reconstruction. Results: Of 293 mastectomy patients, the rate of any breast reconstruction at the private cancer (56.6%) center was higher than that at the public hospital (36.2%). IBR rates for the private cancer center (93.6%) and for patients with private insurance were higher than for the public hospital (40.8%) and likewise for those without insurance (86.7% versus 45.5%). In a multivariate analysis, the odds of IBR at our private cancer center were 22.96 times higher than that at our public hospital. Age >50 y and radiotherapy were independent predictive factors associated with less likelihood of any breast reconstruction. Conclusions: Patients at the public hospital had a much lower rate of breast reconstruction than the private cancer center patients, even after controlling for stage and the team of treating physicians. Our results showed that older age and radiotherapy affect rates of breast reconstruction, as do hospital system and insurance status. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer cells have intrinsic property to modulate their microenvironment and resist a wide array of stimuli including temperature disparity more efficiently than healthy cells by activating several homeostatic molecular mechanisms to sustain and prevent death. Although, oncogenic hyperthermia has been proved to induce anti-tumor effects in cancer cells through various regulatory mechanisms, the other critical molecular regulators are not studied in detail. Furthermore hypothermia is the far less studied conditions in cancer cell systems. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are primary heat response regulators. Several studies have reported key roles of HSP-90 in neoplasias. However, the role of HSP-70 transcripts in cancer cells during hypo and hyperthermic exposure remains understudied. Methods: In present study, the role of HSP-70 gene transcripts such as HSPA1A, HSPA4, HSPA8, HSPA9 and HSPA14 in two human breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 during direct exposure to hypo and hyperthermia (ranging from 33 °C to 42 °C) has been explored in time dependent manner. Results: Both the cancer cell lines showed significant changes in cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis post-hypo and hyperthermic exposure. Relative gene expression analysis showed significantly elevated expression of HSP-70 transcripts more specifically HSPA8 and HSPA14 post-hyperthermia exposure. Two different proliferative natures of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines showed significant variation in their transcripts expression suggesting that the HSP-70 genes expression may vary critically in normal and aggressive tumor environment. Conclusion: The present study indicates significance of HSPA8 and HSPA14 in regulating sustained behavior of cancer cells in cell and time dependent manner during hypo and hyperthermic exposure. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The novel method was developed for electrochemical cancer cell detection using CuO/WO 3 nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide nanosheet (CuO/WO 3 -GO) with enhanced peroxidase like-activity, based on catalytic reaction of H 2 O 2 with o-Phenylenediamine (OPD). The prepared nanocomposite conjugated with folic acid (FA), as a cancer cell-targeting ligand, and a miniaturized electrochemical cell for cancer cell detection was designed. In this strategy OPD could oxidize in the presence of H 2 O 2 on the surface of working electrode, which produced an electrochemical signal. However, the redox response signal changed by interaction of cells with FA/CuO/WO 3 -GO. During interaction between cells and CuO/WO 3 -GO, some amount of H 2 O 2 –OPD system participated in chemical reaction and removed from the electrode, resulting in a decrease in the response signal. As a consequence, cancer cells detected in wide detection range of 50 to 10 5 cells/mL and a detection limit of 18 cells/mL. Furthermore, the nanocomposite shows therapeutic cancer treatment through superior peroxidase activity. This work unveils an effective method for simple, sensitive and selective monitoring of cancer cells and also has the potential for efficient cancer therapy, which will open an avenue of nanozymes toward biological applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer, with unsatisfactory survival rates, is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Recent advances in the genetic basis of breast cancer have benefitted the development of gene-based medicines and therapies. Tissue engineering technologies, including tissue decellularizations and reconstructions, are potential therapeutic alternatives for cancer research and tissue regeneration. In our study, human breast cancer biopsies were decellularized by a detergent technique, with sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) solution, for the first time. And the decellularization process was optimized to maximally maintain tissue microarchitectures and extracellular matrix (ECM) components with minimal DNA compounds preserved. Histology analysis and DNA quantification results confirmed the decellularization effect with maximal genetic compounds removal. Quantification, immunofluorescence, and histology analyses demonstrated better preservation of ECM components in 0.5% SLES-treated scaffolds. Scaffolds seeded with MCF-7 cells demonstrated the process of cell recellularization in vitro, with increased cell migration, proliferation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. When treated with 5-fluorouracil, the expressions of stem cell markers, including Oct4, Sox2, and CD49F, were maximally maintained in the recellularized scaffold with decreased apoptosis rates compared with monolayer cells. These results showed that the decellularized breast scaffold model with SLES treatments would help to simulate the pathogenesis of breast cancer in vitro. And we hope that this model could further accelerate the development of effective therapies for breast cancer and benefit drug screenings. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women, and despite improved treatments, it remains a major challenge. However, improved mechanistic insight may lead to novel therapeutic strategies. miR-142-3p belongs to the miR-142 family and is involved in pathogenesis and metastasis of various types of malignancies by targeting several important messenger RNAs (mRNAs) including Bach-1. This is especially true for breast cancer, where Bach-1 is involved in the metastatic spread by deregulation of metastasis-associated genes. Methods: In this study, we collected 24 breast cancer tissues with 24 adjusted normal tissues to measure the expression levels of miR-142-3p and Bach-1 mRNA using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and IHC. miR-142-3p targeting of Bach-1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells was evaluated using bioinformatics, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. The cellular proliferation, invasion, and migration were assessed by MTT, transwell matrigel and wound healing assay and the EMT-associated proteins C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) were analyzed by western blot analysis. Also, the expression levels of tumor suppressors including miR-330, miR-145, and miR-34a were estimated by qRT-PCR. Results: Analysis of paired specimens of primary malignant and normal tissues showed that miR-142-3p was downregulated, while Bach-1 mRNA and protein both were overexpressed in the breast cancer tumors. This inverse relationship was confirmed by cell line experiments demonstrating that miR-142-3p expression reduced Bach-1 mRNA levels. Furthermore, replacement of miR-142-3p could inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration in breast cancer potentially by targeting of Bach-1 mRNA and subsequent inhibition of CXCR4, MMP9, and VEGFR protein expressions. In addition, induction of miR-142-3p could upregulate tumor suppressor miRNAs, including miR-330, miR-145, and miR34a. Conclusion: For the first time, our results revealed that miR-142-3p could target Bach-1in breast cancer cells leading to the reduction of EMT-related proteins and reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. The results also demonstrated that miR-142-3p could regulate important tumor suppressor miRNAs in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-142-3p could be a good candidate for the targeted therapy of breast cancer, especially for the invasive type. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Evidence is emerging that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in tumorigenesis. LncRNA gastric cancer-associated transcript 3 (GACAT3) is reported to participate in the development of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer. However, whether it is implicated in glioma has not been elucidated. Here, we found that GACAT3 level was aberrantly elevated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Higher GACAT3 expression predicted lower survival rate. Knockdown of GACAT3 suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion but promoting apoptosis in glioma cells. Next, we determined that GACAT3 contributes to glioma progression through inhibiting microRNA (miR)-3127-5p. Subsequently, ELAVL1 was identified as a direct target of miR-3127-5p by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, we confirmed that GACAT3 promoted ELAVL1 expression through sponging miR-3127-5p, leading to glioma progression. Taken together, our study elucidated that GACAT3/miR-3127-5p/ELAVL1 signaling regulates glioma development and might be a promising therapeutic target. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Few studies evaluated ICU readmission in cancer patients. This study aimed to describe the incidence and risk factors for ICU readmission in cancer patients and the association with mortality. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study at a comprehensive cancer center, which included cancer patients who were discharged after their initial ICU admission over a 5-year period. The characteristics and outcomes of patients who required ICU readmission within 30 days of discharge were compared to those who did not require readmission during the study period. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with readmission and to evaluate the association between readmission and mortality. Results: Among 1582 patients discharged from the ICU, 313(19.8%) were readmitted after a median of 6 days. The most common readmission diagnoses were respiratory failure and sepsis. Mechanical ventilation (OR 5.80; 95% CI 4.29–7.84) and thrombocytopenia (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.16–2.38), on the first ICU admission were associated with readmission. Readmission was associated with a higher risk of 28-day and 90-day mortality, (OR 3.02; CI 2.3–4.00) and (OR 3.47; 95% CI 2.69–4.49), respectively. Conclusions: ICU readmission was associated with increased mortality. Mechanical ventilation and thrombocytopenia at the first admission were associated with ICU readmission. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: Inflammation-based prognostic scores are associated with tumor recurrence and survival in various cancers. The aim of this study was to identify the significance of inflammation-based prognostic scores and to detect the most useful score in patients with distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods: Between 2000 and 2015, 121 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. The relationship between clinicopathological variables including various prognostic scores and disease-free (DFS) as well as overall (OS) survival was investigated by univariate analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to compare the predictive ability of each scoring system. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the clinicopathological variables associated. Results: In univariate analysis, Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), mGPS, C-reactive protein/Alb ratio score, prognostic index, and preoperative monocyte count were significant risk factors for both DFS and OS. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of GPS is consistently larger in comparison with other four scores in both DFS as well as OS. In multivariate analysis, GPS was an independent risk factor of both tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Conclusions: GPS score is an independent tumor recurrence and prognostic factor in patients with distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer and is superior to the other prognostic scores. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer therapeutics development has been a challenge due to their untoward side effects and cytotoxicity. Phytochemical anti-cancer drugs have several advantages over chemical chemotherapeutic drugs as they are less cytotoxic and have a greater pharmacological advantage. However, lack of targeting ability limits the use of phytochemicals at a great extent for a successful therapeutic strategy. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have long been used to load the therapeutic cargo and provided significant advantages over conventional chemo-therapeutics. In this present study, we report the synthesis and testing of various biosynthesized AuNPs (b-AuNPs) using naturally derived phytochemicals (Curcumin: Cur, Turmeric: Tur, Quercetin: Qu and Paclitaxel: Pacli). The synthesized b-AuNPs have been well characterized by different Physicochemical techniques. Cytotoxic potential of these b-AuNPs were evaluated in different breast cancer cells either in an individual or in a combination forms. We have observed the maximum therapeutic activity in a combination of all four types of b-AuNPs (AuNPs-Cur, AuNPs-Tur, AuNPs-Qu and AuNPs-Pacli) as compared to their pristine administration. Further, mechanistic studies of these compounds revealed that, combinations of AuNPs-Cur, AuNPs-Tur, AuNPs-Qu and AuNPs-Pacli were significantly effective in inhibiting cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, colony formation and spheroid formation predicting a synergistic effect when compared to individual treatment against different breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231). Interestingly the nanoconjugates alone or in combinations did not show cytotoxicity towards human embryonic normal kidney cell line (HEK 293), demonstrating the biocompatibility. Together the results demonstrated the potential anti-cancer properties of b-AuNPs in a combinatorial approach that could be the future of cancer nanomedicine. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This study has evaluated the effect of functionalizing surface charges of hydroxyapatite on the modulation of loading and release of curcumin nanoparticles. The increase in loading and release of curcumin nanoparticles indirectly translates to enhanced anti-cancer effect. Owing to the hydrophobic characteristics of curcumin which have resulted in low bioavailability in cancer cells, the engineering curcumin into nanoparticles is therefore a viable solution to overcomes its limitation. In order to maintain a sustained release profile of curcumin nanoparticles, curcumin nanoparticles were loaded (Cur-NPs) onto hydroxyapatite (HA) via physical adsorption. To regulate the adsorption capacity of Cur-NPs onto HA, we functionalized HA with different carboxylic acids (lactic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid). The presence of carboxylic groups on HA significantly affected the binding and the release profile of Cur-NPs. The effects of Cur-NPs loaded HA were evaluated on breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), which included cell proliferation, cellular uptake of Cur-NPs, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. The results showed that carboxylic acid-functionalized HA demonstrated higher anti-proliferating activity and time dependent cytoplasmic uptake of Cur-NPs in MCF-7 cells compared to unmodified HA. In addition, Cur-NPs loaded on functionalized HA induced higher apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells compared to unmodified HA. The present study indicates that the delivery of Cur-NPs to breast cancer using carboxylic acid-functionalized HA carrier could improve their anti-cancer activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: We sought to identify patterns of care for patients with appendiceal cancer and identify clinical factors associated with patient selection for multimodality treatment, including cytoreductive surgery and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/PIC). Materials and methods: National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 2004 to 2014 of all diagnoses of appendiceal cancers were examined. We examined treatment modalities, as well as demographic, tumor-specific, and survival data. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the patient cohort most likely to receive CRS/PIC. Kaplan–Meier was used to estimate survival for all treatment groups. Significance was evaluated at P ≤ 0.05. Results: We analyzed data on 18,055 patients. Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-two (55.3%) were treated with surgery only, 5848 (32.4%) received surgery and systemic chemotherapy, 1393 (7.71%) received CRS/PIC, 520 (2.88%) received chemotherapy alone, and 302 (1.67%) received neither surgery nor chemotherapy. Significant predictors of receiving CRS/PIC included male sex (OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.11-1.59), white race (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.40-2.86), non-Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.21-3.05), private insurance (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.26-1.84), and well-differentiated tumors (OR 4.25, CI: 3.39-5.32) (P < 0.05). Treatment with CRS/PIC was associated with a higher 5-year survival for mucinous malignancies, when compared to surgery alone (65.6% versus 62.4%, P < 0.01). Treatment with CRS/PIC was also associated with higher 5-year survival for well-differentiated malignancies, when compared to all other treatment modalities (74.9% versus 65.4%, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Patients were more likely to undergo CRS/PIC if they were male, white, privately insured, and with well-differentiated tumors. CRS/PIC was associated with improved survival in patients with mucinous and low-grade tumors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The present study investigated Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA genotyping in primary tumor, pelvic lymph nodes (PLN) and recurrence in early-stage cervical cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study. From 2003 to 2015, 282 patients underwent surgery for cervical cancer in the Department of Gynecology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. Twenty-nine recurrent cases were identified. HPV DNA genotyping was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from the primary tumor, PLN, and recurrent disease. Results: In the primary tumor, HPV DNA was detectable in 18(72%) of 25 tissue specimens from recurrent cases and in 15(83%) of 18 controls. HPV DNA-positive PLN was significantly associated with recurrence, 83%(95%CI: 52–98%), compared to patients with HPV-negative PLN, 38%(95%CI: 18–62%)(p < 0.05). HPV DNA genotyping was positive in eight of 12(67%) patients with recurrent disease. The genotype was identical in all three tissues types. The positive predictive value for recurrence was the same for detection of HPV-DNA and metastases in the PLN, with reasonable sensitivity. The negative predictive value for recurrence, however, was best for HPV-DNA, 62%(95%CI: 38–98%). Conclusions: In conclusion, our data suggest that the presence of HPV in pelvic lymph nodes is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Cigar smoking causes many of the same health conditions as cigarettes, but less information is available on prevalence of use trends and the disease burden of cigar smoking in the US. To examine these issues, we analyzed cigar use and health condition data from the National Health Interview Survey from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, estimating prevalence of use by year and over time. We also estimated the number of, and adjusted disease prevalence ratios for, US adults aged ≥35 years with self-reported history of heart disease, stroke, or cancer attributable to cigar smoking. We found that prevalence of current cigar smoking has remained generally stable at around 2.3% among US adults aged ≥18 years between 2000 and 2015 but has increased among female and non-Hispanic black adults. Former exclusive cigar smokers were more likely to report having had heart conditions (aPR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03–1.72), stroke (aPR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.57–3.75), and cancer (aPR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.09–1.88) than never cigar smokers. It is estimated that nearly 200,000 cardiovascular conditions and cancer cases among US adults are attributable to former exclusive cigar smoking. This analysis shows that prevalence of current cigar smoking has remained stable among US adults but has increased among certain demographic groups. Former exclusive cigar use is associated with increased prevalence of heart disease, stroke, and cancer, which may result in part from smoking cessation following disease onset. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "As one of the most aggressive malignancies, cervical cancer (CC) which mainly affects females has high risks of relapse and death. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-552M11.4 is verified to promote the progression of ovarian cancer; nevertheless, its role and the probable molecular mechanisms in CC remain unclear until the present study. Herein, we unveiled that the expression of lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 tested by qRT-PCR was enhanced in tumor tissues compared with the para-carcinoma tissues and related to FIGO Stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and distant metastasis in CC. Additionally, CC patients with high lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 level suffered from poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, silenced lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 restrained cell proliferation, migration and invasion in CC cells. Subsequently, the mechanistic studies revealed that lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 functioned as a ceRNA of ATF1 in CC by acting as the endogenous sponge for miR-3941, which was identified as a tumor suppressor in CC. Moreover, both miR-3941 inhibition and ATF1 overexpression restored the impacts of inhibited lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 on cellular processes in CC cells. Our observations elucidated the carcinogenic role of lncRNA RP11-552M11.4 in CC was mediated through miR-3941/ATF1 axis, giving a new insight into the effective target for the treatment and prognosis of cervical cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third-leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. HACE1 function as a tumor-suppressor gene and is downregulated in several kinds of cancers. However, the distribution and clinical significance of HACE1 in CRC is still not clarified. In this study, we found that the HACE1 expression is greatly downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, the HACE1 expression was significantly associated with inhibition of CRC cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion. HACE1 inhibited epithelial–mesenchymal transition in CRC cells. Furthermore, we found that HACE1 altered the protein expression of the Hippo pathway by downregulation of YAP1. HACE1 suppresses the invasive ability of CRC cells by negatively regulating the YAP1 pathway. Our data indicates that HACE1 directly targets YAP1 and induces downregulation of YAP1, thereby increasing the activity of the Hippo pathway. In summary, these findings demonstrated that HACE1–YAP1 axis had an important part in the CRC development and progression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "ZC3H13 is a canonical CCCH zinc finger protein, which harbors a somatic frame-shift mutation in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, its expression and biological function were still uncertain. In the current study, we found that ZC3H13 was served as a tumor suppressor in CRC cells, which decreased the expression of Snail, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E1, and increased the expression of Occludin and Zo-1 through inactivating Ras–ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, reduction of ZC3H13 associated with advanced TNM stage (p = 0.02), positive regional lymph node metastasis (p = 0.01). Taken together, the current study indicated that ZC3H13 may be an upstream regulator of Ras–ERK signaling pathway and suppressed invasion and proliferation of CRC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Many observational studies have reported an association between vitamin D and non-skeletal health outcomes. The D-Health Trial was launched to determine if supplementing the older population with high monthly doses of Vitamin D can prevent cancer and premature mortality. The intervention is ongoing but here we provide a detailed statistical analysis plan for the primary and secondary outcomes of the D-Health Trial. Methods/design: The D-Health Trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Between February 2014 and May 2015, 21,315 people were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive monthly doses of either 60,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3 ) or placebo for five years. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality and the secondary outcomes are total cancer incidence and colorectal cancer incidence. These will be ascertained via linkage to death and cancer registries. The primary analysis for each outcome will follow an intention-to-treat approach; we will use flexible parametric survival models to investigate the association between supplementation and time to an event. We describe in detail sophisticated secondary analyses that consider non-compliance and contamination due to off-study supplementation. Conclusions: Publication of this statistical analysis plan in advance of the intervention's completion, and adherence to it, will avoid data-driven analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes and ensure robust reporting of outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a disease of glucose metabolism, and it adversely affects bone metabolism and increases the risk of cancer development. Previously, we reported a method for the direct isolation of human mature osteoblasts and indicated that osteoblasts were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus-related signaling pathways. In addition, a recent report suggested that osteoblasts are involved in glucose metabolism. Thus, we sought to examine the effects of diabetes on osteoblast signaling in vivo. We recruited eight patients with type 2 diabetes and eight non-diabetic individuals. We isolated human mature osteoblasts from the resected femoral heads during orthopaedic surgery and extracted their RNA. We compared the gene expression between the two groups by RNA microarray and pathway analyses. Microarray analysis showed significant differences in 885 of 19,463 genes between the two groups (p < 0.05), and pathway analysis revealed that pathways related to cancer and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway were significantly activated in the diabetes group (p < 0.01). These preliminary findings suggest that diabetes affects intracellular signaling in human mature osteoblasts and that osteoblasts might not only play a key role in the regulation of bone and glucose metabolism, but might also be related to cancer metabolism. We plan to conduct further studies to examine signaling in diabetic osteoblasts and to further investigate the genes and pathways identified here. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Minimally invasive surgeries are increasingly being performed for primary colon cancer resections since laparoscopic and robotic surgeries have less post-operative pain, shorter length of hospitalization, less morbidity, improved patient satisfaction and equivalent R0 resection rates compared to laparotomy. Methods: To analyze characteristics of patients who developed port site metastases after minimally invasive colectomy, a retrospective case series of a single institution from 2004 to 2017 was performed. The study included patients who had a minimally invasive resection of the primary colon cancer and subsequent cytoreduction and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) for peritoneal metastases. Patient characteristics, histology, pathology, prior treatments, time between surgeries, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and survival were reviewed. Results: There were 123 patients who had CRS/HIPEC and 13 of them had a history of laparoscopic or robotic colectomy followed by the development of port site disease. Four were females, nine were males. Median age was 48 years (range, 19–64). Eleven of 13 primary colon cancers were T3 or T4. Ten of 13 patients had no clinical evidence of peritoneal metastases at the time of initial resection. All 13 patients had metastatic deposits at port sites that were confirmed histopathologically at the time of CRS/HIPEC. Conclusions: Port site metastases were present concomitantly with peritoneal metastases in 13 patients. An advanced T-stage of disease occurred in 85% of patients. Port site metastases do occur after minimally invasive colon resection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Resistin, secreted by macrophages in tumor microenvironment, has never been investigated in pancreatic cancer models, despite a vibrant tumor microenvironment around pancreatic tumors. We evaluated serum resistin levels in healthy individuals versus pancreatic cancer patients representing different tumor grades. In vitro mechanistic analysis involved MiaPaCa-2 and SW1990 cells. Resistin signaling depends on binding of resistin to its cognitive receptors. Therefore, we silenced adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), its two known receptors, individually as well as in combination, by short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Effect of resistin on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and sensitivity to gemcitabine was studied without or with silencing of resistin receptors CAP1 and/or TLR4. The results were also confirmed in vivo in mice xenografted with MiaPaCa-2 cells without or with receptor silencing. We report high resistin levels in pancreatic cancer patients which correlate positively with tumor grades. We observed a marked reduction in the resistin-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2 and SW1990 when the receptors were silenced. The results were confirmed in vivo wherein resistin effects were significantly attenuated in MiaPaCa-2 xenografts with silenced receptors. The combined silencing of CAP1 and TLR4 was found to be most effective in vitro and in vivo. We found activation of STAT3 by resistin in vivo and in vitro which was dependent on the presence of CAP1 and TLR4. Further, resistin was found to induce resistance to gemcitabine through its receptors. Our results describe novel functional roles of resistin with implications toward a better understanding of pancreatic tumor microenvironment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) is the most common type of cancer and the second cause of death worldwide in men and women after cardiovascular diseases. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent type of LC occurring in 85% of cases. Developing new methods for early detection of NSCLC could substantially increase the chances of survival and, therefore, is an urgent task for current research. Nowadays, explosion in nanotechnology offers unprecedented opportunities for therapeutics and diagnosis applications. In this context, exploiting the bio-nano-interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and biological fluids is an emerging field of research. Upon contact with biofluids, NPs are covered by a biomolecular coating referred to as “biomolecular corona” (BC). In this study, we exploited BC for discriminating between NSCLC patients and healthy volunteers. Blood samples from 10 NSCLC patients and 5 subjects without malignancy were allowed to interact with negatively charged lipid NPs, leading to the formation of a BC at the NP surface. After isolation, BCs were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). We found that the BCs of NSCLC patients was significantly different from that of healthy individuals. Statistical analysis of SDS-PAGE results allowed discriminating between NSCLC cancer patients and healthy subjects with 80% specificity, 80% sensitivity and a total discriminate correctness rate of 80%. While the results of the present investigation cannot be conclusive due to the small size of the data set, we have shown that exploitation of the BC is a promising approach for the early diagnosis of NSCLC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV)16 can be separated into genetic sub-lineages (A1–4, B1–4, C1–4, D1–4) which may have differential cervical cancer risk. Methods: A next-generation sequencing assay was used to whole-genome sequence 7116 HPV16-positive cervical samples from well-characterised international epidemiological studies, including 2076 controls, 1878 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 186 adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous cell carcinoma (ADC), and to assign HPV16 sub-lineage. Logistic regression was used to estimate region-stratified country-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95%CI. Results: A1 was the most globally widespread sub-lineage, with others showing stronger regional specificity (A3 and A4 for East Asia, B1–4 and C1–4 for Africa, D2 for the Americas, B4, C4 and D4 for North Africa). Increased cancer risks versus A1 were seen for A3, A4 and D (sub)lineages in regions where they were common: A3 in East Asia (OR=2.2, 95%CI:1.0–4.7); A4 in East Asia (6.6, 3.1–14.1) and North America (3.8, 1.7–8.3); and D in North (6.2, 4.1–9.3) and South/Central America (2.2, 0.8–5.7), where D lineages were also more frequent in ADC than SCC (3.2, 1.5–6.5; 12.1, 5.7–25.6, respectively). Conclusions: HPV16 genetic variation can strongly influence cervical cancer risk. However, burden of cervical cancer attributable to different sub-lineages worldwide is largely driven by historical HPV16 sub-lineage dispersal. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Circular RNAs were recently identified as a novel type of noncoding RNAs. An increasing number of reports have demonstrated their essential regulatory roles in various biological processes and human diseases, including cancer. However, the role of circRNA in cervical cancer (CC) remains largely unknown. In the current study, we investigated the physiological functions of circ_0067934 during CC development and progression. We found that circ_0067934 was overexpressed in CC tissues and cell lines. Circ_0067934 upregulation was associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in CC patients. Knockdown of circ_0067934 suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of CC cells in vitro. Circ_0067934 loss also inhibited CC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, silencing circ_0067934 increased miR-545 expression. MiR-545 repressed EIF3C expression through targeting its 3′-untranslated region. MiR-545 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells, whereas restoration of EIF3C could rescue the effects of circ_0067934 knockdown. Taken together, our findings revealed that circ_0067934 promotes CC progression via miR-545/EIF3C axis. Our study may provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of CC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Nanotechnology-based bitherapy has recently emerged as an effective strategy to overcome biomedical barriers against successful anticancer therapy. The study aimed to evaluate lipid nanocarriers loaded with tamoxifen citrate/coenzyme Q10 (TC/CoQ10) as bitherapy for selective targeting of breast cancer. Based on a previous study, four formulations of lipid nanocarriers were selected for in-vitro cell viability estimation using both MCF-7 and normal WISH cell lines. Oxidative status, cytopathological changes, and genetoxicity were also investigated. The results showed 100% mortality for tested cells without selectivity even at very low concentration for free drugs. On the other hand lipid nanocarriers revealed an increase in % cell viability for normal WISH cell line reaching 100% at 0.25 μg/ml. The lipid nanocarrier formulated from stearic acid and lecithin showed LC 50 on MCF-7 cell line (1.6 μg/ml) compared to (4.8 μg/ml) on WISH cell line. The cell death pathway for unformulated bitherapy depended on necrosis rather than apoptosis. The Malondialdehyde concentration was decreased, while Glutathione level increased to near normal values in both MCF-7 and WISH cells. The results demonstrated a promising synergistic and selective action of TC/CoQ10 bitherapy on breast cancer cells when administered in lipid nanocarriers delivery system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Data from 423 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−), hormone receptor-positive (HR+) advanced breast cancer (aBC) patients treated with palbociclib and endocrine therapy (ET) were provided by 35 Italian cancer centers and analyzed for treatment outcomes. Overall, 158 patients were treated in first line and 265 in second/later lines. We observed 19 complete responses and 112 partial responses. The overall response rate (ORR) was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.6–35.4) and clinical benefit was 52.7% (95% CI, 48–57.5). ORR was negatively affected by prior exposure to everolimus/exemestane (p = 0.002) and favorably influenced by early line-treatment (p < 0.0001). At 6 months, median progression-free survival was 12 months (95% CI, 8–16) and median overall survival was 24 months (95% CI, 17–30). More favorable outcomes were associated with palbociclib in early lines, no visceral metastases and no prior everolimus/exemestane. The main toxicity reported was neutropenia. Our results provide further support to the use of palbociclib with ET in HER2−, HR+ aBC. Differences in outcomes across patients subsets remain largely unexplained. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Potential anti-cancer drugs are frequently of low efficacy in clinics due to the lack of predictive models or the insufficient employment of existing preclinical test systems. Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro engineered tumor models can better predict the efficacy of novel drugs by reproducing the in vivo tumor microenvironment. In this study, three sources of scaffolds (decellularized lung scaffold, chitosan/gelatin scaffold, and poly-L-lactic acid scaffold) incorporated with breast cancer cells (MCF-7, 4T1) were bioengineered as a platform to study in vitro solid tumor development. The good biocompatibility of three scaffolds favored cell growth and proliferation. Cells in 3D scaffolds were less sensitive to chemotherapy and exhibited characteristics of higher malignancy compared to their 2D counterparts. The expression of breast cancer biomarkers in MCF-7 cells markedly up-regulated in 3D scaffolds in comparison with those in 2D cultures. Cells grown in 3D scaffolds were found to be more tumorigenic and angiogenic in BABL/c mice xenografts than cells grown from monolayers. The results demonstrate that 3D engineered tumor model can better mimic in vivo tumor and can serve as a more appropriate platform for the study and screening of novel cancer therapeutics. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this article, a new approach to directly synthesize drug molecule imbedded in the nanometer sized polymer particles is reported. Molecular imprinting is used to prepare polymers for drug specific for selectively loading of a desired drug. Computer simulations were performed to provide mechanistic insights on the binding modalities of model cancer drug, amygdalin with the polymer precursors. Controlled release of amygdalin from nanoMIPs was studied in vitro cell test and monitoring the absorbance at λ em of 390 nm by fluorescence. The nanoparticles imprinted with amygdalin (nanoMIPs) showed high drug loading (0.98 mg g −1 ) and also releases drug in a controlled way without burst release. The polymer releases amygdalin 0.095 μg (5 min), 0.120 μg (30 min), 0.180 μg (180 min), 0.205 μg in 300 min in de-ionized water and similar pattern of release was observed in buffer 2 and 7. The sustained release of drug from nanoMIPs follows Fickian diffusion; and uniformity in nanoMIPs size have significant impact on release of drug. Swelling of nanoMIP is one of the dominant factors influencing the drug release patterns. The imprinting procedure and the studies reported in this study would be highly useful in future for cancer drug administration. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, we have determined the prognostic value and observed the clinicopathological features of brainstem glioma. Overall, we found more number of male patients with brainstem glioma (male:female ratio: 1:6). All patients were subjected to surgery followed by chemotherapy. The tumor was mainly located at brainstem and thalamus. We have recorded the symptoms associated with onset of lesions and predominated by headache, vomiting and limb weakness. We observed the overall survival pattern in brain stem glioma cases and further among low and high grade subgroups. Patients with high grade brainstem glioma were recorded with the median survival of 15 months. There was a statistically significant difference in the survival pattern of low grade vs high grade group (p = 0.015, hazard ratio: 0.29, 95% CI of ratio: 0.058 to 0.71) Taken together, the clinical presentation provides valuable information to enhance the therapeutic measures for the brainstem glioma cases. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The rapid identification of living cancer cells is highly crucial for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. However, it is a great challenge to develop an effective way for rapid identification and imaging of cancer cells in a living state. Moreover, synthesis of monodisperse nanoparticles (NPs) with high sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity is also a tough work. Herein, we creatively reported a convenient method to synthesize the novel NPs as the substrate of SERS sensors, which possessed a gold nanobipyramid core and silver nanorod shell. These gold nanobipyramid core and silver nanorod shell NPs (Au NBP@Ag NRs) were further modified with 4-mercaptobenzoicacid (4-MBA, Raman reporter molecule) and then conjugated with reduced bovine serum albumin (rBSA) and folic acid (FA) on their surfaces, to finally acquire Au NBP@Ag NR-MBA-rBSA-FA nanoprobes. In this system, With the enhancement factor (EF) of Au NBP@Ag NRs was about 4 × 10 7 , it could significantly enhance Raman signal for Raman reporter molecules, and 4-MBA molecules performed high SERS signals based on their structures; the nanoprobes have favorable specificity and biocompatibility owing to the modification of rBSA which effectively avoided the nonspecific attachment of non-targeted cells. Moreover, the obtained SERS nanoprobes have excellent sensitivity for gastric cancer cells (MGC-803 cells) due to the conjugation of folic acid. Thus, the finally obtained Au NBP@Ag NR-MBA-rBSA-FA nanoprobes possess excellent detection efficiency for living MGC-803 cells. Therefore, our synthesized nanoprobes exhibit ultrasensitive SERS-activity, excellent specificity and superior cancer cells targeting ability, which could be applied for rapid identification and Raman imaging of living cancer cells via the SERS signal detection of the nanoprobes. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "KRAS G12D point mutation plays an important role in the incidence of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer. Here, we developed a novel anchor-like DNA (alDNA) electrochemical sensor for the detection of KRAS point mutation level (the concentration ratio of the specific KRAS point mutant DNA (M-DNA) to the total DNA (t-DNA) of both mutant and wild-type DNAs carrying the same allele). Compared to those conventional ligation-based DNA sensors, the proposed alDNA sensor achieved the one-step capture of both wild-type and mutant DNA, and the subsequent detection on one chip, which effectively decreased systematic errors from the uncertain differences on the interfacial structural and microenvironmental changes, improved the detection accuracy. Also, with the usage of formamide-NaCl solution, the whole detection process including the denaturation of double-stranded DNA was performed under mild temperature conditions (~40 °C). It greatly decreased the cost and improved the reproducibility and feasibility of the method. Based on it, the linear correlations with the logarithm of concentration in wide range from 0.1 pM to 10 nM for t-DNA and from 100 pM to 10 nM for M-DNA were achieved, respectively. The analysis of t-DNA- and M-DNA-spiked human serum samples revealed the high accuracy of the method. This alDNA sensor is convenient, low-cost and time-saving, with broad dynamic range, high sensitivity and selectivity. It can meet the demands of the clinical detection on the KRAS point mutation level in blood samples, which means significant for the earlier NSCLC diagnosis, individualized treatment, and therapeutic efficacy evaluation. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Short interfering RNA (siRNA) showed to be a viable alternative to a better prognosis in cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the successful application of this strategy still depends on the development of nanocarriers for the safe delivery of siRNA into the diseased tissue, which mostly occurs by passive accumulation. When an external magnetic field is applied, magnetic nanoparticles biodistribution is partially modulated to favor accumulation in a target tissue. In this work we designed a novel magnetic responsive siRNA nanocarrier. The new delivery system is composed of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with calcium phosphate (CaP) and PEG-polyanion block copolymers, which are known to be biocompatible. The nanoparticles presented rounded shape with small size and narrow distribution suitable for biomedical applications. TEM images showed dark spheres in the core surrounded by a lower electron density material in the corona. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) confirmed CaP-polymer coating of the magnetic core. In addition, the coating procedure did not affect the superparamagnetic property as showed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). With a high loading efficiency (80%), the nanoparticles enhanced vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) silencing in breast cancer cells in vitro, at gene and protein levels (~60% and 40%, respectively), without associated toxicity. Iron and siRNA quantification showed that the novel nanoparticles move towards a magnetic source carrying siRNA molecules. Therefore, these novel nanoparticles are a promising tool for cancer therapy based on RNAi effect, added by a magnetic capability to further modulate siRNA accumulation in the target tissue. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: There is a paucity of studies reporting long-term survival outcomes for HPV/p16 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). This study aims to compare long-term outcomes of advanced stage p16 positive and negative OPSCCs, treated by surgical and non-surgical modalities. Methods: OPSCC patients from 1998 to 2012 were identified through a prospectively collected cancer registry. P16 immunohistochemistry was used as a surrogate marker for HPV-OPSCC. Overall survival (OS) and aspiration free survival (AFS) comparisons were made between patients treated with chemoradiation (CRT) versus primary surgery and radiation/chemoradiation (S+RT/CRT) at 5, 10 and 15 years post-treatment. Results: A total of 319 patients were included. P16 positive patients and non-smokers had significantly higher long-term (5, 10 and 15-year) OS. Smokers and p16 negative patients treated with S+RT/CRT had improved long-term OS compared to patients who received CRT. Smokers and p16 negative patients had lower long-term AFS. Multivariate analysis showed improved OS was associated with p16 positivity (HR 0.42, 0.28–0.61) and surgery (HR 0.47, 0.32–0.69), whereas lower OS was associated with ECOG ≥ 2 (HR 2.46, 1.61–3.77), smoking (HR 2.37, 1.41–3.99) and higher stage (HR 1.68, 1.05–2.68). Conclusions: In smokers and p16-negative OPSCC patients, primary surgery may be associated with improved long-term survival and dysphagia-related outcomes. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered to be the third most common cancer worldwide, and it is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths. CRC is described as multifactorial disease. Among others, Glutathione S-transferases are known to act pro-carcinogenic in CRCs, however, they are needed for the conjugation between chemotherapeutics and a wide spectrum of xenobiotics. In this study, 70 patients with CRC and 85 healthy volunteers without any cancer history were genotyped. Polymorphism genotypes for the genes GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTM1 were studied by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and/or multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Our finding showed a significant risk for CRC associated with GSTP1 heterozygous Ile/Val (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 0.93–3.44; p = 0.009), while GSTP1 Val/Val homozygous was observed only in the CRC patients. Significant differences in the frequency of GSTM1- and GSTT1-null genotypes were found. The GSTT1-null genotype was higher in CRC group (34.3%) than in control group (12.9%) (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.57–7.83; p = 0.001). The GSTM1-null was higher in CRC cases (42.8%) compared with control group (21.1%) (OR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.38–5.64; p = 0.003). Individuals carrying combined, both GSTM1/GSTT1-null genotype, were associated with an estimated 7.56-fold higher risk to form CRC than those having GSTM1/GSTT1-present genotype. Individuals carrying combined three genotypes of GSTM1-null/GSTT1-null/ heterozygous Ile/Val genotype for GSTP1 were associated with an estimated 21.63-fold higher risk to be CRC than those carrying GSTM1-present/GSTT1-present/ Ile/Ile genotype of the GSTP1 (OR = 21.63; 95% CI: 2.39–195.82; p = 0.001). Also, individuals with combined three genotypes of GSTM1-null/GSTT1-present/ heterozygous Ile/Val genotype for GSTP1 were associated with an estimated 13.9-fold higher risk to be CRC than those carrying GSTM1-present/GSTT1-present/ Ile/Ile genotype of the GSTP1 (OR = 13.9; 95% CI: 2.60–74.35; p = 0.0007). Overall, the results of this pilot study in 70 patients revealed that the GSTM1-null genotype, alone or in combination with GSTT1-null genotype, GSTP1-heterozygous is associated with enhanced risk for CRC in Syrian population. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of epithelial breast malignancy, and chemoresistance is the major obstacle for cancer therapy. TNBC is associated with a hypoxic phenotype, and hypoxia contributes to the chemoresistance in breast cancer. Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tDRs) represent a new class of small noncoding RNAs that can be induced specifically by hypoxia. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of the aberrant expression of tDRs in hypoxia-treated TNBC cell lines through the use of high-throughput sequencing technique. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the differently expressed tDRs between two samples. The results showed that tDR-0009 [derived from transfer RNA (tRNA) Gly-GCC-1-1 ] and tDR-7336 (derived from tRNA Gly-GCC-1–2 ) were significantly upregulated when the SUM-1315 cell lines were stimulated by hypoxia. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis indicated that these two upregulated tDRs were mainly involved in maintenance of stem cell population and cellular response to interleukin (IL)-6, which may be the underlying mechanism of hypoxia-induced tDRs that facilitate the doxorubicin resistance in TNBC. The protein–protein interaction network for predicted target genes established by the STRING database manifested that tDR-0009 (tDR-7336) might be involved in the chemoresistance of TNBC via regulation of the activation of phosphorylation of STAT3. In summary, our study provided a comprehensive analysis of the deviant expression profiling of tDRs in hypoxia-treated TNBC cell lines. Specific tDRs may be a new class of regulatory factors involved in the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in TNBC, and they could serve as potential biomarkers and intervention targets. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "With the objective of finding an avenue for development of magnetic nanomaterials which were incorporated into cells for induction of cell death in human cancerous cell lines, an environmental friendly synthesis method was investigated. The present work aimed to synthesis magnetic NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO nanoparticles by a novel, simple, environmental friendly and cost effective method in the presence of Dactylopius Coccus. The ultra-fine NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO ceramic nanocomposites (NNC) were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) as well as vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) used to study the magnetic properties of NNC nanoparticles. MTT cytotoxicity assay performed to determine the anti-proliferative effect of NNC nanoparticles against 4T1 breast cancer cell lines. The results demonstrated that the NNC nanoparticles meaningfully reduced the survival percentage of the 4T1 cells of the murine invasive breast cancer with an IC 50 was of 4 mg/ml. The dominant mechanism of cell death was apoptosis, along with an increase in cellular oxidative stress. Consequently, based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO nanoparticles can potentially be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The authors present the case of a patient who after undergoing craniotomy for glioblastoma resection was found to have gliosarcoma recurrence in the subdural space without intraparenchymal recurrence. A 74-year old man originally presented with the first seizure of his life and was found to have a right temporal glioblastoma multiforme. He underwent craniotomy and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Five months later, he presented with what was to be presumed to be a right subdural hematoma found on surveillance imaging. After expanding on repeat imaging, the patient was electively taken for burr hole evacuation, however intraoperatively thickened membranes were encountered leading to craniotomy and resection of lesion with pathology consistent with gliosarcoma. What we describe is novel because not only was there rare subdural spread of previously resected glioblastoma observed, but also transformation to the more aggressive tumor of gliosarcoma. Thus, we add to the body of literature and evidence to the clinical consideration of glioma as a rare cause of non-traumatic subdural collection. Specifically in a population of patients who have already undergone glioma resections, work up of subdural collections should include contrasted MRI beyond CT. The treatment paradigm does not change in this presentation of glioma recurrence. Surgical decompression and resection to alleviate brain compression, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Conventional laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy procedures have inherent limitations such as restricted movement of straight forceps and tremor of the tip of the devices that can potentially be overcome using robotic distal gastrectomy (RDG). This single-institutional phase II trial aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of RDG with lymph node dissection for clinical stage IA gastric cancer. Methods: The study included patients with clinical stage IA gastric cancer in the lower two-thirds of the stomach considered to be curatively resected via distal gastrectomy. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who developed intra-abdominal complications, requiring medical or interventional treatment. The planned sample size was 25, calculated based on an expected complication rate of 3% and a threshold complication rate of 15%, with a one-sided alpha of 10%, power of 70%. Results: Overall postoperative complications rate was 16%. The proportion of patients who developed intra-abdominal complications, requiring treatment was 0% (90% confidence interval, 0–9.8%). No patient developed in-hospital adverse events of grade 3 or higher. The short-term clinical outcomes were as follows: the median duration of postoperative hospital stay was 7 d, and 10 patients (40.0%) had a body temperature of 38°C or higher during their hospital stay. Conclusions: This trial confirmed the safety of RDG with limitation by the restriction of dedicated surgeons. A phase III trial to confirm the superiority of RDG to conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is warranted. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The use of laparoscopy in the treatment and management of advanced ovarian cancer is increasing among the gynaecologic oncologists. The development of port site metastases after laparoscopy is a concern and a matter of debate due to theoretical iatrogenic disease spread. Port site resection (PSR) has been proposed as an option to avoid this scenario. Material and methods: One hundred and twenty-three patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO III-IV) and with diagnostic laparoscopy were included and after cytoreductive surgery were classified into two groups: no port site resection (No-PSR) and port site resection (PSR). Based on the pathological results of all port site specimens, PSR was classified as positive port site metastasis (PSM+) and negative port site metastasis (PSM-). Results: In 82 cases, the laparoscopic port site access was resected in the debulking surgery. At the final specimen examination, 49% presented as PSM+. No statistical differences regarding survival were found, either between the No-PSR and PSR groups (p = 0.28) or between the PSM+ and PSM - groups (p = 0.92). A higher wound complication rate was found in the PSR group (17% vs. 34%; p = 0.047). The RR (Relative Risk) of wound events for PSR was 2.42 (95% CI 1.09–5.35; p = 0.0296). Conclusions: To date, not only there is no data supporting PSR after laparoscopy in advanced ovarian cancer, but the role of PSM+ in prognosis also remains unclear. In patients in which laparoscopy is performed prior to the debulking procedure, the PSR may not be recommended in those cases of no macroscopic port site metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Our study was aimed to investigate the effect of cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (CASC2) on the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods: CASC2 expression in tumor tissues and HCC cells was tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. After manipulating the expression of CASC2 in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, cells viability, including proliferation, apoptosis, cell-cycle distribution, migration, and invasion were examined by colony formation assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing assay, and transwell assay, respectively. The expression levels of proteins associated with the cell cycle and AKT/mTOR pathway were measured by the western blot. Stably transfected HepG2 cells were used to construct nude mice models, and tumorigenesis was evaluated to investigate the in vivo functions of CASC2 in HCC progression. Results: In tissues and cells of HCC, decreased CASC2 expressions were confirmed. Overexpression of CASC2 made cell cycle stagnated at G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, the overexpression of CASC2 played significant roles in inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, In vivo experiment indicated that CASC2 restrained the growth of tumors. Conclusion: Our study suggested that CASC2 promoted cell apoptosis and suppressed cell growth and metastasis in HCC, indicating that CASC2 might be a useful biomarker of HCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue is a common cancer of the oral region, generally occurring on the lateral surface of the tongue. Case report: We present a case of SCC of the dorsum of the tongue along with the development of two other primary cancers with different histologies in a 61-year-old Japanese woman, who presented with a mass on the dorsum of her tongue in 2017. Intraoral examination revealed a 2.5 × 1.5-cm tumor on the dorsum of the tongue without induration and covered with normal epithelium. She was previously diagnosed with carcinoma in an adenoma of the duodenum in 2013 and adenocarcinoma of the right lung in 2016. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no evidence of malignant tumors in the head and neck region. The lesion of the tongue was surgically excised with a safe margin. Histological examination revealed well-differentiated SCCs that were completely excised. Discussion: This is a rare case of three primary cancers with different histologies in one patient. Clinicians should consider SCC of the dorsum of the tongue during diagnosis, since it is a rare region and the tumor may mimic benign tumors. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Although platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard-of-care for most patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), acquired resistance occurs frequently predicting poor prognosis. To examine the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance, we have generated and characterized by proteomic approach the resistant A549 CDDP-resistant (CPr-A549) and their parental A549 cells, identifying 15 proteins differentially expressed (13 upregulated and 2 downregulated in CPr-A549). In details, we highlighted a coherent network of proteins clustering together and involved in altered protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum stress, correlated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition process and cancer stem cell markers, where vimentin played a hierarchical role, ultimately resulting in increased aggressive features. By using publicly available databases we showed that the modulated proteins could contribute to NSCLC carcinogenesis and correlate with NSCLC patients prognosis and survival probability, suggesting that they can be used as novel potential prognostic/predictive biomarkers or therapeutic targets to overcome platinum-resistance. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major public health problem and research using cell culture models has improved understanding of this disease. The human cervix contains three anatomic regions; ectocervix with stratified squamous epithelium, endocervix with secretory epithelium, and transformation zone (TZ) with metaplastic cells. Most cervical cancers originate within the TZ. However, little is known about the biology of TZ cells or why they are highly susceptible to carcinogenesis. The goal of this study was to develop and optimize methods to compare growth and differentiation of cells cultured from ectocervix, TZ or endocervix. We examined the effects of different serum-free media on cell attachment, cell growth and differentiation, and cell population doublings in monolayer culture. We also optimized conditions for organotypic culture of cervical epithelial cells using collagen rafts with human cervical stromal cells. Finally, we present a step-by-step protocol for culturing cells from each region of human cervix. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Applications of fibrous meshes for localized chemotherapy have been limited by the lack of optimal carriers that are capable of releasing sufficient drug locally. To overcome this obstacle, we introduced Pluronic F127 (PF127) to the camptothecin (CPT)-loaded poly(lactic acid/glycolic acid) (PLGA) electrospun fibrous meshes, abbreviated as PPC, for modulation of drug release. These PPC meshes had smooth surface and high drug loading (5.6–6.8%). Addition of PF127 obviously improved the hydrophilicity of the meshes. Interestingly, the CPT release rate of PPC meshes was significantly higher than that of CPT-loaded PLGA (PLGA-CPT) meshes. Most importantly, incorporation of PF127 in the meshes led to significant reduction in the CT-26 viability compared to PLGA-CPT mesh. The improved anticancer effects of PPC meshes were mainly due to the induction of apoptosis in CT-26 cells. These findings suggest that PPC mesh could be a promising implantable system that may enhance the therapeutic efficacy and prevent tumor recurrence after surgical resection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, an HER2 aptamer-decorated curcumin-loaded human serum albumin nanoparticle (Apt-HSA/CCM NP) was developed and characterized as a new anticancer formulation for targeted delivery to human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing breast cancer cells. Conjugation of HER2 Apt to the surface of HSA NPs was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and FTIR analysis. The obtained NPs have the hydrodynamic diameter of 281.1 ± 11.1 nm and zeta potential of −33.3 ± 2.5 mV. The data demonstrated that encapsulation of curcumin in HSA NPs by desolvation method has increased water solubility by 400 folds. Fluorescent microscopy image demonstrated remarkable cytoplasmic uptake of Apt-HSA/CCM NPs in HER2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells compared to unconjugated counterparts. Cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated no significant difference between cytotoxic effect of free curcumin and non-targeted HSA/CCM NPs in both HER2 positive and HER2 negative cell lines. However, the toxicity of Apt-HSA/CCM NPs was significantly higher and cell viability reached 36% after 72 h in SK-BR3 cell line. These results suggest that this targeted delivery system has the potential to be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of HER2 positive cancer cells. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is one of the most concerned diseases in the world, where there is still no reported specifically targeted drugs with high effect. In this study, mesoporous silica with a large pore size of 25.25 nm and magnetic cores was prepared as a carrier of doxorubicin for anti-cancer drug delivery. Besides its superior biocompatibility properties and functional surface, the large mesopores provided enough space for multiple chemical modification and in-situ growth of Au nanoparticles. Amino groups were grafted on the inner mesopores to capture the drug molecules via complexation. Cooperated with the steric hindrance of β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the external surface, a perfect response to acid environment was established. Meanwhile, the presence of magnetic cores and Au nanoparticles gave the system sensitive response to both alternating magnetic field (AMF) and near infrared ray (NIR). What's more, the combination of magnetic cores and Au nanoparticles provided a strong medical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal with a linear correlation of 0.9946. The accurate dose related NMR signal and the multi-stimuli sensitive response, including pH, AMF and NIR, make this system immense potential for imaging diagnosis and targeted drug delivery therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in the global population and remains difficult to treat mainly because of the absence of targeted drug delivery stages and restrictions related with delivery of drugs to deep lung tissues. The aim of the present study was to develop a noninvasive, patient-convenient formulation for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells located in the deep lung tissue. A PEGylated paramagnetic hollow-nanosphere was fabricated, fully characterized and used as a nanocarrier for pulmonary co-delivery of Doxorubicin (DOX) and Methotrexate (MTX). In first step, magnetic-silica nanoparticles were synthesized and then coated with amino/acrylate groups and derivatized with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Finally, silica was removed to provide hollow structured nanoparticles. The biocompatibility of blank carriers and the efficiency of MTX-DOX-loaded carriers were also approved by MTT assay and DAPI staining. The aerosolization performance of nanoparticles embedded microspheres were assessed by next generation impactor. The almost natural zeta potential and obvious decrease in silica content observed by EDX and removal of intense silica characteristic peak at FTIR analyses approved the successful removal of silica layer and preparation of hollow-nanospheres. The successful PEGylation of multilayer magnetic hollow-nanospheres catalyzed by boric acid was confirmed by presence of amide groups in FTIR spectra. The developed polymeric nanoparticle showed quite appropriate loading capacity for both DOX and MTX (48%) because of designing adequate negatively and positively charged sites for both drugs. The cytotoxicity assays proved the safety of blank nanoparticles and efficacy of drugs-loaded nanoparticles on lung cancer A549 cell lines. The developed dry powder inhalation formulation of nanoparticles showed appropriate aerosolization performance (fine particle fraction around 22%). It was concluded that these outcomes may open the potentials for efficient pulmonary co-delivery of MTX and DOX to the carcinogenic tissues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) are ion channels with key roles in physiological processes. They are abnormally expressed in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The CaCC component TMEM16A/ANO1 was recently shown to be overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma cells and may serve as a tumorigenic protein. In this study, we determined that matrine is a potent TMEM16A inhibitor that exerts anti-lung adenocarcinoma effects. Patch clamp experiments showed that matrine inhibited TMEM16A current in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 27.94 ± 4.78 μM. Molecular simulation and site-directed mutation experiments demonstrated that the matrine-sensitive sites of the TMEM16A channel involve the amino acids Y355, F411, and F415. Results of cell viability and wound healing assays showed that matrine significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of LA795 cells, which exhibit high TMEM16A expression. In contrast, matrine has only weak inhibitory effect on CCD-19Lu and HeLa cells lacking TMEM16A expression. Matrine-induced effects on the proliferation and migration of LA795 cells were abrogated upon shRNA-mediated TMEM16A knockdown in LA795 cells. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated that matrine dramatically inhibited the growth of lung adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors in mice but did not affect mouse body weight. Collectively, these data indicate that matrine is an effective and safe TMEM16A inhibitor and that TMEM16A is the target of matrine anti-lung adenocarcinoma activity. These findings provide new insight for the development of novel treatments for lung adenocarcinoma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) are known by their immune suppression effects as well as initiation mediators in cancer progression and metastasis. Meanwhile, they are appropriate sources to induce immunity against tumor cells, as consist of tumor specific and associated antigens. The aim of the current study is modifying TEX with microRNA miR-155, miR-142, and let-7i, to enhance their immune stimulation ability and induce potent dendritic cells (DC). For this, exosomes were isolated from mouse mammalian breast cancer cell line; 4T1, and subjected to miR-155, miR-142, and let-7i by electroporation. Immature DCs were generated from mouse bone marrow in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). To mature DCs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TEX, and modified TEX were used. The expression level of miRNAs and their target genes (IL-6, IL-17, IL-1b, TGFβ, SOCS1, KLRK1, IFNγ, and TLR4) was determined. TEX were nanovesicles with spheroid morphology which expressed CD81, CD63, and TSG101, as exosome markers, at protein level. MHCII, CD80, and CD40 as maturation markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Overexpression of miRNAs were confirmed in exosomes and mDCs. Up and downregulation of target genes confirmed the gene network in DC maturation. We found that Let-7i could efficiently induce the DC maturation, as well as miR-142 and miR-155 have enhancing effects. These findings reveal that the modified TEX would be a hopeful cell-free vaccine for the cancer treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a deadly primary brain cancer, exhibits invasive proliferation into healthy brain tissue. Currently, novel treatment methods are being investigated as possible alternatives to the current standard of care for the disease, which consists of tumor resection followed by additional treatment to prevent tumor recurrence. However, investigation into novel GBM treatments remains hindered by the limited ability of preclinical disease models to accurately assess drug effectiveness and toxicity. Recent developments in the fields of biotechnology and tissue engineering have made 3D bioprinting of hydrogel-based biomaterial scaffolds a feasible method for rapidly producing an accurate in vitro model for glioblastoma, custom designed to the needs of the investigator. Here, we developed a novel fibrin-based 3D printed GBM model for cellular characterization and drug screening using an Aspect Biosystems RX1 bioprinter. Their Lab-On-a-Printer™ microfluidic print head minimizes shear stress, allowing for effective printing of delicate neural tissue. Printed glioblastoma cell–laden structures displayed high levels of cell viability for 12 days following initial printing. Furthermore, printed cells spontaneously formed spheroids with upregulated levels of the proteins CD133 and DCX markers associated with cancer stem cells and metastatic invasiveness, respectively. Printed scaffolds were then treated with a novel chemical treatment method previously tested in 2D culture and showed significant resistance, indicating the 3D printed glioblastoma model's potential as a more accurate representation of the in vivo response to drug treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of GAS5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on GAS5 expression. And the signaling pathways underlying the function of GAS5 during the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PC) were clarified. Materials and methods: Patients with PC were recruited and grouped according to their specific genotypes of rs55829688 and rs145204276. Kaplan–Meier overall survival curves were calculated and compared among different groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were conducted to examine the expression of different factors involved in PC. And computational analyses and luciferase assays were conducted to clarify the regulatory relationships among the above factors. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), flow cytometry, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assays were used to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis. Results: The expression of GAS5, PDCD4, PTEN, and AKT was decreased gradually in the order of patient Group 1–4, whereas the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-1284 showed an opposite trend. GAS5 was identified to target miR-21 and miR-1284, whereas miR-21 and miR-1284 regulated the expression of PDCD4/PTEN and AKT, respectively. Moreover, the GAS5/miR-21/PDCD4/PTEN and GAS5/miR-1284/AKT signaling pathway was found to be closely related to the tumorigenesis of PC. Conclusions: GAS5 SNPs affected the survival rate and prognosis in patients with PC via regulating the expression of miR-21/miR-1284, which in turn affected the expression of PDCD4, PTEN, and AKT. GAS5 downregulated the expression of miR-21/miR-1284, thus leading to the elevated expression of key regulators of apoptosis. Therefore, the GAS5 SNPs may be used as key indicators for the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of PC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide, especially in male. With poor prognosis, significant portions of patients with HNSCC die due to cancer recurrence and tumor metastasis after chemotherapy and targeted therapies. The HNSCC FaDu cell ectopic expression of Twist, a key transcriptional factor of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which triggers EMT and results in the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype, was used as the cell model. Our results demonstrated that treatment with newly synthesized 2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methylnaphthyridin-4-one (CSC-3436), a flavonoid derivative, elicited changes in its cell morphology, upregulated E-cadherin messenger RNA and protein expression, downregulated N-cadherin, vimentin, and CD133 (a marker associated with tumor-initiating cells) in FaDu-pCDH-Twist cells. Moreover, CSC-3436 exposure reduced B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1) expression regulated by Twist and further suppressed the direct co-regulation of E-cadherin by Twist and Bmi1. Interestingly, CSC-3436 reduced EMT, cancer stemness, and migration/invasion abilities through the inhibition of the Twist/Bmi1-Akt/β-catenin pathway. Most importantly, our findings provided new evidence that CSC-3436 played a crucial role in therapeutic targeting to Bmi1 and its molecular pathway in HNSCC, and it will be valuable in prognostic prediction and treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Oral cancer represents the third most prevalent form of malignancy in developing countries and the eight most common form of cancer in developed countries. Alcohol and tobacco users are most affected by oral cancers and 90% of them are OSCC in adult males. In some provinces in Iran such as Sistan and Baluchestan, its prevalence is higher compared to other provinces. One of the primary neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is systemic glutamate, which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter. Glutamate signaling has been involved in various non-neuronal cancer processes. The aim of this research was to highlight the association between DNA methylation of the glutamate receptor genes and their expression pattern in pathogenesis of OSCC. Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from 83 OSCC paraffin-embedded tissues (mean age: 59.67 ± 16.08) and 80 normal samples (mean age: 50.15 ± 16.69). Promoter methylation status of glutamate receptors including GRM5, GRM2 and GRIA3 genes were carried out by Methylation Specific PCR technique (MSP). We also investigated the mRNA expression levels of these genes in 15 paraffin-embedded patients and healthy samples using real-time PCR techniques. Result: DNA methylation analysis showed statistically significant differences in the cases in comparison with healthy controls. Our data showed that the promoters of GRM2 and GRIA3 were methylated in the cases. For GRM2 (MM: OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.02–3.90; p-value =.37; MU: OR = 8.0; 95% CI = 1.37–47.34; p-value =.02) and GRIA3 (MM: OR = 47.19; 95% CI = 4.61–483.0; p-value =.001; MU: OR = 1.45; 95% CI = 0.35–5.89; p-value =.6). However, methylation of GRM5 promoter was not statistically different in the cases and healthy controls, GRM5 (MM: OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.14–5.71; p- value = 0.9; MU: OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 0.33–10.09; p-value =.4). In addition, the evaluation of mRNA expression levels of GRM2, GRIA3 and GRM5 were remarkably different in patients and healthy controls (p <.0001). Summarily, the aim of this study was to assess the methylation and expression pattern of GluR genes and the risk of OSCC. We are of the presupposition that methylation and expression statuses of the chosen genes, GRM5, GRM2 and GRIA3 might be significant biomarkers for OSCC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Persistent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a prerequisite for cervical cancer development. Few studies investigated clearance of high-risk HPV in low-and-middle-income countries. Our study investigated HPV clearance and persistence over four years in women from North Tongu District, Ghana. In 2010/2011, cervical swabs of 500 patients were collected and HPV genotyped (nested multiplex PCR) in Accra, Ghana. In 2014, 104 women who previously tested positive for high-risk HPV and remained untreated were re-tested for HPV. Cytobrush samples were genotyped (GP5+/6+ PCR & Luminex-MPG readout) in Berlin, Germany. Positively tested patients underwent colposcopy and treatment if indicated. Of 104 women, who tested high-risk HPV+ in 2010/2011, seven (6,7%; 95%CI: 2.7–13.4%) had ≥1 persistent high-risk‐infection after ~4 years (mean age 39 years). Ninety-seven (93,3%; 95%CI: 86.6–97.3%) had cleared the original infection, while 22 (21.2%; 95%CI: 13.8–30.3%) had acquired new high-risk infections with other genotypes. Persistent types found were HPV 16, 18, 35, 39, 51, 52, 58, and 68. Among those patients, one case of CIN2 (HPV 68) and one micro-invasive cervical cancer (HPV 16) were detected. This longitudinal observational data suggest that single HPV screening rounds may lead to over-referral. Including type-specific HPV re-testing or additional triage methods could help reduce follow-up rates. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Cardiac malignancies are exceptionally rare, mostly occur as secondaries of lung, esophageal tumors, or lymphomas in the context of systemic illness, and usually found on autopsy. We present an exceedingly rare case of solitary metastasis of mucinous adenocarcinoma occupying 80% of the right ventricle and involving tricuspid valve, discovered 17 years after a diagnosis and treatment of a colon cancer. The patient's clinical presentation, diagnosis, and surgical management are detailed. This case provides evidence that late metastasizing colonic carcinoma and ventricular location of metastasis can and do occur. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "We present a case report of a man with a history of esophageal cancer who presented with fever, pain, and lower extremity weakness. The patient previously underwent chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy treatment. He also underwent esophageal dilation, stent placement, and removal. MRI scans of the spine revealed a longitudinal spinal epidural abscess (SEA) resulting in compressive myelopathy. The suspected infection cause was gastrointestinal-associated Gram-negative rods tracking to the epidural space from an esophageal fistula. This case demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis and treatment and the role of fistula as an infection source in SEA. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), the first human retrovirus has been discovered which is known to cause the age-old assassinating disease HTLV-1 associated myelopathy. Cancer caused by this virus is adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma which targets 10–20 million throughout the world. The effect of this virus extends to the fact that it causes chronic disease to the spinal cord resulting in loss of sensation and further causes blood cancer. So, to overcome the complications, we designed a subunit vaccine by the assimilation of B-cell, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, and helper T-lymphocyte epitopes. The epitopes were joined together along with adjuvant and linkers and a vaccine was fabricated which was further subjected to 3D modeling. The physiochemical properties, allergenicity, and antigenicity were evaluated. Molecular docking and dynamics were performed with the obtained 3D model against toll like receptor (TLR-3) immune receptor. Lastly, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression of the designed vaccine in pET28a(+) expression vector. The future prospects of the study entailed the in vitro and in vivo experimental analysis for evaluating the immune response of the designed vaccine construct. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) differentiation antagonizing nonprotein coding RNA (DANCR) has been identified as an oncogene in several cancers. However, the biological function and role of DANCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Our current study aimed to investigate the detailed mechanism of DANCR in HCC. We found that DANCR was significantly upregulated in HCC cell lines in comparison to LO2 cells. Then, we observed that knockdown of DANCR could greatly inhibit Huh7 and HepG2 cell proliferation. In addition, HCC cell apoptosis was increased by silence of DANCR and meanwhile, cell cycle progression was blocked in G1 phase. Apart from these, downregulation of DANCR repressed HCC cell migration and invasion ability obviously. As predicted by the bioinformatics analysis, microRNA-216a-5p (miR-216a-5p) could serve as a direct target of DANCR. MiR-216a-5p has been reported to be involved in many cancers. Here, the correlation between miR-216a-5p and DANCR was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter assay and radioimmunoprecipitation assay. Subsequently, Kruppel-like factor 12 (KLF12) exerts an important role in different tumor types. KLF12 can function as a downstream target of miR-216a-5p. Finally, the in vivo experiments were used and the data proved that DANCR also strongly suppressed HCC tumor growth in vivo via targeting miR-216a-5p and KLF12. In conclusion, our study indicated that DANCR might provide a new perspective for HCC treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Many studies have explored the association between health literacy and health-care utilization; however, the majority assessed functional health literacy in terms of basic skills. Japan's health-care and medical examination system in workplaces is different from that of other major countries. This study examined the relationship of health literacy with health-care use (emergency visit, hospitalization, dental checkup, and health checkup or cancer screening); it focused on differences by occupation and health-care service utilization among general Japanese using the communicative and critical health literacy scale. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of 1002 Japanese residents. Through a questionnaire, we investigated socioeconomic status, health status, health-care use, and health literacy. Among all participants and non-workers, logistic regression analyses revealed that health literacy was significantly associated with health checkup or cancer screening after adjusting for sex, age, marital status, education, and having a disease or disorder (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.431, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.131–1.810; adjusted OR = 1.614, 95% CI, 1.114–2.339, respectively). Among workers, we observed no significant association between health literacy and health-care utilization. These results indicate that health literacy is closely related to use of preventive health-care. Japan's health-care system in workplaces may promote use of preventive health-care services regardless of health literacy, whereas improving health literacy may be more critical among non-workers. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In metazoan genome, the mechanism of gene expression regulation between transcriptional regulatory elements and their target gene is spatiotemporal. Active promoters possess many specific chromosomal features, such as hypersensitive to DNaseI and enrichment of specific histone modifications. In this article, we proposed a novel method which possesses a high efficiency to find promoters in vitro. A promoter-trap library was constructed with totally 706 random mouse genomic DNA fragment clones, and 260 promoter-active fragments of the library were screened by transient transfection into 4T1 cells. To demonstrate the accuracy of this promoter finding method, 13 fragments with promoter activities were randomly selected for published DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data analysis, downstream transcripts prediction and expression confirmation. qRT-PCR results showed that six predicted transcription units were successfully amplified in different mouse tissues/cells or in reconstituted mouse mammary tumors. Our results indicate that this promoter finding method can successfully detect the promoter-active fragments and their downstream transcripts. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Although fluorinated carbon fiber (FC) inherits many excellent properties of carbon materials, and holds great promise in many fields. However, chemical modification and application of FC in biomedicine have been rarely studied, mostly ascribed to large-sized needle-like structure, and inert C–F bonds with strong hydrophobicity. Herein, fluorinated carbon fiber oxide (FCO) enriched with oxygen groups with an average size of 90 nm is prepared, and this then allows us for the first time to modify FCO with biomolecule of hyaluronic acid, rendering FCO special targeting and good dispersibility in various media. Effective control over structure and surface makes FCO exhibit negligible toxicity and possess high near infrared absorption for photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, FCO also has high drug load capacity (1.05 mg/mg), and cell experiments confirm better therapeutic effect of the nanocarrier than single PTT or chemotherapy, making it practically valuable for cancer chemo-photothermal therapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, osteosarcoma survival rates have failed to improve significantly with conventional treatment modalities because of the development of chemotherapeutic resistance. The human breast cancer resistance protein/ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (BCRP/ABCG2), a member of the ATP-binding cassette family, uses ATP hydrolysis to expel xenobiotics and chemotherapeutics from cells. CCN family member 2 (CCN2) is a secreted protein that modulates the biological function of cancer cells, enhanced ABCG2 protein expression and activation in this study via the α6β1 integrin receptor and increased osteosarcoma cell viability. CCN2 treatment downregulated miR-519d expression, which promoted ABCG2 expression. In a mouse xenograft model, knockdown of CCN2 expression increased the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin, which was reversed by ABCG2 overexpression. Our data show that CCN2 increases ABCG2 expression and promotes drug resistance through the α6β1 integrin receptor, whereas CCN2 downregulates miR-519d. CCN2 inhibition may represent a new therapeutic concept in osteosarcoma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Mortality of patients treated on the intensive care unit suffering from cancer is high, especially when admitted with an unknown malignancy. Still, anti-tumor therapy in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation is a clinical challenge. Over the last years, successful chemotherapy has been reported, even in critically ill patients with infections and organ failure. In this report, we present a 42-year old male patient who later was been diagnosed for a highly-malignant lymphoma (Burkitt) developed an abdominal compartment syndrome due to ileus, ascites and progressive intestinal tumor manifestation. During the course, he required mechanical ventilation and developed several organ failures including need for renal replacement therapy. After laparotomy the abdomen was left open and managed by a vacuum dressing. The patient received systemic chemotherapy and broad anti-infective treatment in presence of markedly elevated markers of inflammation. Fortunately, he was successfully weaned from vasopressor and respiratory support. By obtaining negative fluid balances closure of the abdomen succeeded 18 days after laparotomy. The patient was transferred to the normal ward without organ dysfunction on day 27 and discharged home after a second cycle of chemotherapy. In conclusion, aggressive treatment using chemotherapy in critically ill patients with initially unkown malignancy may be successful. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a multifunctional magnetic Bio-Metal-Organic Framework (Fe 3 O 4 @Bio-MOF) coated with folic acid-chitosan conjugate (FC) was successfully prepared for tumor-targeted delivery of curcumin (CUR) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) simultaneously. Bio-MOF nanocomposite based on CUR as organic linker and zinc as metal ion was prepared by hydrothermal method in the presence of amine-functionalized Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 @NH 2 MNPs). 5-FU was loaded in the magnetic Bio-MOF and the obtained nanocarrier was then coated with FC network. The prepared nanocomposite (NC) was fully characterized by high resolution-transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and UV–vis analyses. In vitro release study showed controlled release of CUR and 5-FU in acidic pH confirming high selectivity and performance of the carrier in cancerous microenvironments. The selective uptake of 5-FU-loaded Fe 3 O 4 @Bio-MOF-FC by folate receptor-positive MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated and verified. The ultimate nanocarrier exhibited no significant toxicity, while drug loaded nanocarrier showed selective and higher toxicity against the cancerous cells than normal cells. SDS PAGE was also utilized to determine the protein pattern attached on the surface of the nanocarriers. In vitro and in vivo MRI studies showed negative signal enhancement in tumor confirming the ability of the nanocarrier to be applied as diagnostic agent. Owing to the selective anticancer release and cellular uptake, acceptable blood compatibility as well as suitable T 2 MRI contrast performance, the target nanocarrier could be considered as favorable theranostic in breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT) using a resectoscope has been standard treatment for bladder cancer. However, no treatment method promotes the repair of resected bladder tissue. The aim of this study was to examine the healing process of damaged bladder tissue after a transurethral injection of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the bladder. An injection of magnetic MSCs meant that they accumulated in the damaged area of the bladder. Another aim of this study was to compare the acceleration effect of MSC magnetic delivery on the repair of bladder tissue with that of non-magnetic MSC injection. Methods: Using the transurethral approach to avoid opening the abdomen, electrofulguration was carried out on the anterior wall of the urinary bladder of white Japanese rabbits to mimic tumor resection. An external magnetic field directed at the injured site was then applied using a 1-tesla (T) permanent magnet. Twelve rabbits were divided into three groups. The 1 × 106 of magnetically labeled MSCs were injected into the urinary bladder with or without the magnetic field (MSC M+ and MSC M-groups, respectively), and phosphate-buffered saline was injected as the control. The effects of the injections in the three groups at 14 days were examined using 4.7-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then macroscopically and histologically. The mRNA expressions of several cytokines in the repair tissues were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The macroscopic findings showed the area of repair tissue in the MSC M+ group to be larger than that in either the MSC M-group or control group. MRI clearly depicted the macroscopic findings. The histological study showed that repair of the cauterized area with myofibrous tissue was significantly better in the MSC M+ group than that in either the MSC M-group or control group, although there was no significant difference in several mRNA cytokines among the three groups at 14 days after surgery. Conclusions: The magnetic delivery of MSCs shows promise as an effective, minimally invasive method of enhancing tissue regeneration after TURBT. © 2018 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine",

    "Abstract": "Clival chordomas represent very challenging neoplasms, due to their tendency to infiltrate bone, frequent recurrence, involvement of important neurovascular structures, and deep location. Lesions involving the brainstem remain difficult to access through conventional skull-base approaches which are often associated with significant morbidities. We present a successful purely endoscopic endonasal transclival resection of a rare chordoma located in the ventromedial pons. Recent advances in endoscopic technology make endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) a possible alternative to the treatment of ventral brainstem lesions. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Sorafenib is the first-line treatment of HCC. Although sorafenib has positive effects on the survival of patients, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to extend survival and improve the efficacy of sorafenib. This study combines sorafenib with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a new approach to enhance the efficacy of sorafenib. Material and methods: A subcutaneous xenograft model of HCC, established by human HepG2 cell lines, was implanted into the flank of nude mice and was used to evaluate tumor growth after treatment with sorafenib alone or in combination with MSCs. The aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels were measured for safety assessment. Histopathological studies were performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry tests were performed to evaluate proliferation (Ki67) and angiogenesis (CD34). The TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis and measure the expression of major inflammatory cytokines (IL-1a, IL-10, and TNF-α) with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result: Sorafenib, in combination with MSCs, strongly inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft model. Furthermore, the combination therapy significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, decreased tumor angiogenesis, and induced apoptosis and maintained antitumor-associated anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs. Conclusion: This combination therapy strategy could be used as a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of HCC that significantly improves upon the results achieved using sorafenib as monotherapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Mucin1 (MUC1), a member of the mucin family, is a glycoprotein which is often expressed in malignant cells. However, the expression and function of MUC1 in human duodenal adenocarcinoma (DAC) has not yet been characterized because of its low frequency. Here, we examined the functional roles of core protein (MUC1-C) in DAC. Materials and methods: Using a human duodenal cancer cell line, HuTu80, proliferation, migration, invasion, ALDH activity was assessed by cell counting kit–8, scratch wound healing, matrigel invasion, and ALDEFUOR assays, respectively. The function of MUC1 protein was evaluated with knockdown using specific siRNA as well as anti-MUC1-C peptide, GO203. MUC1 expression in human DAC was evaluated immunohistochemically in surgically resected tumors. Results: The positive expression of MUC1 in HuTu80 was confirmed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. In vitro cell growth was inhibited by the addition of 50-100 μM GO203 as well as treatment with siRNA for MUC1-C. Silencing of MUC1-C also significantly reduced migration, invasion, ALDH activity. Local injection of GO-203 (14 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous HuTu80 tumors in nude mice. Immunohistochemically, MUC1 was strongly detected in seven DAC cases, but not in 11 others. The outcome of patients with high MUC1 expression was significantly worse than those without MUC1 expression. Conclusions: These results suggest that MUC1 is functionally associated with the malignant potential of DAC and could be a novel therapeutic target for this rare tumor. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Rational: Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMTs) are rare tumors often causing tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), with surgical resection being the first line in the treatment of TIO. There are very few reports of PMTs located in the brain. The authors present one such case, it's management and outcome as well as a review of the literature. Patient concerns: The authors report of a 58 year old male with a background of osteoporosis, bone pain, muscle weakness and gait disturbances for the past several years. He presented to our institution with newly developed absence spells. He underwent imaging which revealed a brain tumor. Interventions: The patient underwent surgery for what was suspected as a meningioma. A gross total resection was done. The pathological diagnosis was that of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor. Outcomes: Removal of the tumor helped in alleviating the patient's back symptoms immediately after surgery. The patient was discharged home and was followed up by an endocrinologist, with improvement of his bone pain, his muscle weakness and his gait disturbances. Lessons: PMT with involvement of the brain can be treated surgically. Removal of the tumor will alleviate symptoms in patients harboring this rare brain tumor. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and the third of cancer mortality worldwide. Although the study of HCC has made great progress, the molecular mechanism and signal pathways of HCC are not yet clear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the early diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for HCC. The aim of this study is to screen the relevant genes and study the association of gene expression with the survival status of HCC patients using bioinformatics approaches, in the hope of establishing marker genes for diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. The gene expression data and corresponding clinical information of HCC samples were downloaded from the The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We performed to study the relationship between gene expression and prognosis of HCC and screen significantly relevant genes associated with prognosis of HCC by analyzing survival and function enrichment of genes. In this study, we collected 421 samples with gene expression data, including 371 tumor samples and 50 normal samples. By using single factor Cox regression analysis, we screened 1,197 genes significantly associated with survival time in the modeling data containing 117 samples and also searched six genes as the best markers to predict living status of HCC patients. Besides, we established score system of survival risk of HCC. Our study recognized six genes (PGBD3, PGM5P3-AS1, RNF5, UTP11, BAG6, and KCND2) to be significantly associated with diagnosis and prognosis of HCC, providing novel targets for studying potential mechanism about the progression of HCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Presently, quite a lot of research that are being carried out to find a potential cure for cancer and many had made to clinical trial stage as well. In the present study, we focus on use of a novel graphene oxide functionalized chitosan nanoparticle targeting Saos-2 and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. The graphene oxide chitosan nanoparticles were loaded with siRNA, studied for in vitro release with varying concentration & pH, and fitted to peppas model. MTT & ROS assay was used to evaluate biocompatibility of carrier and qPCR to study the inflammatory responses in particular checking gene expression of IL-6, TGF-ß, TNF-α in both RAW 264.7 and bone marrow derived macrophages. The results of study showed that release of siRNA were in a controlled fashion and effective at acidic pH that prevails on tumor site. The material was biocompatible and effective in case of Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells with a viability of 0.4 ± 0.43 and 0.49 ± 0.53 in case of MG-63 cells when treated with highest concentration of 100 μl siRNA compared to untreated cells that were in range of 0.64 ± 0.67 in Saos-2 and 0.61 ± 0.63 in MG-63 cells. The results of expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TGF-β & TNF-α showed negligible amount compared to control group serving the purpose of an effective carrier targeting tumor cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Herein, a delicate ratiometric electrochemiluminescence biosensor was designed for the detection of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) based on 2-(Dibutylamino)ethanol (DBAE) and lucigenin as anodic and cathodic ECL emitter, respectively. Initially, NiFe 2 O 4 nanotubes (NiFe 2 O 4 NTs) with charming properties could act as catalytically promoted sensing platform. This NiFe 2 O 4 NTs based platform could trigger an intense ECL emission of DBAE for the reason that NiFe 2 O 4 NTs not only achieved the high loading of Envision-Ab 1 complex but effectively catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to yield oxygen. Moreover, the Envision complex, a polymeric material containing enrich horseradish peroxidase (HRP) could further accelerate the H 2 O 2 decomposition to generate superoxide (O 2 [rad] − ) for the enhancement of the ECL emission process of two luminophors. It's noteworthy that hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BN) as the nanolabels, was first illustrated to be capable of immobilizing a large quantity of lucigenin and retaining intense and stable ECL emission of lucigenin in the alkaline condition. Benefiting from the above merits, a new ECL ratiometric sensing mode was established for the sensitive determination of HE4 in a range from 10 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with the detection limit of 3.3 fg/mL. The strategy exhibited broad prospect in early ovarian cancer diagnosis and blazed a new path for other tumors screening. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A large range of nanoscale superparamagnetic materials has been under scrutiny from the point of view of their potential theranostic, multimodal applications. In this paper we have investigated the effect of replacing Fe 3+ cations with Gd 3+ and Tb 3+ in the core of the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in search for the optimum level of magnetic core doping with these lanthanides. We have found that the presence of Gd 3+ and Tb 3+ up to 2.5% at. does not alter significantly the crystallographic structure of such nanoferrites and does not compromise the magnetic properties of doped nanoparticles. The doping level, though relatively small, exceeds the levels of currently used radiopharmaceuticals, where only few radionuclides can be incorporated in a single radiotherapeutic molecule. This new type of multifunctional nanoparticles can be used not only as drug carriers or in magnetic hyperthermia, but also in the so-called endoradiotherapy. The latter feature can be easily implemented upon the replacement of “cold” ions of Tb 3+ and Gd 3+ in the superparamagnetic core with their isotopes emitting soft β − radiation suitable for the internal radiotherapy, localized directly within the tumor. Therefore, these nanoparticles can be used simultaneously in targeted drug delivery, hyperthermia and radiotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: While most human papillomavirus (HPV) infection clears on its own, persistent HPV infection can cause genital warts and anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers in men. We conducted genetic analysis in a sub-cohort of the HPV infection in men (HIM) study to test the hypothesis that differences in host genes influence HPV persistence in men. Methods: Baseline and longitudinal genital HPV status at the genitals was measured every 6-months using the Linear Array assay amplified HPV L1 gene fragment using the PGMY09/11 L1 consensus primer system. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the customized genome-wide genotyping array, the “TxArray,” were examined using logistic regression in a case-control study design to assess the association with HPV16 persistence/clearance. Results: Of the total of 737,742 autosomal SNPs in the array, 605,885 passed basic quality control and were examined between 40 men (cases) with &gt; 18 months persistent genital HPV 16 infection vs. 151 controls who were HPV 16-positive, but whose infections cleared in &lt; 18 months. The logistic regression analysis from this case-control study showed variants in several gene regions associated with genital HPV 16 persistence, with the strongest association detected with SNPs on chromosomes 20 (p &lt; 5.72 × 10−6) and 15 (p &lt; 5.89 × 10−6), after adjusting for age, smoking status, number of sex partners and four principal components (ancestral background). Conclusions: Our results provide a preliminary basis for understanding the biological mechanism of oncogenic HPV 16 pathogenesis at the genitals in men. Some of the genes flanking the top hit SNPs are consistent with previous findings in both HPV related and non-related cancers but further genetic studies in larger cohorts are warranted to confirm these and identify novel major susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of genital HPV persistence in men. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Curcumin (CR) is a natural compound with a well-known antioxidant and therapeutic activity. Its stability may be enhanced when incorporated in different matrices as a layered double hydroxides (LDH) matrix. Curcumin intercalated layered double hydroxide nanohybrid is a potential drug delivery system for effective photodynamic therapy in human breast cancer or skin cancer. The synthesis of the hybrid LDH-CR powder implies the dissolution of CR in water or in another organic solvent which is miscible with water. Since the solubility of curcumin in water is very weak, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the solvent employed for its dissolution on the structural and physico-chemical-photoluminescent properties of the resulting hybrid materials. Four powders of curcumin (CR)-containing Mg2.5Al-LDH hybrids (Mg/Al molar ratio of 2.5) were prepared by co-precipitation (P) and reconstruction (R) using two different solvents for the dissolution of curcumin: (i) an alkaline aqueous solution (A), and (ii) ethanol (E). The reconstruction used the calcinated (460 °C for 18 h) form of the parent Mg2.5Al-LDH powder. All the solids were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR-ATR spectra of the all the powders except the powder prepared via reconstruction in ethanol exhibit LDH characteristics, consistent with the XRD results. Matrix Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation (MAPLE) was employed for the deposition of hybrid LDH-CR thin films. Aqueous solutions of the as prepared hybrid LDH-CR powders were frozen and used as targets for MAPLE depositions. The films were deposited using a nanosecond laser emitting at 266 nm. MAPLE is considered a “soft” deposition technique suitable to conserve the CR stability. XRD, scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements were used to characterize the deposited films in order to evidence the influence of the preparation methods on the structural and photophysical characteristics of the hybrid LDH-CR films. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The study aimed to identify the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) biomarkers for occurrence and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and simultaneously to investigate the potential role of lncRNAs in the oncogenesis of HCC. The lncRNAs expression data and the corresponding clinical information of HCC samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The differentially expressed genes and lncRNAs were identified and the correlation networks were constructed. In this study, we identified 212 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 7,577 differentially expressed genes between liver HCC tumor tissues and normal tissue samples. And then, combining with clinical information, a total of 11 lncRNAs and 162 genes as HCC biomarkers were identified by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Further, through coexpress network analysis, we confirmed four lncRNAs (lncRNA_ANKRD10.IT1, lncRNA_CTD.2583A14.8, lncRNA_RP11.404P21.3, and lncRNA_RP11.488L18.10), which can serve as prognostic biomarkers for HCC. The four lncRNAs identified in this study may serve as a potential therapy target for HCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A novel hydrogel shell on cancer cells was prepared via in situ photopolymerization of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate (PEGDA) using methylene blue (MB) sensitized mesoporous titania nanocrystal for effective photodynamic therapy (PDT). TiO 2 in this system served as an effective photosensitizer and initiator for the formation of hydrogel, also can protect the MB from being degraded into an inactive form. While MB was used as a significant photosensitive additive to improve the photochemistry effects of TiO 2 and widen its optical response area to near infrared region (660–900 nm). The PEGDA hydrogel with peritumoral injectability shows competitive advantages, i.e. good biocompatibility and hydrophily, selective and minimally invasive delivery of TiO 2 @MB, maintaining a high PDT drug concentration for inducing tumor apoptosis, localized and sustainable release under 660 nm laser irradiation for reducing side effect. The hydrogel also could load chemo-therapy drugs, and serve as a versatile platform for multimode antitumor treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Glucosinolates (GLS) have been reported to have significant anti-oxidative, antimicrobial, and anti-cancer activities. The current study was aimed to develop an analytical method for glucosinolate quantitation in eight Brassica species from Gwangju, Republic of Korea. For this purpose the UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS technique was used and validated for optimal extraction conditions, detection and quantitation limits, linearity, precision, and accuracy. According to the results of GLS profiling, the total GLS concentration decreased in the order of cabbage > broccoli > cauliflower > mustard > kimchi cabbage > young radish ∼ kale. All Brassica species contained glucoerucin (GER) and glucobrassicin (GBR) as major GLS with the high levels in cabbage (5.913 μM/g) and broccoli (1.723 μM/g), respectively. The contents of minor GLS were species-dependent, and could therefore be used for Brassica species classification. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Randomized experiment is an important tool for studying the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). This paper considers the regression adjustment estimation of the Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) in high-dimensional case, where the multicollinearity problem is often encountered and needs to be properly handled. Many existing regression adjustment methods fail to achieve satisfactory performances. To solve this issue, an Elastic-net adjusted estimator for SATE is proposed under the Rubin causal model of randomized experiments with multicollinearity in high dimensions. The asymptotic properties of the proposed SATE estimator are shown under some regularity conditions, and the asymptotic variance is proved to be not greater than that of the unadjusted estimator. Furthermore, Neyman-type conservative estimators for the asymptotic variance are proposed, which yields tighter confidence intervals than both the unadjusted and the Lasso-based adjusted estimators. Some simulation studies are carried out to show that the Elastic-net adjusted method is better in addressing collinearity problem than the existing methods. The advantages of our proposed method are also shown in analyzing the dataset of HER2 breast cancer patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Spindlin 1 (SPIN1), which contains Tudor-like domains, regulates maternal transcripts via interaction with a messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein. SPIN1 is involved in tumorigenesis in somatic cells and is highly expressed in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the role of SPIN1 in porcine oocyte maturation remains totally unknown. To explore the function of SPIN1 in porcine oocyte maturation, knockdown, and overexpression techniques were used. SPIN1 mRNA was identified in maternal stages ranging from GV to MII. SPIN1 was localized in the cytoplasm and to chromosomes during meiosis. SPIN1 knockdown accelerated first polar body extrusion. Oocytes with overexpressed SPIN1 were arrested at the MI stage. SPIN1 depletion caused meiotic spindle defects and chromosome instability. The BUB3 signal was investigated, confirming that SPIN1 affects the stability of Bub3 mRNA as well as BUB3 expression. Further, overexpression of SPIN1 inhibited the degradation and regulation of G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B1. In summation, SPIN1 regulates the meiotic cell cycle by modulating the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Nanocomposites of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) generate heat under an alternating magnetic field and therefore have potential applications as thermoseeds for cancer hyperthermia treatment. However, the properties of such nanocomposites as biomaterials have not been sufficiently well characterized. In this study, the osteoconductivity of Fe 3 O 4 -rGO nanocomposites of various compositions was evaluated in vitro in terms of their apatite-forming ability in simulated body fluid (SBF). Furthermore, the heat generation of the nanocomposites was measured under an alternating magnetic field. The apatite-forming ability in SBF improved as the Fe 3 O 4 content in the nanocomposite was increased. As the Fe 3 O 4 content was increased, the nanocomposite not only rapidly raised the surrounding temperature to approximately 100 °C, but the specific absorption rate also increased. We assumed that the ionic interaction between the Fe 3 O 4 and rGO was enhanced and that Brown relaxation was suppressed as the proportion of rGO in the nanocomposite was increased. Consequently, a high content of Fe 3 O 4 in the nanocomposite was effective for improving both the osteoconductivity and heat generation characteristics for hyperthermia applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Assay technologies capable of detecting biomarker concentrations in unprocessed whole blood samples are fundamental for applications in medical diagnostics. SERS nano-tags integrated magnetic-separation biosensor (MSB) was realized for the first time for immunoassay in whole blood. The reliability and sensitivity of this method rely, in a large extent, on the quality and properties of the SERS nano-tags. The constructed silicacoated Ag SERS nano-tags as labels were used in a rapid and specific MSB immune sensor to detect Matrix Metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) in unprocessed blood samples. With fast screening ability and outstanding sensitivity, we anticipate that this method would greatly promote practical application of stroke-based early-stage cancer diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Artemisia annua L. is the main artemisinin source, a sesquiterpene lactone used in the treatment against cancer and malaria, whose demand is high and the costs involving its production must be feasible. The main objective of the present work was to define a industrially and economically viable technology to obtain artemisinin. The experimental conditions of temperature, pressure and co-solvent use for obtaining extracts enriched in artemisinin by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) were investigated, and an economic evaluation of the SFE was performed in comparison with the conventional extraction using ethanol. The techno-economic analysis showed that among the conditions evaluated in the present study, SFE at 60 °C and 250 bar, without co-solvent, was the most promising production condition. Nevertheless, for the commercial viability of the arteminisin extraction using SFE it is indicated to use A. annua rigorously selected, and to reduce costs of raw material. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we used anti-cancer flutamide (FM) as a radical pair-forming drug to investigate whether magnetic fields can control a liposomal drug release through differences in the physical properties of biomembranes. Irradiations of FM-incorporated liposomal nanoparticles (FM-LNs) were performed using an original air-cooled UV-LED irradiation system. Exposure to a static magnetic field of 0.2 T was performed using a pair of commercially available permanent magnets. For evaluating the drug-release potentials with spin-correlated radical pair mechanisms on the photochemical reactions developing in biomembranes, we prepared various types of FM-LNs equipped with possible magnetic controls. According to the overall result of the prepared FM-LNs, the drug release is deemed not to be caused by only the pair mechanisms. But the tests observing the magnetic field effects on the mechanisms must provide useful information on drug targeting. We strongly propose a new drug-release technology using these liposomal nanoparticles equipped with magnetic controls. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Hsp90s are key proteins in cellular homeostasis since they interact with many client proteins. Several studies indicated that Hsp90s are potential targets for treating diseases, such as cancer or malaria. It has been shown that Hsp90s from different organisms have peculiarities despite their high sequence identity. Therefore, a detailed comparative analysis of several Hsp90 proteins is relevant to the overall understanding of their activity. Accordingly, the goal of this work was to evaluate the interaction of either ADP or ATP with recombinant Hsp90s from different organisms (human α and β isoforms, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania braziliensis, yeast and sugarcane) by isothermal titration calorimetry. The measured thermodynamic signatures of those interactions indicated that despite the high identity among all Hsp90s, they have specific thermodynamic characteristics. Specifically, the interactions with ADP are driven by enthalpy but are opposed by entropy, whereas the interaction with ATP is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. Complimentary structural and molecular dynamics studies suggested that specific interactions with ADP that differ from those with ATP may contribute to the observed enthalpies and entropies. Altogether, the data suggest that selective inhibition may be more easily achieved using analogues of the Hsp90-ADP bound state than those of Hsp90-ATP bound state. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Metallic therapeutic agents have been widely used in cancer therapy. Iron-based phases that work in concert with porous grafts provide promising strategies for chemotherapy and bone repair after surgery. However, seldom are studies associated to the involvement of extrinsic iron ions in the essential angiogenesis of implantation. In this work, we fabricated a novel iron-loaded biocomposite scaffold with hierarchical channels toward unraveling the influence of Fe 3+ release on the angiogenic response of bone grafts. Iron-doped octacalcium phosphate (Fe-OCP) as a viable controllable ferric agent was prepared by homogeneous precipitation through hydrolysis of carbamide. The intervention of Fe 3+ altered the crystallochemical properties of OCP with preferential growth of plane (h 0 0) and inhibition growth of plane (0 0 l). Fe-OCP significantly promoted the affinity, viability, proliferation, and angiogenic differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffold with Fe-OCP showed enhanced deposition of bone-like apatites and sustained Fe 3+ release under simulated physiological environment. The scaffold supported endothelial cells adhesion and spreading, and notably enhanced angiogenesis with more blood vessels formation and higher specific markers expression. Results suggest that Fe 3+ can increase HIF-1α levels and VEGF expression, and promote NO secretion and eNOS production, thus mediating endothelial cells behaviors and angiogenesis. These findings illuminate the remarkable angiogenic capability of iron-loaded grafts for potential cancerous bone repair, which paves the way for developing functionalized bone grafts in therapeutic biomaterials applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Distinct metastasis is one of the main causes of breast cancer (BC)-related mortality and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a primary step in metastasis dissemination. On the other hand, doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent against BC; unfortunately, its clinical use is limited by dose-dependent side effects. Therefore, extensive efforts have been dedicated to suppressing metastasis of BC and also to overcome DOX side effects together with keeping its antitumor efficacy. Studies supported the role of oleuropein (OLEU) in reducing DOX-induced side effects besides its antitumor actions. In this study, the antimigratory effect of OLEU was assessed and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect OLEU effect on the expression level of EMT markers, in MCF-7 cells. The cytotoxic effect of OLEU and DOX was assessed by MTT assay, whereas the ratio of apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry. The results showed that migration ability of MCF-7 cells remarkably decreased in OLEU treated group and RT-PCR results showed that OLEU may exert its antimigratory action by suppressing EMT through downregulation of sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Also, the results indicated that both OLEU and DOX were cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells, whereas DOX-OLEU cotreatment led to additive cytotoxicity and apoptosis rate. This study provides evidence regarding the suppressive role of OLEU on MCF-7 cells migration ability through suppression of EMT, and for the first time, it was proposed that SIRT1 downregulation can be involved in the OLEU antimigratory effect. Also, the findings demonstrated that OLEU can reduce DOX-induced side effects by reducing its effective dose. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "We introduce for first time a facile protocol for the rapid synthesis of a molybdenum nanoclusters (MoNCs) at room temperature using thiolated dithiothreitol (DTT) as capping agents. The initial fluorescence from the MoNCs is observed in 30 min and further intensified in 48 h. The mean diameter of nanoclusters was found to be 1.5 nm with −77 mV zeta potential. The nanoclusters have good stability in all tested pH ranges, especially between pH 7 and 10. This property makes the nanomaterial to be ideal for many types of possible biological/biomedicine applications such as drug delivery or biological imaging. The quantum yield of thiolated MoNCs was calculated to be 59% which is higher than the noble metal nanoclusters reported earlier. The mechanism of formation of MoNCs was investigated using the UV–Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Owing to these characteristics, MoNCs were used for imaging of HaCaT and A549 cancer cells. The current approach on novel synthesis of MoNCs is found to be a superior alternative to conventional/popular MoS 2 based on the method of synthesis, particle size, and fluorescence quantum yield. The current approach on the MoNCs has created a new platform for future biomedicine applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: We report four cases of spinal Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) that were managed surgically at King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. This report aims to describe the clinical features and the need for surgical excision preceded by embolization in spinal ABC. Method: A retrospective review of the OR list and tumor board records between 2013 and 2016 yielded a total of 4 cases of spinal ABC who were surgically treated at KFSH-D. Their clinical presentations, radiological and pathological features are reviewed along with the surgical intervention utilized and its outcome. Results: Total of 4 cases were identified, all of them were female (100%). The age ranged from 13 to 25 years old (mean age = 17.75). Two cases (50%) were located in the thoracic spine, one (25%) cervical and one (25%) in the lumbar spine. Back pain, unsteady gait, and progressive limb weakness were the most common presenting symptoms. All the cases underwent embolization followed by surgical excision and fixation with a variable degree of improvement postoperatively. Conclusion: Spinal ABC is a benign tumor that can present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms. Pre-operative embolization can be helpful to reduce bleeding during surgery. Surgical decompression can lead to significant improvement even in case of severe neurological deficit. Radiation therapy can be used as an adjunct treatment in selected cases. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Extensive investigations into long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various diseases and cancers, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been conducted. The current study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA solute carrier family 8 member A1 antisense RNA 1 (SLC8A1-AS1) in myocardial damage by targeting solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1) via cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-protein kinase G (cGMP-PKG) signaling pathway in AMI mouse models. Differentially expressed lncRNA in AMI were initially screened and target relationship between lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1 and SLC8A1 was then verified. Infarct size, levels of inflammatory factors, biochemical indicators, and the positive expression of the SLC8A1 protein in AMI were subsequently determined. The expression of SLC8A1-AS1, SLC8A1, PKG1, PKG2, atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide was detected to assess the effect of SLC8A1-AS1 on SLC8A1 and cGMP-PKG. The respective contents of superoxide dismutase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected accordingly. Microarray data GSE66360 provided evidence indicating that SLC8A1-AS1 was poorly expressed in AMI. SLC8A1 was verified to be a target gene of lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1. SLC8A1-AS1 upregulation decreased levels of left ventricular end-systolic diameter, −dp/ dt max , interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, transforming growth factor α, nitric oxide, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, infarct size, LDH activity and MDA content, and increased IL-10, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and + dp/ dt max . Furthermore, the overexpression of SLC8A1-AS1 was noted to elicit an inhibitory effect on the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway via SLC8A1. In conclusion, lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1, by downregulating SLC8A1 and activating the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, was observed to alleviate myocardial damage, inhibit the release of proinflammatory factors and reduce infarct size, ultimately protecting against myocardial damage. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previous studies using the NSQIP database to study hepatectomies lacked hepatic specific variables and outcomes. We used the targeted NSQIP hepatectomy database to examine the nationwide trend and the safety profile of synchronous liver and colorectal resection compared with hepatectomy alone for colorectal liver metastasis. Methods: The targeted NSQIP hepatectomy database from 2014 was used to study patients who underwent hepatectomy for diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum. Results: Of the 3064 hepatic resections in the database, 1138 cases were performed for colorectal metastasis. Of these, 1040 were liver-alone surgery and 98 were synchronous liver and colorectal resection. Most (58.7%) patients received neoadjuvant therapy. The rate of neoadjuvant therapy, intraoperative ablation, biliary reconstruction, and the use of minimally invasive technique were similar between the two groups. The overall 30-d mortality in this cohort was low (1.1%). While the mortality rate in the synchronous group was similar to liver-only group (3.1% versus 0.9%, P = 0.077). The rate of liver failure (3.3% versus 4.1%, P = 0.722) and biliary leak (5.3% versus 9.6%, P = 0.084) were similar between the two groups. However, the rate of major complications was higher on multivariable analyses (25.5% versus 12.1%, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.1, P < 0.001) for the synchronous group. Conclusions: Hepatic resection for colorectal metastasis in the modern era has low short-term mortality. While synchronous resection was associated with a higher incidence of major complications, liver-specific complications did not increase with synchronous resection. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Non-ionic surfactants have raised a considerable interest for solubilization, encapsulation, permeabilization and controlled release of various compounds due to their unique physicochemical properties. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to create convenient self-assembled multifunctional materials with high solubilization and encapsulation capacities by preserving their advanced capabilities to protect loaded cargos without altering their characteristics. In this work, we present an extended concept of micellar clusters (MCs) formation based on partial entrapment and stabilization of chelate ligands by hydrophobic forces found on the non-ionic surfactant micelle interface of the Triton-X family (TX-100/TX-114), followed by subsequent complexation of the preformed structures either by metal ions or a supporting chelator. The formation aspects, inner structure and the role of external factors such as the addition of competitive ligands have been extensively studied. MCs loaded by hydrophobic fluorescent compounds with high encapsulation efficiency demonstrate an excellent optical response in aqueous media without crystallization as well as sufficient increase in solubility of toxic hydrophobic compounds such as bilirubin (>50 times compared to pure surfactants). Furthermore, Triton-X-based MCs provide a unique feature of selective permeability to hydrophilic ligand-switching proteins such as UnaG and BSA demonstrating bright “turn-on” fluorescence signal either inside the cluster or on its interface via complexation. The proposed strategies allowed us to successfully encapsulate and visualize a newly synthesized, highly hydrophobic anticancer PTR-58-CLB-CAMP peptide drug, while MCs loaded by the drug exhibit a considerable antitumor activity against HeLa cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Recently, drug delivery using natural and biodegradable nanoparticles has attracted huge attention. This study focused to deliver an anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug Ginsenoside Rb1 through chitosan-Alginate nanocomposite film prepared by solution method. Ginsenoside Rb1 is a dammaran saponin group, which is extracted from an herbaceous plant Panax notoginseng. Ginsenoside loaded alginate-chitosan nanocomposite films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. The FTIR spectra of alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films show that chitosan, alginate, and ginsenoside Rb1 are linked through the hydrogen bonding and dipolar-dipolar interactions. The FESEM image indicates that the chitosan and ginsenoside Rb1 dispersed well in the alginate matrix. The DSC diagrams display that melting temperature of alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films higher than that of chitosan and lower than that of alginate. It means that alginate and chitosan interact together. Investigation of the ginsenoside Rb1 release from alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films at different pH solutions and different ginsenoside Rb1 content has been carried out by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy method. The rate of drug release is proportional to the increase in pH solution and inversely proportional to the content of loaded ginsenoside Rb1. The Rb1 release process includes two stages: burst release in the first 10 hours, then constant release afterwards. The suitable ratio of alginate/chitosan to prepare the alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films for further investigations was found out to be 8:2. Ginsenoside Rb1 release process from alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films was believed to be first-order kinetics in the first stage, and then the Rb1 release complies with Higuchi kinetic model in the slow release stage. This study demonstrated the novel synthesis methodology to design drug delivery system based on ginsenoside Rb1 loaded to chitosan/alginate nanocomposite films.",

    "Abstract": "Arsenic contamination has raised great concern around the world as the cause of many severe health issues, including internal and external cancers. Discharging arsenic waste into the environment before proper handling is strictly forbidden. In order to treat the arsenic-bearing wastes in a safe way, we used the oxidation alkali leaching to dissolve arsenic in the low-risk state arsenate (AsO 4 3− ) firstly, followed by recycling of the alkali solution after arsenate removal. In this paper, we synthesized high-concentrated ferric oxyhydroxide gels (HFGs) with different supersaturation in a hydrothermal system to adsorb arsenate anions at high alkali without consuming the hydroxyls. The arsenate adsorption onto HFGs followed the pseudo second-order and intra-particle diffusion kinetics and fitted Langmuir isotherms model well. Through characterization of the synthesized HFGs particles by XRD, Raman spectra, SEM and TGA, it was confirmed that the surface hydroxyl sites on the ferric oxyhydroxide reacted with arsenates to form the bidentate surface complexation. In addition, the synthesized HFG at lower supersaturation had lower crystallinity and more surface hydroxyl sites, resulting in higher adsorption capacity for arsenate. Using HFG as the adsorbent, the arsenic (V) concentration in the copper slag alkali leaching solution can be reduced from 2084 mg/L to 71.8 mg/L, which can realize stabilization of the high-concentrated arsenate at high alkali and alkali solution recycling. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The genus Bauhinia belongs to the family Fabaceae and comprises about 18,000 known species in the world. In Brazil, approximately more than 60 native species of Bauhinia are found. Bauhinia leaves tea infusion or other preparations have been widely used in the Brazilian popular medicine for treatment of several illnesses. Therefore, this work aims to a better understanding of Bauhinia longifolia to provide a valuable database for its quality control, pharmacological and toxicological studies. For the chemical analysis, a liquid chromatography-high resolution quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer method was applied to evaluate the chemical profile of Bauhinia longifolia ethanolic leaves extracts, allowing for the identification of 75 compounds comprising chemical classes of phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, and O-glycosides flavonoids. Most polyphenols were identified for the first time in this specie. In addition, six compounds were isolated and fully identified by liquid chromatography hyphenate to solid phase extraction and nuclear magnetic resonance. Herein, myricitrin, juglanin, afzelin, and bauhiniastatin 2 are reported for the first time for Bauhinia longifolia. Bauhiniastatin 2 has been reported to display anticancer properties towards several cancer cell lines. The chemical profile herein described for the ethanolic leaves extract of Bauhinia longifolia provided essential information of this Brazilian native species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We report here that the androgen receptor (AR) and ABCB1 are upregulated in a model of acquired taxol resistance (txr) in ovarian carcinoma cells. AR silencing sensitizes txr cells to taxol threefold, whereas ectopic AR expression in AR-null HEK293 cells induces resistance to taxol by 1.7-fold. AR activation using the agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or sublethal taxol treatment upregulates ABCB1 expression in both txr cells and AR-expressing HEK293 cells. In contrast, AR inactivation using the antagonist bicalutamide downregulates ABCB1 expression and enhances cytotoxicity to taxol. A functional ABCB1 promoter containing five predicted androgen-response elements (AREs) is cloned. Deletion assays reveal a taxol-responsive promoter segment which harbors ARE4. Notably, DHT- or taxol-activated AR potentiates binding of the AR to ARE4 as revealed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation. On the other hand, txr cells display an increase in chromatin remodeling. AR/H3K9ac and AR/H3K14ac complexes bind specifically to ARE4 in response to taxol. Furthermore, acetyltransferase protein levels (p300 and GCN5) are upregulated in txr cells. Silencing of p300 or GCN5 reduces chromatin modification and enhances cytotoxicity in both parental and txr SKOV3 cells. While the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) pathway is significantly activated by taxol, taxol-induced ABCB1 expression, histone posttranslational modifications, and p300 binding to ARE4 are suppressed following inhibition of the PI3K/AKT cellular pathway. These results demonstrate that the AKT/p300/AR axis can be activated to target ABCB1 gene expression in response to taxol, thus revealing a new treatment target to counter taxol resistance. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A 2-year inhalation rat and mouse cancer study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) on 1-bromopropane, a brominated solvent most commonly used as a vapor degreaser, showed significant increase in tumors in the lung of female mice and in the large intestine of male and female rats. The most sensitive endpoint was lung tumors in female mice. Mice of both sexes had hyperplasia and inflammation of the nose and showed regeneration of lung tissue. The NTP assumed that these tumors were due to genotoxic effects and that a linear dose-response relationship was appropriate. It is plausible that, similar to chloroform, hyperplasia and inflammation are required as initial events for tumor development. If true, then a threshold-based model may be more appropriate for 1-bromopropane. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day repeat dose inhalation Big Blue ® Assay was conducted using female transgenic B6C3F1 mice. The target exposure concentrations and the exposure regimen were identical to those used by the NTP. Results demonstrated no elevation in mutant frequency of the cII transgene in lung, colon, or liver. Positive controls produced statistically significant increases in mutant frequencies across all tested tissues. These results demonstrate that 1-bromopropane does not induce cII mutants in lungs, colon, or liver under the testing conditions. These data have important ramifications in the quantitative evaluation of tumor results for this chemical and support a mechanism of action where a threshold for carcinogenicity is plausible. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drugs including erlotinib cause a side effect of hypomagnesemia. In lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, anticancer agents such as cisplatin and doxorubicin dose-dependently increased toxicity, but the effects were significantly suppressed by culturing the cells in low Mg 2+ -containing media. To obtain the maximum effect in cancer chemotherapy, it should be necessary to prevent the reduction of body Mg 2+ content. Anti-EGFR drugs inhibit EGF-induced elevation of transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6) Mg 2+ channel in renal tubular epithelial NRK-52E cells. Here, we found that rosiglitazone, an antidiabetic drug, and all- trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a vitamin A derivative, increase the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of TRPM6 in the presence of erlotinib. The rosiglitazone- and ATRA-induced elevation of mRNA level, Mg 2+ influx, and promoter activity of TRPM6 were inhibited by GW-9662, a potent antagonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, and LE135, a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist, respectively. Rosiglitazone increased the phosphorylation and nuclear localization levels of PPARγ, which were inhibited by GW-9662. In contrast, RAR was mainly distributed in the nuclei under control conditions, which was unchanged by ATRA and LE135. The promoter activity of TRPM6 was inhibited by a mutation in the peroxisome proliferator hormone response element (PPRE). A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that PPARγ and RAR bind to the PPRE, which was blocked by GW-9662 and LE135, respectively. These results suggest that rosiglitazone and ATRA reverse the reduction in Mg 2+ reabsorption caused by anti-EGFR drugs. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Earlier publication from the ongoing multi-centric study of the International Agency for Research on Cancer to evaluate less than three doses of the quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in India amongst unmarried girls demonstrated non-inferior total antibody titres, neutralizing antibody titres and antibody avidity in 2-dose recipients compared to 3-dose recipients at 15–18 years of age (Bhatla et al., 2018) [7]. The number of participants recruited at 15–18 years of age was 1515 and 1795 in the 3-dose and the 2-dose groups respectively. At a median follow-up of 7 years, incident HPV 16/18 infections were detected in 1.6% women receiving two doses and 0.8% women receiving three doses at 15–18 years. Frequency of incident infection was 7.0% in the age- and site-matched unvaccinated women (N = 1484). No persistent infection from HPV 16 was observed in the 2- or 3-dose recipients and one (0.2%) persistent HPV 18 infection was documented, each in the 3-dose and 2-dose cohorts. Among the unvaccinated women, the frequency of HPV 16/18 persistent infection was 1.7%. The protection offered by two doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine against incident and persistent infections in recipients at 15–18 years is comparable to that seen in 3-dose recipients at 15–18 years. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer death worldwide. Resection offers the best chance of long-term survival, but a consistent adverse prognostic factor is the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI). In this study, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS), a high throughput method of analyzing complex samples, was used to explore differentially expressed proteins between HCC and adjacent nontumour liver tissue (ANLT). These findings were correlated with clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: From 2002 to 2011, tumor and ANLT were collected from patients who underwent liver resection and these samples were later prepared for SELDI-TOF MS. Output data were then used to identify proteins capable of discriminating HCC from ANLT. Proteins from the multivariate analysis were then analyzed to determine prognostic factors and the m/z ratios of these proteins were entered into the ExPASy database to infer potential candidates. Results: During the study period, 30 patients had SELDI-TOF MS performed on their HCC and ANLT samples. On multivariate analysis, a panel of four proteins—m/z 5840, m/z 8921, m/z 9961, and m/z 25,872—discriminated HCC from ANLT with an area under the ROC curve of 0.954 (P < 0.001). On prognostic factor assessment, decreased m/z 9961 was significantly associated with the presence of MVI (P = 0.025) and shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.045) in our patients. A potential candidate for this protein was coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, isoform 3 (CAR 3/7), which helps maintain tight junction integrity. Conclusions: Using SELDI TOF-MS, we identified a panel of four proteins with excellent discriminative capacity between HCC and ANLT. Of these, m/z 9961 was the only protein significantly associated with a known poor prognostic factor (presence of MVI) and survival (shorter disease-free survival). While loss of CAR 3/7 could lead to MVI, further research is warranted to validate the identity of protein m/z 9961. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Automatic disease classification has been one of the most intensively searched in recent years due to the possibility of quickly providing a diagnosis to the patient. In this process, the segmentation of regions of interest of these diseases has a fundamental role in their subsequent classification. With skin lesions segmentation it is no different and in recent years many studies have achieved interesting results, becoming an important tool in aiding the medical diagnosis of skin diseases. In this work, a morphological geodesic active contour segmentation (MGAC) method is proposed with automatic initialization, using mathematical morphology which is a great partial differential equation approximation, with lower computational cost, no stability problems and fully automatic. The proposed method was tested in a stable and well-known dermoscopic images database provided by Pedro Hispano Hospital (PH2) and was compared with both methods that make use of machine learning or deep learning techniques such as fully convolutional networks (FCN), full resolution convolutional networks (FrCN), deep class-specific learning with probability based step-wise integration (DCL-PSI), and others, and also traditional methods like JSEG, statistical region merging (SRM), Level Set, ASLM and others. The MGAC showed good results in all similarity metrics compared in this work like Jaccard Index (86.16%), Dice coefficient (92.09%) and Matthew correlation coefficient (87.52%), and also achieves good results in sensitivity (91.72%), specificity (97.99%), accuracy (94.59%) and F-measure (93.82%). Thus, the proposed method presented better results in relation to all these metrics when compared to the traditional methods and still presented better results in relation to the methods that use machine learning or deep learning techniques in Jaccard Index, Dice coefficient and specificity. This confirm that the MGAC can efficiently segment skin lesions, presenting great potential to be applied in the aid of the medical diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains remains a severe threat for the public health, which prompts strict restrictions on the uses of antifungal drugs. However, the majority of lipophilic fungistatic agents are poorly water soluble with a low oral adsorption characteristic posing challenges for the precise prescriptions. In this study, a natural antimicrobial cationic peptide of epsilon-poly-L-lysine (EPL) decorated ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15) was facilely prepared for the efficient loading of antifungal itraconazole (ITZ) drugs. The characterized mesoporous SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composite exhibited remarkable antifungal performance against Aspergillus fumigatus as a model mold, which was attributed to synergistic antifungal activities of ITZ and EPL in the mesopores. Moreover, the in vitro release behaviors of ITZ in the composite nanoexcipients both in simulated gastric fluid and fasted state simulated intestinal fluid were studied. The observed release kinetics of ITZ demonstrated a contributing role of SBA-15/EPL to enhance the solubility of ITZ and thereby may promote its flux across the gastrointestinal epithelium, which is beneficial for the absorption of drugs. Additionally, SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composites showed desirable biocompatibility toward mammalian red blood cells, human cervical cancer cells (Hela) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profiles of obtained nano-formulations were assessed in rats, among which the improved adsorption of SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composites (AUC 0–24h sum : 8381.7 nM·h) was identified compared with that of pure ITZ (525.1 nM·h) and the commercial drug of Sporanox (7516.6 nM·h). Collectively, the prepared SBA-15/EPL/ITZ provides an ecofriendly and integrated nanocomposite with enhanced solubility of lipophilic drugs to combat proliferations of infectious fungi. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Greener nanotechnology plays an important role in developing alternative and effective treatment strategies for various diseases. Biological synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) has known to possess suitable alternatives than the existing chemical methods. Greener synthesis of MNPs by using plant extracts has become an emerging field due to their safe, eco-friendly and non-toxic nature that are suitable for synergistic biological activities. Hence, the greener method is chosen by the present study. In the present study, the greener synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was successfully done by using Coleus aromaticus leaf extract at three different temperatures (30 °C, 60 °C and 100 °C). The formation of AuNPs was initially monitored by visual observation and then characterized with the help of diverse techniques like UV–Vis spectroscopy (UV–Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak and crystalline nature of AuNPs were obtained by UV–Vis and XRD spectroscopies respectively. FT-IR analysis shows the different characteristic functional groups in turn responsible for the bio-reduction of gold ions by using leaf extract. The formations of different nano-sized AuNPs with their different morphologies were observed by SEM and HR-TEM analyses. Surface charge and stability of the AuNPs were measured by zeta potential and DLS respectively. The synthesized AuNPs coated with cotton fabric was analyzed by UV-Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-DRS), which revealed excellent UV protection against UV radiation. The AuNPs coated cotton fabric exhibited remarkable antibacterial sensitivity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Further, the synthesized AuNPs showed significant cytotoxicity against human liver cancer (HepG2) cell line. The findings of this study revealed that, AuNPs synthesized using Coleus aromaticus leaf extract could be an alternative, safe, and effective source of UV protection, antibacterial and anticancer agents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: We performed a retrospective non-randomized study to analyze the results of microsurgery of vestibular schwannomas (VS) using 2μ-Thulium flexible hand-held laser fiber (Revolix jr®). Methods: From September 2010 to November 2018, 180 patients suffering from VS have been operated on with microsurgical technique via retrosigmoid (RS) approach in our Department. From July 2012 to April 2018, tumor resection was performed in 78 cases with the assistance of 2μ-Thulium-fiber hand-held flexible laser. Facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann (HB) scale preoperatively, 1 week postoperatively, and 6-month after surgery. Results: Overall time from incision to skin suture changed in relation to size of tumor (185–575 min) and was not affected by the use of laser. In 5 out of 78 cases preoperative facial nerve palsy HB2 and in one case HB4 (permanent) was observed. On considering 77 cases (excluding 1 permanent HB4) with a minimum 6-month follow-up, facial nerve preservation rate (HB1) was 92,2%. Hearing preservation rate (AAO-HNS A/B classes) was possible in 17 out of 30 cases (56,7%). Adopting a 0–3-scale, the mean surgeon satisfaction rate of usefulness of laser fiber was 2,75. Conclusions: The use of 2μ-Thulium-fiber hand-held flexible laser in VS-microsurgery seems to be safe and to facilitate tumor resection, especially in “difficult” conditions (e.g., highly vascularized and hard tumors). In this retrospective trial, the good functional outcome following conventional microsurgery had not further improved, nor the surgical time reduced by laser. Focusing its use on “difficult” (large and vascularized) cases may lead to different results in future. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The International Agency for Research on Cancer recently classified cured meats as carcinogenic for humans and red meats as probably carcinogenic. Mutagens can be formed during meat process or digestion. In a previous study, we used a dynamic artificial digestive system (DIDGI®) to investigate protein oxidation and N-nitrosation during bovine meat digestion. This new paper completes the previous one by focusing on the endogenous heme iron nitrosylation. Low nitrosylation due to nitrate initially present in meat and to ammonia oxidation in the stomach was observed in the digestive tract even in conditions in which no nitrite was added to the model. The endogenous addition of nitrite (1 mM) considerably increased heme iron nitrosylation while a significant decrease was observed with prior meat cooking (30 min at 60 and 90 °C). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most widespread commonly used broad-spectrum herbicides that contaminate soils and waters, are toxic to bacteria, plants and animals, and have been classified as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’ by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015. Particular soil bacteria and fungi can degrade GBHs, hence, search for new GBH-degrading strains or microbial consortia, effective under specific growth conditions and local environment, seems to be a promising solution for bio-remediation of glyphosate-contaminated environment. Consequently, there is a need for rapid and informative methods to evaluate the GBH-induced changes of the metabolic pathways in cells, that may serve as indicators of GBH-degrading potential. Three new GBH-degrading bacterial strains, Pseudomonas sp., Actinobacteria and Serratia sp. were isolated from sludge of municipal waste water treatment plant (Daugavgriva, Riga, Latvia), agricultural soil and plant tissue, respectively. This study examined the response of these isolates to elevated concentrations of glyphosate (GLP) (100 and 500 mg/L) in GBH Klinik® 360 SL. The GBH-induced shift of metabolic activity in cells of Pseudomonas sp. was shown by tests on EcoPlates™. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses were used to evaluate the metabolomic response of bacteria to elevated concentrations of GBH in the growth environment. The spectra of Pseudomonas sp. and Serratia sp., incubated with and without GBH, were similar, thus indicating their GBH-resistance. The absorption at 1736 cm −1 , assigned to ester carbonyl stretch vibrations, was detected in spectra of all three bacteria. The highest ester content was detected in Actinobacteria grown in medium with 1.0% molasses and 100 or 500 mg/L GLP in GBH Klinik®. An increase of cellular amounts of esters, either those of phospholipids or poly-β-hydroxybutyrates, indicates degradation of GLP. Therefore, monitoring the ester carbonyl stretch vibration band in FTIR spectra of bacterial biomass may speed up the search GBH-degrading strains. Microbiological tests and cell metabolic response studies by FTIR spectroscopy showed that the three new isolates of Pseudomonas sp., Actinobacteria and Serratia sp. were resistant to elevated concentrations of GBH Klinik® in growth environment and exhibited the potential for GBH degradation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "PD-L1 is critical for tumor cell escape from immune surveillance by inhibiting T cell function via the PD-1 receptor. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies might potently enhance antitumor effects in various tumors, but the effect of PD-L1 on colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains unclear. We observed high PD-L1 expression in CD133 + CD44 + colorectal CSCs and CSC-enriched tumorspheres. Altering PD-L1 expression promoted colorectal CSC self-renewal by increasing the expression of stemness genes, the CD133 + CD44 + cell population sizes and the ability to form tumorspheres. Additionally, PD-L1 expression was markedly increased in chemoresistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, PD-L1 enhanced CRC cell tumorigenicity in nude mice; the inoculation of 1 × 10 4 cells resulted in high tumor formation efficiency. Mechanistically, PD-L1 directly interacted with HMGA1, and HMGA1 upregulation by PD-L1 activated HMGA1-dependent pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, and promoted CSC expansion. HMGA1 downregulation rescued the PD-L1-induced phenotypes, highlighting the role of HMGA1 in PD-L1-mediated colorectal CSC self-renewal. Moreover, PD-L1 expression was correlated with the expression of CSC markers and HMGA1 in clinical CRC specimens. Thus, PD-L1 could crucially contribute to the maintenance of CSC self-renewal by activating HMGA1-dependent signaling pathways. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Oncogenes can potentially cause uncontrolled cell growth, leading to cancer development, and these genes are normally mutated and over-expressed in tumor cells. Genomic alteration of oncogenes might result in oncogenesis and promotion of cancer progression. To date, researchers have focused mainly on the roles of oncogenes in particular cancers, but investigation of oncogenes with gain-of-function mutations in multiple cancer types are less represented in the literature. Furthermore, the effect of those gain-of-function are not validated in gene expression level. To meet this demand, we performed a systematic analysis of gene expression in oncogenes to identify the occurrence of gain-of-function mutations in pan-cancer. We identified 33,551 oncogenic mutations in 5000 samples. From our analysis, we identified three tissues with the highest frequency of gain-of-functional oncogenic mutations in hundreds of samples: breast (739 samples), central nervous system (646 samples) and large intestine (498 samples). By further counting the number of occurrences of oncogenes across cancer types, we identified a list cross-cancer mutational signatures of 99 oncogenes highly mutated in >400 samples in breast, central nervous system and large intestine samples. By further overlapping with gene expression data in the matched tumor samples, we further identified 1875 gain-of-functional mutations/events with consistent gene up-regulation in 1031 samples from multiple cancers. This result may offer additional insight into the relationship between gene dosage and oncogenesis and maybe useful in targeted cancer therapy. In summary, this study provides the first globally examining on the genetic alteration of oncogenes across cancer types. Clinical association analysis has shown that these 99 genes have a significant effect on survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate the impact of miR-451 on the biological behaviours of colon cancer cells along with its targets interactions. Method: The levels of miR-451 were tested in colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW48). Multiple functional and immunological assays were performed to analyse miR-451 induced growth changes in-vitro and downstream effects on target proteins. Results: Overexpression of miR-451 in colon cancer cells led to reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and decrease accumulation of the cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, a significant increase in the number of the cells was noted in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. Moreover, miR-451 reduced the expression of Oct-4, Sox-2 and Snail indicating its role in stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation. An inverse correlation between miR-451 and macrophage migration inhibitory protein (MIF) protein expression occurred in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, restoration the level of miR-451 in colon cancer cells inhibits tumour spheres formation. Conclusion: miR-451 has tumour suppressor effects in vitro, which can inhibit the cancer-related signalling pathways in colon cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The microRNAs (miRNAs) have been validated as prognostic markers in many cancers. The aim of this study was to identify new miRNA prognostic biomarkers in endometrial cancer (EC) and to develop an expression-based miRNA signature to provide survival risk prediction for EC patients. Methods: From TCGA database, the miRNA datasets of EC and clinical information were downloaded in April 2018. Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identify prognostic factors. Using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assess the sensitivity and specificity of prognostic model. Results: 530 patients were randomly divided into training set and testing set. Among 561 differentially expressed miRNAs, 4 miRNAs (miR-4758, miR-876, miR-142, miR-190b) were demonstrated to be predictive biomarkers of overall survival (OS) for EC patients in training set. Based on the risk score of 4-miRNA model, patients in the training set were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different OS. This 4-miRNA model was validated in testing and entire set. The AUC for the ROC curves in the entire set was 0.704. Meanwhile, multivariate Cox regression combined with other traditional clinical parameters indicated that the 4-miRNA model can be used as an independent OS prognostic factor. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these miRNAs are involved in biological processes and pathways that are closely related to cancer. Conclusion: A robust 4-miRNA signature as an independent prognostic factor for OS in EC patients was established. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Curcumin (CUR) is a natural active ingredient that attracted much attention for its chemotherapeutic activity against tumors without causing toxicity in healthy cells. However, it has certain limitations for being used in chemotherapy such as low aqueous solubility and hydrolytic instability in the physiological environment. In this study, self-assembled poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-grafted gelatin (Gel-mPEG) nanogels were fabricated as delivery systems to improve the applicability of CUR in cancer treatment. CUR-loaded Gel-mPEG nanogels exhibited desired size range, relatively colloidal stability, and provided enhanced CUR stability in aqueous solutions. Especially, they showed significant high CUR loading capacity and better anticancer activity than free CUR as compared to previously reported CUR-loaded nanogels according to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the in vitro release of CUR from the nanogels was controlled and prolonged up to 96 h. These results demonstrated that Gel-mPEG nanogels are the promising modality for the efficient delivery of CUR in cancer treatment. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

    "Abstract": "In the present study, NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 and/or Hsp-27 inhibitor KRIBB-3 agents were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating androgen receptor expression on prostate cancer cell lines. The decrease observed in androgen receptor and p65 expressions, particularly at 48 h, in parallel with the decrease in the phosphorylation of the p-IKK α/β and p-Hsp-27 proteins in the LNCaP cells, indicated that androgen receptor inactivation occurred after the inhibition of the NF-κB and Hsp-27. In 22Rv1 cells, androgen receptor variant-7 was also observed to be decreased in the combined dose of 48 h. The association of this decrease with the decrease in androgen receptor and p65 expressions is a supportive result for the role of NF-κB signaling in the formation of androgen receptor variant. In androgen receptor variant-7 siRNA treatment in 22Rv1 cell lines, decrease of expression of androgen receptor variant-7 as well as decrease of expression of androgen receptor and p65 were observed. The decrease statistically significant in androgen receptor and p65 expressions was even greater when siRNA treatment was followed with low dose and time (6 h) combined treatment after transfection. We also showed that increased Noxa and decreased Bcl-2 protein level, indicated that apoptotic induction after this combination. In conclusion, inhibition of NF-κB and Hsp-27 is also important, along with therapies for androgen receptor variant-7 inhibition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The pathogenesis and the underlying mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. LncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is an oncogene in a variety of cancers. The role of PVT1 in HCC progression is not completely understood. In the present study, we conducted a series of studies to explore the role of PVT1 on autophagy in HCC cells. Our study found PVT1 levels were markedly up-regulated in the corresponding HCC tissues. Importantly, we found that PVT1 could facilitate cell autophagy in HCC cells. Then, we confirmed that the effect of PVT1 promoting autophagy was dependent on regulating ATG3 expression. Further investigations revealed that PVT1 could upregulate autophagy-related gene 3 (ATG3) expression by acting as an endogenous sponge of miR-365, which was an inhibitor gene on ATG3 protein by targeting 3′UTR of ATG3 mRNA. Moreover, rescue assays indicated that the effect of PVT1 on autophagy of HCC cells were dependent on miR-365. In conclusion, our study demonstrated PVT1 might be a key regulator participating in autophagy in HCC cells. We proved that PVT1 could promote autophagy as ceRNA by targeting miR-365. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this article, an improved synthesis strategy of the potent anticancer compound 4,7-dichloro-2-quinolinemethanol (QM) and its acrylate ester 4,7-dichloro-2-quinolinemethylacrylate (AQM) are described. AQM is copolymerized using free-radical polymerization with N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (VP) and the copolymers obtained from different molar ratios of monomers are subjected to nanoprecipitation to produce suspensions of nanoparticles (NPs) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The smallest and stable NPs are prepared with the AQM-VP copolymers 45:55 and 40:60 (118.9 and 128.7 nm in diameter, respectively) at 1 mg mL −1 , and along with AQM and QM, are evaluated for their cytotoxic activity on MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cells using MTT bioassay. AQM and QM are highly cytotoxic (IC 50 : 19 and 41 μM, respectively); however, the NPs are not cytotoxic in the range of the assayed concentrations. These results contribute to the search for new polymeric NPs with potential application as QM delivery systems for the treatment of cancer or other diseases treatable with QM. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "Abstract": "It is well known that children treated for cancer are at risk for cognitive and functional impairments. Such research is largely based on studies of late effects in school-aged or older children. However, far less is known about executive function weaknesses in preschool-aged children treated for cancer. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine executive functioning in a clinically referred sample of young oncology patients, and its association with broader domains of functioning. Data from 61 young children with cancer, who were referred for clinical cognitive evaluations, were abstracted and included in this study. Patients were 5.00 years of age (SD = 0.72) at assessment, 54.1% male, and two-thirds (63.9%) had been treated for brain tumors. Most executive functions were significantly discrepant from the mean, with 47.5% of preschoolers having parent-reported working memory concerns within the clinically significant range. There were no differences in executive functioning based on diagnosis or treatment status. Parent-reported executive functioning was strongly correlated with global intelligence and adaptive functioning, with some indices also associated with nonverbal problem solving and pre-academic skills. Ultimately, results indicate the presence of emerging weaknesses in executive functioning in young children with cancer, and add to a growing body of literature highlighting the potential cognitive and behavioral risks associated with a cancer diagnosis in early childhood. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "The excellent anticancer effect of combined differential cancer therapies has been observed in the last few decades. Efficient theragnostic nanoparticles (NPs) for malignancy treatment have received considerable research attention and widely investigated today. This study presents our results on the development of aptamer-functionalized Fe 3 O 4 @carbon@doxorubicin NPs (Apt-Fe 3 O 4 @C@DOX) and their application in the synergetic chemo–photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer. The Apt-Fe 3 O 4 @C@DOX NPs displayed high photothermal conversion efficiency and extensive pH/heat-induced drug release. In vitro (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium) bromide experiments indicated that the combined chemo–PTT is much more toxic toward lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) than PTT or chemotherapy alone. In addition, the Apt-Fe 3 O 4 @C@DOX NPs demonstrated decreasing contrast enhancement of magnetic resonance (MR) signals, which means they may be potentially applied as a contrast agent and serve as a critical component of T 2 -weighted MR imaging of tumor tissues. Taking the results together, the Apt-Fe 3 O 4 @C@DOX NPs show great potential for cancer therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We report results of the studies relating to the fabrication of a label-free, flexible, light weight and disposable conducting paper based immunosensing platform comprising of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) and nanostructured iron oxide (nFe 2 O 3 @PEDOT:PSS) nanocomposite for detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a cancer biomarker. The effect of various solvents such as sorbitol, ethanol, propanol, n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the electrical conductivity of Whatman filter paper (WP) modified with nFe 2 O 3 @PEDOT:PSS/WP was investigated. The electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS/WP electrode was found to be enhanced by two orders of magnitude (from 6.8× 10 −4 to 1.92 × 10 −2 Scm −1 ) after its treatment with DMSO. Further, nFe 2 O 3 doped PEDOT:PSS/WP electrode exhibited the electrical conductivity as 2.4 × 10 −2 Scm −1 . Besides this, the incorporation of iron oxide nanoparticles (nFe 2 O 3 ) into PEDOT:PSS/WP resulted in improved electrochemical performance and signal stability. This nFe 2 O 3 @PEDOT:PSS/WP based platform was used for immobilization of the anti-carcinoembronic antigen (anti-CEA) protein for quantitative estimation of cancer biomarker (CEA). The results of electrochemical response studies revealed that this conducting paper based immunoelectrode had a sensitivity of 10.2 μAng −1 mLcm −2 in the physiological range (4–25 ngmL −1 ) and shelf life of 34 days. Further, the proposed immunoelectrode was validated with conventional ELISA for the detection of CEA in serum samples of cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "MiR-515-5p has been suggested to function as tumor suppressor in various human cancers. However, the role of miR-515-5p in prostate cancer was still unclear. In this study, we observed miR-515-5p expression was reduced in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal prostatic tissues and normal human prostate epithelial cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, we found miR-515-5p was negatively correlated with TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer tissue samples, and miR-515-5p directly targeted TRIP13 3′-UTR and negatively regulated TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, miR-515-5p acted as a tumor suppressor to regulate cell proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting TRIP13 in prostate cancer. Besides, we observed that miR-515-5p expression in prostate cancer patients with advanced T stage subgroup or high Gleason score was significantly lower than its expression in prostate cancer patients with early T stage or low Gleason score. Survival analysis suggested that prostate cancer cases with high miR-515-5p expression had better prognosis than prostate cancer cases with low miR-515-5p expression. In conclusion, our study highlights the clinical and biological role of miR-515-5p as tumor suppressive microRNA in prostate cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We demonstrate high-sensitivity detection of metastatic breast cancer cells using terahertz (THz) chemical microscopy (TCM) with aptamers as ligands. For the aptamers, we use previously developed synthetic single stranded (ss) DNA aptamers mammaglobin B1 (MAMB1) and mammaglobin A2 (MAMA2) that bind to mammaglobin B and mammaglobin A proteins, respectively, which are overexpressed on the surface of MCF7 and MDA-MB-415 breast cancer cells. Each aptamer was immobilized on the surface of a sensing plate, and the amplitude of the THz signal was measured upon the binding of each aptamer to different number (10–10 6 ) of its target breast cancer cells. A change in the THz amplitude was observed when MAMB1 and MAMA2 bind to MCF7 and MDA-MB-415, respectively. We find that this change was linear as a function of the log number of breast cancer cells used. No change in the THz amplitude was observed when the same number of normal breast cells (MCF 10A) were used. Moreover, MAMB1 and MAMA2 did not show binding to the counter breast cancer cells, indicating high selectivity. We have demonstrated that the TCM using aptamers as ligands has a limit of detection as small as 1 breast cancer cell in 100 μL of sample. Results described here indicate that the TCM could be a powerful tool to detect metastatic breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the expression of the lncRNA ZFAS1 in cervical cancer and its relationship with patient prognosis and cervical cancer cell chemosensitivity. Methods: The expression of ZFAS1 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. The cervical cancer CaSki and the HeLa cell lines were transfected to be divided into Blank, siR-Control, and siR-ZFAS1 groups. MTT, wound-healing, and transwell assays were used to evaluate cell biological function. Cisplatin with different concentrations was used to treat cells in different transfection groups, and MTT assays were used to detect the cell growth inhibition rate and the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin was measured. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. A xenograft mouse model was used to investigate the effects of siR-ZFAS1 on the chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Results: ZFAS1 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, and increased ZFAS1 levels led to poor prognoses in patients. In addition, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group showed remarkably reduced ZFAS1 expression as well as cell proliferation, invasion and migration. After being treated with cisplatin at different concentrations, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group had dramatically increased cell growth inhibition and apoptosis but lower cisplatin IC50s. In addition, siR-ZFAS1 reduced the volumes and weights of tumors in nude mice treated with cisplatin and enhanced the chemosensitivity of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin. Conclusion: The lncRNA ZFAS1 was upregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and its high expression indicated a poor prognosis. Silencing ZFAS1 may inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion and enhance cisplatin chemosensitivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Chemo-photothermal combination therapy is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In this study, to achieve the combined photothermal-chemotherapy of breast cancer, a pH-sensitive oxidized hyaluronic acid-decorated dihydroxyphenyl/hydrazide bifunctionalized hydroxyethyl chitosan (DHHC)-gold nanorod (GNR) conjugate was developed. DHHC was synthesized by successive dihydroxyphenylation and hydrazidation of hydroxyethyl chitosan through carbodiimide reaction and click chemistry, respectively. The conjugate was obtained by chemically bonding DHHC onto GNR via Au-catechol bonds. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto the conjugate via an acid-labile hydrazone linkage with a drug loading content of 5.1%. DOX-loaded conjugate displayed good stability in neutral aqueous solutions and exhibited pH-responsive drug release and surface charge reversal behaviors. In vitro biological studies indicated that the conjugate could be effectively internalized by breast cancer MCF-7 cells and synergistic therapeutic effects were demonstrated, suggesting its great potential in combined photothermal-chemotherapy of breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Anterior gradient protein 2 homolog (AGR) is a potential tumor biomarker and plays an important role in tissue development and regeneration. The intracellular detection of AGR is rarely reported. By conjugating the AGR aptamer with a cytosine base sequence as Ag cluster template, a highly fluorescent probe (MA@AgNCs) was synthesized for targeting intracellular AGR. The MA@AgNCs display a maximum fluorescence peak at 565 nm, and possess an excellent quantum yield (QY = 87.43%), small size, great biocompatibility, low toxicity, and good stability. Moreover, the as synthesized MA@AgNCs show high specificity on recognizing breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Triptolide, the component of traditional Chinese herb, has been used as an inflammatory medicine and reported to be anti-tumor for various cancers recently. However, the effect of triptolide on Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer (ESCC) has not yet been elucidated. In the study, we found that triptolide significantly inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, migration and survivability of ESCC cells. Moreover, we observed that triptolide induced ESCC cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase and apoptosis through cyclin D1-CDK4/6 regulation and caspases activation. In addition, we revealed that triptolide regulates cell apoptosis and metastasis by p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway, respectively. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effect of triptolide on ESCC was validated in mouse xenograft model. So, we propose that triptolide may be a candidate drug for ESCC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapy is currently regarded as the most promising treatment to fight against cancer. This is particularly true in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an indolent neoplastic disease of B-lymphocytes which eventually causes the immune system's failure. In this and other areas of cancer research, mathematical modeling is pointed out as a prominent tool to analyze theoretical and practical issues. Its lack in studies of chemoimmunotherapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is what motivated us to come up with a simple ordinary differential equation model. It is based on ideas of de Pillis and Radunskaya and on standard pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics assumptions. In order to check the positivity of the state variables, we first establish an invariant region where these time-dependent variables remain positive. Afterwards, the action of the immune system, as well as the chemoimmunotherapeutic role in promoting cancer cure are investigated by means of numerical simulations and the classical linear stability analysis. The role of adoptive cellular immunotherapy is also addressed. Our overall conclusion is that chemoimmunotherapeutic protocols can be effective in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia provided that chemotherapy is not a limiting factor to the immunotherapy efficacy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A 1,6-α-D-glucan (CPA) with a high molecular weight of 2.0 × 10 3 kDa was isolated from the fruits of Castanea mollissima Blume. CPA showed good water solubility, low side effects on normal cells, and moderate cytotoxicity on cancer cells. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) possess significant anticancer effects, but poor water solubility and dispersity. Therefore, an effective nanocomposite was designed in order to enhance the stability and anticancer effects of SeNPs decorated with CPA. Water soluble and dispersed selenium nanoparticles (CPA-SeNPs) were fabricated using CPA and Na 2 SeO 3 by redox reaction with ascorbic acid. The average diameter of CPA-SeNPs was 53.7 ± 4.0 with a Se content of approximately 171.4 mg/g. CPA-SeNPs showed a significant anti-proliferative effect on HeLa cells in vitro. Since these NPs could induce apoptosis and S phase arrest. The apoptotic pathway triggered by CPA-SeNPs on HeLa cells was also characterized as induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3. This study suggested that CPA-SeNPs could be developed as a potential candidate in cancer treatment, especially against human cervical cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Dioxins (PCDDs), furans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) emitted into the environment can accumulate in foods and become a significant source of dietary exposure for consumers of these compounds. This study aims to assess the dietary exposure of the residents in a rural area of the Silesia region in southern Poland to PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs. The goal is to estimate cancer and non-cancer health risks due to the consumption of foods of animal origin. The area has relatively higher concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in the air in comparison to large industrialized cities of the Silesia province. Three popular foods of animal origin, namely free-range chicken meat, free-range chicken eggs, and cow milk produced in the farms were used. The control samples were the same foods from the local grocery stores. Two exposure scenarios were considered: Firstly that residents consumed free-range foods and secondly that the food items were purchased from stores in the study area. In the first scenario, exposure to concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) yielded evidence of elevated cancer and non-cancer risks. The hazard quotient (HQ) was 71.3 for non-cancer risk and 7.5 × 10 −3 for cancer risk. The health risk from exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs in the second scenario was 6.9 × 10 −4 and HQ = 0.8, respectively. Implementation of educational activities in the study area is needed to increase the resident's awareness of the risks associated with the emissions of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants to the environment, including aspects such as the main sources of the emission and how to avoid exposure to these compounds. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: As one broader class of non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), non-coding antisense (AS) transcripts are functionally characterized to play pivotal roles in various pathophysiological processes, including tumor biology. Methods: In this study, the exact biological functions and regulation mechanisms of GAS6-AS1 in gastric cancer (GC) was examined. Results: The expression of GAS6-AS1 was markedly upregulated in GC tissues and is associated with advanced stage (III + IV) of GC patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that GAS6-AS1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion ability in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo by promoting entry into S-phase. The mechanistic investigations showed that GAS6-AS1 can control the expression of its cognate sense gene GAS6 at the transcriptional or translational levels by forming a RNA-RNA duplex, consequently inducing an increase of AXL level and driveling AXL signaling pathway activation. Conclusions: Taken together, our studies indicate that GAS6-AS1 significantly driving the aggressive phenotype in GC through activating its cognate sense gene GAS6, and provides a more complete understanding of GAS6-AS1 as a potential therapeutic target for GC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Sarcosine, a potential biomarker for prostate cancer, can be detected in a solid state enzyme based biosensor using sarcosine oxidase, with particle immobilised reagents. A novel fusion protein of the fluorescent protein, mCherry, sarcosine oxidase (SOx), and the polypeptide R5 (R5 2 -mCherry-SOx-R5-6 H), was explored, which allowed self-immobilization on silica microparticles and long-term (90 days +) retention of activity, even at room temperature. In contrast, commercial wildtype SOx lost activity in a few days. A silica-R5 2 -mCherry-SOx-R5-6H microparticle sensor for determination of sarcosine in urine, linked the SOx coproduct, H 2 O 2 , to a measurement catalysed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immobilised on silica, in the presence of Amplex Ultrared (AR) to generate fluorescence at 582 nm. Silica microparticles carrying all the reagents (R5 2 -mCherry-SOx-R5-6H, HRP and AR) were used to produce a silica-microparticle biosensor which responded to sarcosine at micromolar levels. Interference by amino acids and uric acid was examined and it was found that the silica-reagent carrying system could be calibrated in urine and responded across the clinically relevant concentration range. This contrasted with similar assays using commercial SOx, where interference inhibited the sarcosine signal measurement in urine. The microparticle biosensor was tested in urine from healthy volunteers and prostate cancer patients, showing higher concentrations of sarcosine in cancer patients consistent with previous reports of elevated sarcosine levels. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in tumor biology. To date, some lncRNAs have been found to be involved in competitive binding of miRNAs, a major group of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), through participation in a regulatory network of protein-coding gene expression. However, the functional roles of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have rarely been reported. Here, we construct a hypothetical ceRNA network by analyzing differential expression of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs obtained from 96 ESCC tissues and 13 normal tissues in the Cancer Genome Atlas. Ultimately, 95 lncRNAs, 9 miRNAs, and 40 mRNAs were identified (fold change >1.5, P < .05) and included in the ceRNA network for ESCC. Moreover, three lncRNAs (IGF2-AS, MUC2 and SOX2-OT) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (log-rank test, P < .05), and further experiments revealed that lncRNA DLX6-AS1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and invasion of esophageal cancer cells by enhancing the endogenous function of mTOR. We believe that the identified ceRNA network can facilitate a better understanding of lncRNA-related mechanisms in ESCC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cancer diagnosis based on serum biomarkers requires receptors of extreme sensitivity and selectivity. Tunability of aptamer selection makes them ideal for that challenge. However, aptamer characterization is a time-consuming task, not always thoroughly addressed, leading to suboptimal aptamer performance. In this work, we report on the affinity characterization and potential usage of two aptamers against a candidate cancer biomarker, the neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL). Electrochemical sandwich assays on Au electrodes and SPR experiments showed a restricted capture ability of one of the aptamers (LCN2–4) and a small detectability of the other (LCN2-2). Interestingly, a truncated version of the signaling aptamer LCN2-2 selectively binds to NGAL covalently linked to magnetic beads due to high local protein concentration. The functional affinity of this aptamer is enhanced by three-orders of magnitude using rolling circle amplification (RCA), completed in only 15 min, followed by hybridization with short complementary fluorescein-tag probes, enzyme labeling and chronoamperometric measurement. Microscale thermophoresis experiments show a poor affinity for the protein in solution, which urges the importance of a full and in-depth characterization of aptamers to be used as diagnostic reagents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Peroxynitrite (ONOO - ) is an important reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can react with a variety of biologically active species and cause many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders. Herein, we develop a novel far-red fluorescent probe DCM-KA, which is equipping with α-ketoamide moiety caged DCM-NH 2 . The probe exhibits fluorescence off-on response to ONOO - over other biological interfering analytes by ONOO - -induced α-ketoamide deprotection reaction. More importantly, the probe is biocompatible and has been successfully utilized to visualize endogenous ONOO - production in macrophage cell line J774A.1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A microenvironment-sensitive probe SCD is developed with a thiol-activated functional group, which could identify specific proteins containing free cysteine residues, such as human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and β-lactoglobulin. The probe displays good selectivity and sensitivity toward thiol-containing proteins over other proteins, ions, and amino acids under physiological conditions. Due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer property, SCD exhibits a fluorescence “turn-on” which is utilized for the quantitative detection of trace HSA contents in urine and serum media for the assessment of kidney function and diagnosis of renal diseases. Furthermore, SCD realizes HSA imaging in human breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Funding Text 1": "In summary, a fluorescent probe SCD, immobilized with a thiol-active functional group, was developed for sensing proteins with free cysteine residue ( e.g. HSA), which can be applied to recognize HSA in practical urine and serum samples with excellent selectivity and sensitivity. In addition, SCD could serve as a good candidate for imaging exogenous HSA in living cells. Due to the superior performance, we expect SCD a possible agent for the diagnosis of thiol-containing proteins-related diseases in the future.

    "Abstract": "Adenosine is closely related to the development of cancer, and it can be regarded as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Here, a T7 exonuclease (T7 Exo)-assisted and target-triggered cascade dual recycling signal amplification strategy was developed for the sensitive and specific detection of adenosine. In this strategy, a capture strand (Cap)-inhibit strand (Inh) duplex and a DNA hairpin with intact G-quadruplex sequence are designed. In the presence of adenosine, Cap binds with adenosine specifically to form Cap-adenosine complex with recessed 5′-hydroxyl termini, causing the release of Inh. Under the action of T7 Exo, the adenosine is released from Cap-adenosine complex. Then the released adenosine interacts with the next Cap-Inh duplex to promote the release of a new Inh and the recycle I is completed. After that, the released Inh hybridizes with hairpin to form Inh-hairpin duplex with blunt 5′ -hydroxyl termini. Under the same action of T7 Exo, the Inh gets released and a G-quadruplex sequence is obtained. Subsequently, the released Inh continues opening hairpin and the recycle II is accomplished. Finally, plenty of G-quadruplex sequences are generated and then interact with N-methyl-mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) to obtain enhanced fluorescence signal. The limit of detection (LOD) of the proposed strategy is estimated to be 9.8 × 10 −7 mol L −1 , and the linear range of the strategy is from 5.0 × 10 −6 mol L −1 to 7.0 × 10 −4 mol L −1 . Besides, the proposed strategy is capable of distinguishing adenosine from its analogues. This strategy holds promise in adenosine related biomedical research, clinical diagnosis and disease treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The simultaneous quantitative analysis of intracellular metabolic coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) is of interest because they participate in many electron-transfer reactions of metabolism. But, the simultaneous quantitative analysis of FAD and FMN is hard to be achieved by traditional analytical methods. This paper proposes a novel strategy of intrinsic fluorescence coupled with four-way calibration method for simultaneous quantitative analysis of intracellular metabolic coenzymes FAD and FMN. Through mathematical separation, this proposed analytical method efficiently achieved the simultaneous quantitative analysis of metabolic coenzymes FAD and FMN in the cell, despite the fact that uncalibrated spectral interferents coexist in the system. The predicted concentrations of FAD and FMN in the cell are 217.0 ± 6.9 and 155.0 ± 1.7 pmol/10 6 cells respectively, which were validated by the approved liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. This analytical method with second-order advantage simply requires the cell solution to be diluted by a buffer, it could introduce an interesting analytical strategy for multianalyte direct quantitative analysis in complex biological systems. In addition, we explore the third-order advantage of four-way calibration by a comparative study based on this real fluorescence data. The comparisons indicate that a four-way calibration method can provide higher sensitivity and more resolving power than a three-way calibration method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hypochlorous acid (HOCl), on the one hand they can regulate physiological function in our living organisms, on the other hand abnormal concentration of ROS would induce a series of biomacromolecules damage and further endanger virtually all aspects of human health. Especially it can be directly related to cancer. Thus to elucidate and visualize their concentration is very imminent. Before many fluorescent probes were used to detect HOCl. In recent years, near-infrared or ratiometric fluorescent developed prosperously. The strategy of combining near-infrared and ratiometric fluorescent probe is overwhelming in the design of fluorescent probes. In this work, we successfully designed and obtained a near-infrared and ratiometric fluorescent probe with large stokes by reacting isophorone with coumarin, which can monitor HOCl high efficiently with quick response and low detection limit. In addition, cell imaging experiments show that the probe can identify endogenous and exogenous ClO − successfully, and nude mouse imaging experiments show that the probe can detect exogenous ClO − . It is possible that the probe can be applied in early clinical diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The experimental (FT-IR and Laser-Raman spectra) and theoretical (DFT studies) vibrational modes of (E)-N′-Hydroxy-1,3-diphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-5-carboximidamide were studied in detail. FT-IR and Laser-Raman data were collected in the range 4000-400 cm −1 and 4000-100 cm −1 , respectively in solid phase. Optimized structural parameters and frequency values were theoretically calculated using DFT/B3LYP and DFT/M06-2X chemical methods with 6–311++G (d,p) basis set by Gaussian 09W software. Theoretical frequency assignments and potential energy distributions (PED) analysis were performed by VEDA 4 program. With the optimized structures, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies and clouds were obtained and evaluated. Additionally, molecular docking studies for potent pyruvate kinase activators (PDB codes: 4RPP, 4FXJ, 4QG6, 4WJ8) and previously used targets (PDB codes: 2QU5, 2W1G and 2VTO-three different cancers related proteins) were employed for docking by AutoDock Vina program considering Swiss-Target reports and related literature knowledge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in cancer development. Several studies have indicated that miRNAs mediate tumorigenesis processes, such as inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of the microRNA-185 (miR-185) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma (OS). MiR-185 expression was reduced in OS tissues and OS cell lines. MiR-185 inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase assay validated that vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) was a direct target of miR-185. Overexpression of miR-185 in OC cells reduced VAMP2 expression in protein and mRNA levels, whereas suppression of miR-185 led to an increase in VAMP2 protein and mRNA levels. In addition, we found that VAMP2 silencing inhibited the OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Further studies verified that introducing VAMP2 mRNA into cells over-expressing miR-185 abrogated the effects of miR-185 on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Therefore, these results confirm that decreased expression of miR-185 might be regarded as a tumor marker for the early diagnosis of OS, by manipulating of its interactive factors with VAMP2, to provide an effective novel therapeutic target for treatment of the OS tumor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The ferrocene-hormone conjugate 16-ferrocenylidene-17β-estra-1,3,5-triene-3,17-diol crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell, space group P2 1 . The asymmetric unit cell contains two ferrocene-hormone conjugates, co-crystallized with two water and one acetonitrile molecules. The crystal structure shows a hydrogen bonding network within the hormone residues and the co-crystallized water and acetonitrile molecules. Hirshfeld surface and two-dimensional fingerprint plots were performed for each of the ferrocene-hormone conjugates in order to analyse weak intermolecular contacts. Particular attention is placed on hydrogen bond interactions in the crystal structure. A noncovalent OH-π intermolecular interaction was found in the crystal structure. DFT studies were employed using the long-range functional ωB97XD and 6–311 g** basis set to study such interactions. The existence of this OH-π intermolecular interaction contributes with −2.32 kcal/mol to the total energy of the crystalline structure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Previous study has shown heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1(HNRNPA1) is highly expressed in various human cancers. In order to study the clinical value and potential function of HNRNPA1 in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), three datasets from the GEPIA, GEO and TCGA were analyzed. HNRNPA1 expression was found to be significantly higher in HBV-positive HCC samples, which was supported with IHC validation. Both GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that HNRNPA1 co-expressed genes were involved in translation, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis and assembly, ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, RNA splicing, etc. Survival analysis showed a significant reduction in overall survival of patients with high HNRNPA1 expression from both the GSE14520 cohort and 151 patients with HBV-related HCC cohort. Furthermore, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that HNRNPA1 may regulate HCC progression by influencing the cell cycle and WNT signaling pathway, etc. HNRNPA1 overexpression has diagnostic value in distinguishing between HCC and non-HCC liver tissue (AUC = 0.730). Finally, HNRNPA1 was a directly target gene of miR-22 manifested by the reduced luciferase activity and decreased HNRNPA1 expression in the cells with overexpression of miR-22. HNRNPA1 might function as an oncogene through the EGFR signaling pathway in HBV-related HCC, which has not been reported in previous studies. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Niclosamide, previously used as an anthelmintic drug is currently being repurposed for its anticancer activity. Niclosamide is a brick like biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) class II drug with poor aqueous solubility and dissolution consequently leading to low bioavailability. By considering the physicochemical properties and geometry of niclosamide, inclusion complex with cyclodextrin was prepared by freeze drying method and characterized using FT-IR, DSC, PXRD, and 1 HNMR. In silico molecular modeling study was performed to study the possible interactions between niclosamide and cyclodextrin. The anticancer activity of niclosamide formulation was evaluated through in vitro cell cytotoxicity study using various cancer cell lines. The potential of niclosamide complex for improvement of the bioavailability was evaluated in male BALB/c mice. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated significantly higher cytotoxicity at lower concentrations and the pharmacokinetic studies showed significant improvement in C max and T max of niclosamide from cyclodextrin complex in comparison to pure niclosamide alone. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptide LL-37 is ubiquitously expressed and secreted by epithelial cells of mucosal surfaces including the gastrointestinal tract, the primary absorption site of orally administered drugs and food components. Besides antimicrobial properties, LL-37 also contributes to the pathophysiology of various diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and cancer. Non-covalent association of antiinflammatory drugs, porphyrin pigments, bile salts and food dyes to the peptide was uncovered and evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. These agents induce the disorder-to-order conformational transition of the natively unstructured LL-37 leading to its helical folding. Even in the presence of chloride ions, when LL-37 is partially folded, the inducers were able to rise the α-helix content. CD titration data indicated positive cooperativity between the ligand molecules accommodated to the peptide chain resulting in multimeric complexes with apparent dissociation constants ranged from 2 to 500 μM. Computational docking suggested the prominent role of the Lys8-Arg19 segment in the accommodation of small molecules, governed principally by salt bridges and H-bonding. Since pleiotropic biological functions of LL-37 are strongly conformation-dependent, it could be anticipated that folding inducer compounds may modulate its in vivo actions and also of related cationic peptides. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BRAF V600E mutation is an important drive gene mutation and biomarker for tumor diagnosis, monitoring and target treatment. In order to meet the needs of identifying low abundance BRAF V600E mutation from real clinical specimens, a real time fluorescent biosensing strategy was developed by perfectly integrating dual padlock-gap-ligase chain reaction (DP-gLCR) with hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA). A pair of padlock probes was designed to induce DP-gLCR by using single-base gap coupling with matched deoxyribonucleotides substrates, which significantly increased the specificity of mutation discrimination. A large amount of circularized padlock probes were produced and triggered subsequent HRCA, generating numerous dendritic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) products for highly sensitive real time fluorescent biosensing. The designed biosensing strategy could detect as low as 200 zM mutation target and distinguish as low as 0.01% genomic DNA with B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) V600E mutation in 40 ng wild-type genomic DNA, which was equal to almost one copy of mutant genomic DNA. Moreover, the proposed method was successfully applied in the detection of BRAF V600E mutation from real clinical samples, proving great potential for ultrasensitive biosensing of low abundance somatic mutation for early cancer diagnosis and treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Typically, sialic acids (SA) with a nine-carbon backbone are found at the glycan chain termini on the cell membranes, which play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. The expression level of SA in the blood serum has been reported to correlate with various disease states among cancer. In this study, a novel approach for preparing fluorescent boronic-acid-modified carbon dots (C-dots) for the detection of SA was developed. The functionalized C-dots were synthesized by a facile, one-step hydrothermal method using 3-pyridineboronic acid as the sole carbon source. The added SA selectively recognized the C-dots, leading to the fluorescence quenching of the C-dots in a linear range of 80–4000 μM with a detection limit of 54 μM. The as-developed boronic-acid nanoprobe was successfully applied for the detection of SA in human serum samples with satisfactory results. In addition, this method afforded results within 4 min. Compared to other methods, this new proposed approach was simpler and exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity, demonstrating immense potential as an alternative for SA detection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This work reports a novel approach to monitor Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) biomarker with molecular-imprinting technology assembled on a conductive glass surface. For this purpose, the polymerization was achieved by electrical stimulus on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-glass modified with a homemade carbon ink (hCCI). The biomimetic material was assembled on top of this surface, by moulding CEA at the molecular level around a polyaminophenol (PAP) polymeric matrix. The CEA biomarker was previously incubated in the presence or not of aminophenylboronic acid (APBA), to evaluate the effect of negative charges at the rebinding site. Then, aminophenol (AP) monomer was electropolymerized on the modified FTO glass, acting as working electrode. The template was removed by enzymatic action. Likewise, a control material having only PAP and no CEA was also prepared. The resulting sensing films were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the chemical modifications on these after each stage of the assembly process was followed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies. Imprinted devices displayed good linear responses to CEA in EIS assays from 2.5 ng/mL to 1.5 μg/mL in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). A promising detection of CEA was, also, achieved in spiked foetal bovine serum (FBS) samples, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3 ng/mL. Overall, the devices developed herein are promising tools for monitoring CEA in point-of-care (POC) applications, being able to detect lower concentrations than those in normal physiological levels. In addition, the biosensors offer low cost, high sensitivity and good selectivity, and may be used to couple to other reading devices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug that often causes acute kidney injury (AKI) in cancer patients. The contribution of miRNAs to the cisplatin-induced renal tubular epithelial cell injury remains largely unknown. Here we performed an integrative network analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles to shed light into the underlying mechanism of cisplatin-induced renal tubular epithelial cell injury. Microarray analysis identified 47 differentially expressed miRNAs, among them 26 were upregulated and 21 were downregulated. Moreover, integrating dysregulated miRNAs target prediction and altered mRNA expression enabled us to identify 1181 putative target genes for further bioinformatics analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the putative target genes were involved in apoptosis process and regulation of transcription. Pathway analysis indicated that the top upregulated pathways included MAPK and p53 signaling pathway, while the top downregulated pathways were PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling pathway. Further network analysis showed that MAPK signaling pathway and apoptosis with the highest degree were identified as core pathways, hsa-miR-9-3p and hsa-miR-371b-5p as the most critical miRNAs, and CASK, ASH1L, CDK6 etc. as hub target genes. In addition, the expression level change of selected five microRNAs (hsa-miR-4299, hsa-miR-297, hsa-miR-3135b, hsa-miR-9-3p, and hsa-miR-371b-5p) and two mRNAs(CASK and CDK6) were validated in cisplatin-induced HK-2 cells. Furthermore, a similar trend of expression level change was observed in NRK-52E cells by cisplatin treatment. Overall, our results provide the molecular basis and potential targets for the treatment of cisplatin-induced renal tubular cell injury. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This study focused on mortalin expression and its relevance to the prognosis in serous ovarian carcinoma, mortalin modulated cell malignant proliferation and EMT progression via Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. In this study, data obtained from Oncomine database, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) analysis and Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to assess the expression of mortalin in serous ovarian carcinoma. The prognostic value of mortalin was analyzed using Meier plotter database and Kaplan-Meier. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and colony formation assay were used to detect cell reproductive capacity. SK-OV-3 cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured by wound-healing, migration and western-blot assays. Data from Oncomine showed that mortalin was highly expressed in serous ovarian carcinomas compared with corresponding normal controls. Similar results were found in CCLE analysis and in clinical specimens. High mortalin expression was associated with high histological grade and worse overall survival (OS) rate. The results of MTT analyses, IF staining, and colony formation assay indicated that MKT-077 (1-Ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolylidene)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinylidene] methyl]-pyridinium chloride) suppressed the viability of SK-OV-3 cells. Besides, mortalin suppression restrained cell EMT progression by Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, mortalin is over-expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma. High mortalin expression could be a candidate for the prognostic indicator and a biomarker in serous ovarian carcinoma. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The atypical orphan receptors DAX1 and SHP constitute the NR0B subgroup of human nuclear receptor (hNR) family; they play key roles in metabolism, reproduction, nutrition and steroidogenesis, and are involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases such as cancer and adrenal hypoplasia. The two receptors lack the classical DNA-binding domain and act as the corepressors of other hNRs. The DAX1 and SHP contains three and two conserved LXXLL motifs, respectively, which can be recognized and bound by the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of hNR proteins in agonist conformation. Here, we attempt to explore the systematic interaction profile between the five DAX1/SHP LXXLL motifs and all the 48 hNR AF-2 domains found in the human genome, to analyze the binding affinity and specificity of these motifs towards the complete domain array, and to design LXXLL-based, hydrocarbon-stapled peptides that can target the specific interaction profile for each motif. A weighted source–target network from motifs to domains is created based on the modeled domain–motif complex structures and calculated binding potencies, from which the specific interaction profile of each motif against the whole hNR array is depicted and clustered to measure the binding similarity and relationship among these motifs. Dynamics simulations reveal that the LXXLL-based peptides are highly flexible in free unbound state, thus unfavorable to be recognized and bound by AF-2 domains. Hydrocarbon-stapling technique is employed to help the constraint of these unstructured peptides to active helical conformation, thus largely improving their binding affinity to the hNR array. The hydrocarbon bridge is designed to point out of the domain's active pocket, which would not disrupt the direct interaction between the domain and peptide. Energetic decomposition imparts that the stapling has only a very modest influence on the interaction enthalpy and desolvation effect of domain–peptide binding, but can substantially reduce entropy penalty upon the binding. For a peptide ligand, the entropic reduction can be roughly regarded as a constant, which only improves (absolute) peptide binding affinity towards the whole domain array, but does not alter (relative) peptide binding specificity over different domains in the array.

    "Abstract": "P2X4 receptor (P2X4R), a subtype of P2 purinergic receptors, is an ATP-gated receptor through which activity of spinal microglia instigates pain hypersensitivity in various pain conditions. Accumulating evidence indicates that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) plays an important role in chronic pain facilitation, and it could stimulate microglia activation and involve in regulating P2X4R expression. However, the mechanism of MCP-1 in regulating the expression of P2X4R in microglia is poorly understood, and whether MCP-1 can aggravate pain via up-regulating spinal P2X4R expression in Cancer-induced Bone Pain (CIBP) remains unclear. In this study, we observed that Iba-1 and P2X4R expression is increased in microglia treated with MCP-1, and blockade with a selective CCR2 antagonist RS-504393 suppressed microglia activation and reduced P2X4R expression in cultured microglia. In response to MCP-1, the expression level of p-Akt was also increased and RS-504393 inhibited the increase. Besides, PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 could attenuate MCP-1-induced P2X4R expression in cultured microglia. MCP-1 was found to be associated with P2X4R expression and mechanical allodynia induced by CIBP in vivo since the expression of MCP-1 was increased in CIBP and RS-504393 alleviated the P2X4R expression and mechanical allodynia in CIBP. Moreover, RS-504393 also reduced the increase of p-Akt induced by CIBP. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway may partly reduce MCP-1/CCR2-induced expression of P2X4R and mechanical allodynia in CIBP rats. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Radix Scutellariae (RS), the dried root of Scutellariae baicalensis Georgi, known as a herbal medicine in several Asian countries including China, has been widely used to treat inflammation, hypertension, cardiovascular disease as well as cancer. The total flavonoid aglycone extracted (TFAE) was extracted by ethyl acetate and this extraction methodology was optimized and obtained the protection of Chinese patents. Aim of the study: To investigate the underlying mechanism of the chemotherapeutic effects of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods: We performed CCK8 assays, AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining, flow cytometry assays, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot to study the molecular mechanism of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Results: In vitro, TFAE exhibits significant anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer cell lines, especially for BxPC3 (IC 50 = 6.5 μg mL −1 ). Moreover, TFAE induces apoptosis and autophagy as evidenced by the increased apoptosis or autophagy-related protein level, the increased the fraction of apoptotic cells and the punctuate patterns of LC3 II. Furthermore, TFAE induce autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, pharmacological block autophagy by 3-MA enhanced TFAE-induced apoptosis, indicating that TFAE induced autophagy functions as a cytoprotective process against apoptosis. In vivo, 150 mg/kg TFAE inhibited the BxPC3 tumor growth in immune deficient mice with the inhibitory rate of 66.87% and induced both apoptosis and autophagy. Conclusion: TFAE have anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer and can induce apoptosis and autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway. TFAE might be a potential anticancer drug to be further developed for human pancreatic cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Jianpi Yangzheng Xiaozheng Decoction (JPYZXZ) is an empirical compound prescription based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. JPYZXZ, which is “Qi-invigorating, spleen-strengthening and stasis-removing,” can improve the quality of life of gastric cancer patients and prolong their survival; however, the exact mechanism underlying the antitumor effects of this compound is still not clear. Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to clearly define the effect of JPYZXZ and its components, Jianpi Yangzheng Decoction (JPYZ) and Xiao Zheng San Jie Decoction (XZSJ), on inhibiting the progression of gastric cancer. Materials and methods: The effect of JPYZXZ and its components on the motility of gastric cancer MGC-803 cells was measured by MTT, adhesion, transwell assays and wound-healing assays. JPYZXZ, JPYZ and XZSJ were administered to 615 mice with gastric cancer xenografts, and their effect on the inhibition of subcutaneous transplantation was analyzed. THP-1 monocyte cells were used to establish tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) models. The polarized state of the TAMs was detected by Flow Cytometry, ELISA and Immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression of tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and TAM-related genes was determined by Real-time PCR and Western Blot, respectively. Results: We determined that both JPYZXZ and its components inhibited the progress of gastric cancer in vitro, and JPYZXZ was clearly more effective than JPYZ or XZSJ. The in vivo results demonstrated that the JPYZXZ and XZSJ group exhibited a significant decrease in the tumor weight compared to the control group. Further analysis indicated that JPYZXZ was more active than JPYZ or XZSJ in inhibiting the gastric cancer EMT transformation both in vivo and in vitro. However, JPYZ was more effective compared with JPYZXZ for inducing the phenotypic change in macrophages from M2 to M1. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that both JPYZXZ and its components prevent the progress of gastric cancer. JPYZXZ inhibits the gastric cancer EMT more effectively than JPYZ and XZSJ, but JPYZ primarily works to regulate the phenotypic change in macrophages from M2 to M1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: The extensive biodiversity of plants in Southeast Asia and inadequate research hitherto warrant a continued investigation into medicinal plants. On the basis of a careful review of fresh medicinal plant usage to treat cancer from previous ethnobotanical interviews in Singapore and from the traditional uses of the indigenous plants, fresh leaves of seven locally grown medicinal plant species were evaluated for anti-proliferative activity. Aim of the study: To evaluate the anti-proliferative activity of local medicinal plant species Clausena lansium Skeels, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau, Leea indica (Burm. f.) Merr., Pereskia bleo (Kunth) DC., Strobilanthes crispus (L.) Blume, Vernonia amygdalina Delile and Vitex trifolia L. Materials and method: Fresh, healthy and mature leaves of the seven medicinal plants were harvested from various locations in Singapore and Malaysia for Soxhlet, ultrasonication and maceration extractions in three different solvents (water, ethanol and methanol). Cell proliferation assay using water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay was performed on twelve human cancer cell lines derived from breast (MDA-MB-231, T47D), cervical (C33A), colon (HCT116), leukemia (U937), liver (HepG2, SNU-182, SNU-449), ovarian (OVCAR-5, PA-1, SK-OV-3) and uterine (MES-SA/DX5) cancer. Results: A total of 37 fresh leaf extracts from seven medicinal plants were evaluated for their anti-tumour activities in twelve human cancer cell lines. Of these, the extracts of C. lansium, L. indica, P. bleo, S. crispus, V. amygdalina and V. trifolia exhibited promising anti-proliferative activity against multiple cancer cell lines. Further investigation of selected promising leaf extracts indicated that maceration methanolic extract of L. indica was most effective overall against majority of the cancer cell lines, with best IC 50 values of 31.5 ± 11.4 µg/mL, 37.5 ± 0.7 µg/mL and 43.0 ± 6.2 µg/mL in cervical C33A, liver SNU-449, and ovarian PA-1 cancer cell lines, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study provide new scientific evidence for the traditional use of local medicinal plant species C. lansium, L. indica, P. bleo, S. crispus, V. amygdalina and V. trifolia in cancer treatment. These results highlight the importance of the upkeep of these indigenous plants in modern society and their relevance as resources for drug discovery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Studies have shown that the etiology and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer are closely related to the tumor microenvironment, and the cancer tissue is still in the state of “energy deficit” and has to promote energy generation through high glycolysis. Rhus chinensis Mill is a Chinese herbal medicine used to treat various types of solid tumors in China. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease group caused by abnormal changes in glucose metabolism resulted in lactic acid production, which remodels acidosis. Aim of the study: Although previous studies have shown that the active compounds of Rhus chinensis Mill. can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, whether its triterpenoids could effectively regulate glycolysis involved in CRC have not been systematically investigated. Materials and methods: In this study, the extraction of triterpenoids extract from Rhus chinensis Mill. was obtained, and cell viability assay, the percentage of apoptosis for CRC cells were counted, and matrigel invasion assay and production of lactic acid and glucose uptake assay was determined. we further examined the expression of the key glycolytic enzymes and acid-sending ion channel (ASIC) family members of SW620 cells, and some key proteins in the glycolytic pathway were further verified. Results: Notably, triterpenoids (TER) of Rhus chinensis Mill. showed effective anti-proliferative activity and significantly altered protein levels associated with CRC cell survival and glycolysis metabolism. TER could down-regulate the expression of ASIC2, in CRC SW620 cell line. Most importantly, the levels of ASIC2 and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were also down-regulated by TER. Furthermore, inhibition of activated the ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT1 pathway and target gene transcript expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in parallel to reduce, and resulted in the reduced invasion ability by TER treatment. Conclusion: The potential pathways and targets that involved in glycolysis to excert the anti-CRC effects of main compounds in triterpenoids of Rhus chinensis Mill. were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Our findings thus provided rational evidence that inhibition of the ASIC2-induced calcineurin/NFAT pathway by triterpenoids in Rhus chinensis Mill. profoundly suppressed cell growth and invasion in CRC, which target alternative glycolysis in colorectal tumor cells, may be a useful adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic pollutants for which some are known carcinogens, there is limited information on the cancer risk such substances pose to the population via marine sediments, despite a significant part of the world's food supply being derived from the coastal environment. This study was conducted in a heavily industrialized and urbanized coastal area, in Trinidad. PAHs were quantified in sediments during the dry and wet seasons and were observed to be significantly higher in the wet season compared to the dry season. Also emerging from this study is that PAH levels were lower, in the areas where natural gas is the dominant energy source for industries, compared with those areas where crude oil-based fossil fuel is predominantly used. Perylene levels were demonstrated to be of biogenic origin near the protected wetland area. It was observed that nearshore sediment PAHs concentrations were higher than offshore levels. The sources of PAHs, identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) in the marine sediments, were vehicular combustion of gasoline and diesel, biomass burning, industrial combustion and oil spills. The mean Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risks (ILCR) due to fish consumption from this region during the dry and wet seasons was &gt;1 × 10 −4 , indicating a high cancer risk to the human population. The annual non-cancer risk (HQ) was high &gt;1 at the 90th percentile level with an adverse risk to about 14% of the population. These results can be utilized for developing an effective environmental management policy for coastal areas in Trinidad and the wider Caribbean region, given that much of the islands’ populations depend on the coastal regions for seafood. In addition, these results may assist in boosting current efforts of policymakers, towards phasing out crude oil-based fossil fuels for cleaner energy sources, such as compressed natural gas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Amorphophalli Rhizoma has been widely used as an adjuvant treatment for advanced or metastatic breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatoma, and malignant lymphoma, but its molecular mechanism of action for treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally poorly understood. Aim of the study: To investigate genomic changes related to the inhibitory effect of Amorphophalli Rhizoma and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this inhibition in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Materials and methods: Gene chip analysis was employed to explore genomic changes caused by Amorphophalli Rhizoma in TNBC cells. Potential classical signaling pathways, upstream regulators, functions, regulatory effects and gene interaction networks were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA interference (RNAi) assays were used to clarify the roles of potential target genes. Results: In total, 536 significantly upregulated and 648 significantly downregulated genes were identified between the group treated with Amorphophalli Rhizoma extract and that treated with vehicle. Many of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in TNBC cells are involved in DNA replication, recombination and repair, the cell cycle, and cellular assembly and organization. Attenuation of KNL1, OLFML2A, RTKN2 and SGO1 gene expression by Amorphophalli Rhizoma significantly induced cell cycle arrest and suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Conclusions: The inhibitory effects of Amorphophalli Rhizoma in TNBC cells likely occur through regulation of the spindle checkpoint, chromosomal and centrosomal instability, and cell membrane stability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Aim of the study: This work was designed to determine the cytotoxicity of the crude extract (FTB), fractions (FTBa-d) and compounds isolated from the bark of Fagara tessmannii, namely lupeol (1), fagaramide (2), zanthoxyline (3), hesperidin (4), nitidine chloride (5), fagaridine chloride (6), and β-sitosterol-3-O-β- D -glucopyranoside (7). The study was extended to the mode of induction of apoptosis by FTB, compounds 5 and 6. Materials and methods: The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of samples. The cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry. Column chromatography was used for the purification of FTB. Meanwhile, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis was applied for structural elucidation. Results: The crude extract, fractions FTBa, FTBc, FTBd as well as compounds 5 and 6 revealed cytotoxicity towards the 9 tested cancer cell lines. The IC 50 values ranged from 17.34 µg/mL (towards U87MG.ΔEGFR glioblastoma cells) to 40.68 µg/mL (against CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) for FTB, from 16.78 µg/mL (towards U87. MGΔEGFR cells) to 37.42 µg/mL (against CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells) for FTBa, from 19.47 µg/mL (towards U87. MG glioblastoma cells) to 41.62 µg/mL (against CCRF-CEM cells) for FTBc, from 14.17 µg/mL (against HCT116p53 -/- colon adenocarcinoma cells) to 22.28 µg/mL (towards CEM-ADR5000 cells) for FTBd, from 1.75 µM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 23.52 µM (against U87. MGΔEGFR cells) for compound 5, from 1.69 µM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 22.06 µM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for compound 6 and from 0.02 µM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96 µM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. FTB induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by enhanced ROS production. Compound 5 induced apoptosis through caspases activation and increase ROS production. Meanwhile, 6 induced apoptosis mediated by caspases activation, MMP alteration and enhanced ROS production. Conclusion: Fagara tessmannii as well as its constituents 5 and 6 revealed considerable cytotoxicity and may be suitable candidates deserving to be further explored to develop new anticancer drugs to combat sensitive and resistant phenotypes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
