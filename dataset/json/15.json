    "Abstract": "Monomeric zinc phthalocyanine has been studied as a promising active photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy against cancer, in which its aggregate form is non-active. This paper aimed to describe the monomer/aggregates equilibrium of zinc phthalocyanine in binary water/DMSO mixtures. To reach this aim theoretical calculation, electronic absorption, static and time-resolved fluorescence, and resonance light scattering was used. Zinc phthalocyanine shows a complex water dependence behavior in the mixture. At least three distinct steps were observed: (i) until 30% water zinc phthalocyanine is essentially in the monomeric form, changing to (ii) small slipped cofacial-aggregates around 30% to 40% water and finally to (iii) a staircase arrangement of large aggregates at higher water percent. The staircase arrangement is driven by the intermolecular coordination between the pyrrolic nitrogen lone-pairs and the central metal zinc. The water-Zn coordination governs the fluorescence quenching by a static mechanism. These results have direct relevance in the better understanding on the behavior of zinc phthalocyanine in vivo and when incorporated in drug delivery systems for clinical applications in photodynamic therapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a novel asymmetric cinnamic acid zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc, 1) containing three tert-butyl substituents is reported. The asymmetric ZnPc (1) is further linked to amino functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (AMNPs) (1-AMNPs) and to cysteine functionalized silver nanoparticles (cys-AgNPs) (1-cys-AgNPs) through an amide bond. 1-AMNPs and 1-cys-AgNPs improved the triplet and singlet oxygen quantum yields of complex 1, this was also observed with the previously reported 2-AMNPs when compared to 2 while 3-AMNPs yielded an unexpected decrease in triplet quantum yield as compared to 3. The silver nanoparticles (1-cys-AgNPs) had a better effect on improving the singlet oxygen quantum yield of complex 1 than the magnetic nanoparticles (1-AMNPs). The Pcs and conjugates recorded low cell cytotoxicity in the dark and high photocytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells in-vitro. MCF-7 cell viabilities of less than 50% were recorded at 80 μg/mL making the Pcs and conjugates under study potential candidates for use as photosensitizers in cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A novel light-responsive nanovalve is facilely prepared on mesoporous silica (mSiO2) coated upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) through modification of photo-cleavagable pyrenemethyl ester (Py) molecules on its surface. These Py molecules can associate with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) molecules as gatekeepers to block the mSiO 2 pore channels and entrap the loaded drugs. Upon NIR light irradiation, NIR light is upconverted to ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) light by UCNP, and the modified Py molecules are cleaved by the upconverted UV light leading to the detachment of β-CD gatekeepers to trigger drug release. For the fabrication of a monitoring system, β-CD is covalently conjugated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as drug release indicator (FITC-β-CD). The luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) from UCNP to Py/FITC-β-CD before drug release results in the quenching of Vis emission of UCNP while the detachment of Py/FITC-β-CD nanovalves after drug release diminishes the LRET between UCNP and FITC-β-CD which recovers the luminescence of UCNP, the change in luminescence provides a potential capability for one to quantitatively monitor the drug release process. in vitro study shows a remarkable killing ability on HeLa cancer cell of this system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Tripartite motif 66 (TRIM66) protein, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein superfamily, has emerged as an oncogenic protein that is closely related to carcinogenesis in multiple cancers. However, whether TRIM66 plays a role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. This study was aimed to investigate TRIM66 expression and its potential biological function in HCC cell lines. Here we showed that TRIM66 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC cell lines compared with normal control cells. Loss-of-function experiments by RNA interfering knockdown of TRIM66 showed that TRIM66 inhibition significantly reduced the proliferation, colony formation, and invasion of HCC cells, whereas gain-of-function by overexpression of TRIM66 exhibited the opposite effect. Further investigation showed that TRIM66 was involved in regulating glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation and β-catenin expression. Knockdown of TRIM66 impeded the activation of Wnt signaling, while overexpression of TRIM66 promoted Wnt signaling activation. Moreover, inhibition of GSK-3β by specific inhibitor partially reversed TRIM66 inhibition-mediated antitumor effect, while knockdown of β-catenin blocked the oncogenic effect of TRIM66 overexpression in HCC cells. Additionally, in vivo experiments using a xenograft tumor model showed that TRIM66 knockdown blunted the tumorigenicity of HCC cells associated with downregulation of β-catenin expression. Overall, our results showed that TRIM66 functioned as an oncogenic protein in HCC by promoting the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our study suggests that TRIM66 is a potential target for HCC treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We report the biological activity of the new Schiff base ligand H 2 L (H 2 L = 6,6'-((1E,11E)-5,8-dioxa-2,11-diazadodeca-1,11-diene-1,12-diyl)bis(2,4-dichlorophenol)), its derived metal(II) complexes [Cu(L)] (1), [Co(L)] (2), [Ni(L)] (3) and [Zn(L)] (4), alongwith their structural characterizations by using various analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Single crystal XRD studies suggested that the prepared metal(II) complexes adopted a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The 1 H NMR and FTIR data concluded that the Schiff base ligand H 2 L acts as a tetra-dentate ligand coordinating with metal(II) ions through the oxygen atom of the phenolic group and nitrogen atom of the azomethine group. Complexes 1 and 4 were found to be efficient in bringing about antimicrobial activities. The proposed mechanism of their antimicrobial activities has been discussed. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed the remarkable cytotoxicity of complex 1 (IC 50 = 19 ± 1.1 μg/mL) on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells than Schiff base ligand H 2 L and complexes 2–4. Moreover, AO/EB staining assay revealed cell death due to apoptosis in MCF-7 cells and the generation of ROS by the Schiff base ligand H 2 L and its derived metal(II) complexes 1–4 may be a possible cause for their cytotoxic activity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "β-lactoglobulin (BLG) is a well characterized milk protein and a model for folding and aggregation studies. Rutin is a quercetin based-flavanoid and a famous dietary supplement. It is a potential protector from coronary heart disease, cancers, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, amyloid fibrillation is reported in BLG at pH 2.0 and temperature 358 K. It is inhibited to some extent by rutin with a rate of 99.3 h −1 M −1 . Amyloid fibrillation started taking place after 10 h of incubation and completed near 40 h at a rate of 16.6 × 10 −3 h −1 , with a plateau during 40–108 h. Disruption of tertiary structure of BLG and increased solvent accessibility of hydrophobic core seem to trigger intermolecular assembly. Increase in 7% β-sheet structure at the cost of 10% α-helical structures and the electron micrograph of BLG fibrils at 108 h further support the formation of amyloid. Although it could not block amyloidosis completely, and even the time required to reach plateau remains the same, a decrease of growth rate from 16.6 × 10 −3 to 13.5 × 10 −3 h −1 was observed in the presence of 30.0 μM rutin. Rutin seems to block solvent accessibility of the hydrophobic core of BLG. A decrease in the fibril population was observed in electron micrographs, with the increase in rutin concentration. All evidences indicate reversal of fibrillation in BLG in the presence of rutin. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Nanosize metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of promising porous nanomaterials for biomedical applications, in which their size control and surface modification are critical. Current approaches for fabrication of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) nanoparticles (NPs) with controlled size and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) surface modification are separated and time-consuming. Here, we report a simple and rapid synthetic method that combines the size control of ZIF-8 NPs and their surface modification of PEG at the same time. Monovalent amino PEG (PEG-NH 2 ) was used as capping agent to control the size of ZIF-8 and simultaneously realize surface modification through coordination interaction. The size of ZIF-8 was tuned in a board range. The coated NPs showed intact crystalline structure with improved colloidal stability. By further adding the anticancer drug doxorubincin (DOX) into the reaction mixture, ZIF-8 NPs with encapsulated DOX and PEG surface modification (DOX@ZIF-8/PEG) can be synthesized in one-pot. They showed pH-responsive drug release property and efficacy in killing of cancer cells. Our facile one-pot process can be used to design MOFs NPs as multifunctional delivery systems for a variety of cargos such as therapeutic and imaging agents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Three new NNO tridentate Schiff bases derived from 5-bromosalicylaldehyde with 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine, 2-amino-4-methoxy-6-methylpyrimidine and 2-amino-4-chloro-6-methylpyrimidine (HL 1 , HL 2 and HL 3 , respectively) and their complexes with Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) have been prepared. These complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, 1 H NMR, IR and electronic spectra, and with the aid of magnetic moment, molar conductivity and mass spectrometry. We further determined some of their size on the nanoscale. The results indicated that Schiff bases behaved as a tridentate NNO chelator that coordinates to the metal ions by azomethine nitrogen, pyrimidine nitrogen and phenolic oxygen, demonstrating 1 to 1 (metal to ligand) ratio. The measurements of conductivity revealed a nonelectrolytic nature of the complexes. Electronic absorption and viscosity were used to explore the ability of investigated complexes to bind to DNA, and the results indicated that binding occurred through intercalation. The antimicrobial activities of the considered complexes were evaluated against some types of fungi and bacteria. Metal complexes exhibited more antimicrobial activity as compared to their ligands. Interestingly, the CuL 3 showed the highest antimicrobial activity. The anticancer activity of the chelators and their metal complexes were investigated on hepatic cellular and human colon carcinoma cells (HepG-2 cell line) and (HCT-116 cell line), respectively. The metal complexes have shown promising results in preclinical testing and they have enhanced anti-proliferative activity against growth of cancer cells compared to their ligand. Moreover, the docking study of the HL 1 HL 2 HL 3 and their Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) was reported. The theoretical DFT calculations were applied to verify the molecular geometry of chelators and their complexes. The geometry optimization results are in agreement with experimental observations. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies benefit to patients and the conjugation to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) might bring additional activities to these macromolecules. However, the behavior of the conjugate will largely depend on the bulkiness of the AuNP and small sizes are moreover preferable for diffusion. Water-soluble thiolate-protected AuNPs having diameters of 2-3 nm can be synthesized with narrow polydispersity and can selectively react with incoming organic thiols via a SN2-like mechanism. We therefore synthesized a mixed thionitrobenzoic acid- , thioaminobenzoic acid-monolayered AuNP of 2.4 nm in diameter and developed a site-selective conjugation strategy to link the AuNP to Cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody used in clinic. The water-soluble 80 kDa AuNP was fully characterized and then reacted to the hinge area of Cetuximab, which was selectively reduced using mild concentration of TCEP. The conjugation proceeded smoothly and could be analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating the formation of a 1:1 AuNP-IgG conjugate as the main product. When added to EGFR expressing glioblastoma cells, the AuNP-Cetuximab conjugate selectively bound to the cell surface receptor, inhibited EGFR autophosphorylation and entered into endosomes like Cetuximab. Altogether, we describe a simple and robust protocol for a site-directed conjugation of a thiolate-protected AuNP to Cetuximab, which could be easily monitored, thereby allowing to assess the quality of the product formation. The conjugated 2.4 nm AuNP did not majorly affect the biological behavior of Cetuximab, but provided it with the electronic properties of the AuNP. This offers the ability to detect the tagged antibody and opens application for targeted cancer radiotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "Applying nanobubbles (NBs) for contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging has received increased attention. NBs are biocompatible, multifunctional, theranostic agents. Their properties of high echogenicity and stability create an agent suitable for ultrasonography diagnosis. Their favorable properties of size, in vivo stability, and ease of modification are being exploited to implement a theranostic platform for cancer treatment. The considerable development offers the potential to overcome drug resistance and adverse side effects that are associated with traditional chemotherapy. This review outlines the principles of ultrasonography and angiogenesis. Microbubbles and micelles are also discussed to underline the superior capabilities of NBs for the application. NBs could passively accumulate to tumor tissue by enhanced permeability and retention effect. In addition, it can also achieve the active transportation by surface modification. Active targeting modalities and stimuli-responsive drug delivery modifications generate a therapeutic vehicle. The cytotoxicity of NBs formulations, multimodal imaging capability, active targeting mechanisms, and drug delivery methods are highlighted to confirm the NB as a vehicle for targeted treatment and enhanced ultrasound imaging.",

    "Abstract": "Nanomaterials have specific properties which are uncommon in their bulk counterparts. Because of these unique characteristics, nanotechnology has been explored for various applications by the scientific community and it can play a crucial role in providing solutions of current major healthcare problems. In the present work, we describe the fabrication of a novel inorganic alternative of traditional antibiotics, which can effectively counter the pathogenic bacteria including multi drug resistant bacterial strains. For this purpose, nanocomposites of Fe/Ni oxide with different molar concentrations of nickel have been prepared via wet-chemical approach along with the α-Fe2O3 and NiO nanoparticles. The bactericidal efficiency of the prepared samples were tested against pathogenic strains of B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli and S. typhi using two distinct methods. In addition to this, structural, physical and chemical properties of the nanomaterials were studied using XRD, TEM, EDAX, Raman, VSM and TGA-DTA. Also, the cytotoxicity of synthesized samples was assessed using MTT assay against human cell lines MCF-10A (normal) and MCF7 (cancer).",

    "Abstract": "The internalization kinetics resulting from magnetic nanoparticle interactions with tumor cells play an important role in nanoparticle-based cancer treatment efficiency. Here, the uptake kinetics of magnetoliposomes (ML) into human pancreatic tumor cells (MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3) are quantified using magnetic particle spectrometry. A comparison to the uptake kinetics for healthy L929 cells is given. The experimental results are used for the development of an uptake kinetics model describing the three relevant internalization processes: ML adsorption to the cell membrane, endo- and exocytosis. By fitting of experimental data, the rate constant of each internalization process is determined enabling the prediction of internalized ML at any incubation time. After seven hours incubation time, MiaPaCa-2 internalized three times more ML than BxPC-3 and L929 cells even though their ML adsorption rate constants were nearly the same. As the interaction of the ML with the cell membrane is non-specific, the uptake kinetics mirror the individual cell response to ML internalization. With a new mathematical term to cover the exocytosis contribution to the overall internalization process, the extended uptake kinetics model offers new possibilities to analyze the specific internalization mechanism for other nanoparticle and cell types.",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers globally. A large portion of colorectal cancer patients who are treated with conventional chemotherapy eventually develop local recurrence or metastases. The failure of a complete cure in colorectal cancer patients may be related to the lack of complete eradication of cancer stem cells when using conventional therapy. Colorectal cancer stem cells comprise a small population of tumor cells that possess the properties of rapid proliferation and differentiation. The colorectal cancer stem cells are also phenotypically and molecularly distinct, and resistant to conventional chemo-radiotherapy. Therefore, it is important to identify approaches in combination with conventional therapy for targeting and eradicating cancer cells. The aim of this review was to summarize the main findings of recent studies on targeting colorectal cancer stem cells as a novel therapeutic approach in colorectal cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Breast metastases from gynecologic cancers are rare. Cervical cancer most commonly metastasizes to the lung, liver or bone. When cervical cancer metastasizes to the breast, the presentation is usually a solitary breast mass; rarely, however, breast metastases can mimic inflammatory breast cancer.

    "Abstract": "The objectives of this study were to determine both surgical and subsequent cancer outcomes for high-risk women from the University of Virginia's High-Risk Breast/Ovarian Cancer clinic undergoing ovarian cancer risk-reducing surgery. Retrospective review identified high risk women who had ovarian risk reducing surgery over the past decade and surgical outcomes, pathology, pre-operative screening results, and pre-/post-operative cancer diagnoses were evaluated. One hundred and eighty-three high-risk women had risk reducing surgery at a mean age of 50.1 years and with a mean BMI of 28.9 kg/m2 at the time of surgery. Most women (103; 56.3%) had a strong family history of cancer concerning for a hereditary syndrome without an identified mutation, 35.5% of women carried a known deleterious mutation and 7.7% of women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer. The most common procedure was a risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy (RRBSO, 89.1%). All women underwent the Sectioning and Extensively Examining the Fimbriated End (SEE-FIM) pathology protocol which found two (1.1%) invasive ovarian cancers (one ovarian/tubal carcinosarcoma, one granulosa cell ovarian cancer), three (1.6%) serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), and one (1.1%) invasive fallopian tube cancer. Subsequent cancer diagnoses included one (0.5%) primary peritoneal cancer, four (2.2%) DCIS, and seven (3.8%) invasive breast cancers. Ultimately, among all high-risk women undergoing RR surgery, about 3.3% were diagnosed with a STIC or an ovarian cancer none of which were identified on screening. All STIC and tubal cancers were diagnosed in women with BRCA mutations (6.6% rate for this group). © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Currently, Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, is an approved anti-cancer drug for the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. Considering low response rate and events of high toxicity caused by irinotecan, we evaluated a series of thirteen thiazolyl hydrazone derivatives of 1-indanone for their potential antineoplastic activity and four compounds showed promising anti-cancer activity against most of the tested colon cancer cell lines with IC 50 values ranging from 0.41 ± 0.19 to 6.85 ± 1.44 μM. It is noteworthy that the compound, N-Indan-1-ylidene-N’-(4-Biphenyl-4-yl-thiazol-2-yl)-hydrazine (ITH-6) is found to be more effective than irinotecan against colon cancer cells, HT-29, COLO 205, and KM 12. Mechanistic studies reveal that ITH-6 arrests these cancer cell lines in G2/M phase of the cell cycle, induces apoptosis and causes an increase in ROS level with a significant reduction in the GSH level. The mechanism of inhibition relates to the inhibition of tubulin polymerization in the mitotic phase. These findings suggest that ITH-6 is a novel drug candidate for the treatment of colorectal cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in cancer is increasing. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature to determine demographic profiles and prevalence and reasons for use in cancer patients. Methods: In this systematic review, the databases OVID, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for studies on CAM use in cancer between 2009 and June 2018. Results: The results showed that an average of 51% of cancer patients used CAM. Common independent demographic characteristics associated with CAM use were younger, female cancer patients, having higher education, earning a higher income and having previously used CAM. Frequent reasons for use, grouped into themes were shown to be to influence their cancer and general health and to treat complications of the cancer or therapy. Conclusion: The review provides an insight and will serve to better inform health professionals on how this population is using CAM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: In 2000, a panel of experts published a proposal for the selection of lymph node target volumes for definitive head and neck radiation therapy (Radiother Oncol, 2000; 56: 135–150). Hereunder, this selection is updated and extended to also cover primary sites not previously covered. Patients and methods: The lymphatic spread of head and neck cancers into neck lymph nodes was comprehensively reviewed based on radiological, surgical and pathological literature regarding both initial involvement and patterns of failure. Then a panel of worldwide head and neck radiotherapy experts agreed on a consensus for the selection of both high- and low-risk lymph node target volumes for the node negative and the node positive neck. Results: An updated selection of lymph node target volumes is reported for oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity and carcinoma of unknown primary as a function of the nodal staging (UICC 8th edition). Conclusions: The selection of lymph node target volumes for head and neck cancers treated with IMRT/VMAT or other highly conformal techniques (e.g. proton therapy) requires a rigorous approach. This updated proposal of selection should help clinicians for the selection of lymph nodes target volumes and contribute to increase consistency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Patients with ovarian cancer frequently develop acquired drug resistance after the long-term chemotherapy, leading to disease progression. Enhanced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells; however, the molecular mechanisms involved are largely undefined. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a key regulatory enzyme in glucose metabolism, has been recognized as a gatekeeper of the Warburg effect, a hallmark of cancer. In this study, the function of PDK1 in cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer in terms of growth and EMT was investigated. PDK1 was upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. PDK1 knockdown in resistant cells led to increased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced cell death and apoptosis. PDK1 downregulation also reversed the EMT and cell motility in cisplatin-resistant cells. In a mouse xenograft model, tumors derived from PDK1-silenced ovarian cancer cells exhibited decreased tumor growth and EMT compared with control after the cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, PDK1 overexpression led to increased phosphorylation of EGFR, and blocking EGFR kinase activity by erlotinib reversed cisplatin resistance induced by PDK1 overexpression. Furthermore, in patients with ovarian cancer, higher PDK1 and p-EGFR levels were associated with chemoresistance. These results supported that PDK1 contributes to chemoresistance of ovarian cancer by activating EGFR. Therefore, PDK1 may serve as a promising target to combat chemoresistance of ovarian cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Low-grade serous ovarian cancer represents a minority of ovarian cancers and has distinctive features from high grade epithelial ovarian cancer. While less aggressive, in advanced stage they can be poorly chemo-responsive and incur a treatment challenge. Next generation sequencing of tumors has allowed for the potential for targeted therapy in cancer treatment, which can allow for avoidance of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. We present a case of a 56 year old female with advanced recurrent low grade serous ovarian cancer found to have NRAS mutation who underwent targeted therapy with trametinib with immediate and sustained disease response. We review the response and toxicity experienced by the patient, as well as treatment for her toxicity. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: Multimodality therapy (MMT) is recommended for patients with resectable gastric cancer, but no single approach has been established as standard. Little is presently known about current national practice patterns and sequencing of MMT. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients with gastric cancer aged 18 to 80 y in the National Cancer Database (2006-2014) with ≥T2 and/or node-positive disease (i.e., stage Ib to III) treated with MMT. Clinical nodal staging accuracy was ascertained among those treated with upfront surgery by comparing clinical and pathologic nodal staging. Multivariable Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between overall risk of death and MMT approach (i.e., radiation used versus not and treatment sequence). Results: Among 5817 patients, 16.1% received perioperative MMT, 50.6% preoperative only, and 33.3% postoperative only. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of clinical nodal staging were 68.4%, 88.8%, 91.1%, and 62.7%, respectively. Current clinical nodal staging modalities understage 37.3% of clinically node-negative patients. Over time, radiation utilization decreased (74.3% in 2006 versus 53.9% in 2014; trend test, P < 0.001), perioperative MMT increased (8.9% versus 22.2%%; trend test, P < 0.001), and postoperative MMT decreased (43.1% versus 21.0%; trend test, P < 0.001). Neither type of MMT nor treatment sequence is associated with risk of death. Conclusions: One-third of patients with gastric cancer who are candidates to receive MMT are treated with upfront surgery. Given the high false negative rate of clinical nodal staging and high noncompletion rate of postoperative treatment, efforts should be directed at improving and optimizing preoperative therapy utilization. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Globally, 39% of the world's adult population is overweight or obese and 23% is insufficiently active. These percentages are even larger in high-income countries with 58% overweight/obese and 33% insufficiently active. Fourteen cancer types have been declared by the World Cancer Research Fund to be causally associated with being overweight or obese: oesophageal adenocarcinoma, stomach cardia, colon, rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, breast, endometrium, ovary, advanced/fatal prostate, kidney, thyroid and multiple myeloma. Colon, postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancers have also been judged causally associated with physical inactivity. We aimed to quantify the proportion of cancer cases that would be potentially avoidable in Australia if the prevalence of overweight/obesity and physical inactivity in the population could be reduced. We used the simulation modelling software PREVENT 3.01 to calculate the proportion of avoidable cancers over a 25-year period under different theoretical intervention scenarios that change the prevalence of overweight/obesity and physical inactivity in the population. Between 2013 and 2037, 10-13% of overweight/obesity-related cancers in men and 7-11% in women could be avoided if overweight and obesity were eliminated in the Australian population. If everyone in the population met the Australian physical activity guidelines for cancer prevention (i.e. engaged in at least 300 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week), an estimated 2-3% of physical inactivity-related cancers could be prevented in men (colon cancer) and 1-2% in women (colon, breast and endometrial cancers). This would translate to the prevention of up to 190,500 overweight/obesity-related cancers and 19,200 inactivity-related cancers over 25 years. © 2018 UICC.",

    "Abstract": "Ribosomal protein S15A (RPS15A) has emerged as a novel oncogene of various human cancers. However, whether RPS15A is involved in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential relevance of RPS15A in pancreatic cancer and elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanism. We found that RPS15A expression was significantly up-regulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines. RPS15A knockdown resulted in a decrease of cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phases of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In addition, RPS15A knockdown down-regulated β-catenin expression and blocked the activation of Wnt signaling. Notably, RPS15A was identified as a target gene of microRNA-519d-3p (miR-519d-3p), a tumor suppressive miRNA. Further data showed that miR-519d-3p negatively regulated RPS15A expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, miR-591d-3p expression was significantly decreased in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tissues and was inversely correlated with RPS15A expression. The overexpression of miR-519d-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in pancreatic cancer cells, mimicking the similar effect of RPS15A knockdown. However, restoration of RPS15A expression partially reversed the antitumor effect of miR-519d-3p. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RPS15A knockdown or RPS15A inhibition by miR-519d-3p suppresses the growth of pancreatic cancer cells associated with the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our study suggests that the miR-519d-3p/RPS15A/Wnt/β-catenin regulation axis plays an important role in the progression of pancreatic cancer and may serve as potential targets for treatment of pancreatic cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) takes part in the pathologic processes of many types of cancer; however, its expression and roles in the biological behavior of gastric cancer remain unknown. TargetScan suggested that miR-145-5p is the predicted effective and conserved microRNA (miRNA) that binds to KLF5 through its 3′-untranslated region (UTR). We investigated the expression of KLF5 and miR-145-5p messenger RNA (mRNA) in gastric cancer and then analyzed its role in the biological behavior of gastric cancer cells. Our results indicated that KLF5 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 39.7% of the gastric cancer cases and was increased compared with that of the corresponding noncancerous normal mucosa (0.01 < p < 0.05). The poorly differentiated subtype showed positive KLF5 expression, whereas the differentiated subtype showed negative KLF5 expression (p < 0.05). Dual-luciferase reporter assay suggested KLF5 3′-UTR was the direct target of miR-145-5p. Compared with the differentiated gastric cancer, miR-145-5p was downregulated in undifferentiated gastric cancer (p < 0.05). The downregulation of KLF5 expression and differentiation of MGC-803 and BGC-823 caused by siKLF5 or miR-145-5p mimic transfection. Our results indicated that miR-145-5p/KLF5 3′-UTR affected the differentiation of gastric cancer. miR-145-5p was able to promote gastric cancer differentiation by targeting KLF5 3′-UTR directly. Our data suggest a novel mechanism for cancer differentiation and a new facet to the role of miR-145-5p/KLF5 in gastric cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Emerging evidence highlights the key regulatory roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and progression of numerous malignancies. The lncRNA identified as differentiation antagonizing nonprotein coding RNA (DANCR) is a novel lncRNA widely involved in the development of multiple human cancers. However, the function of DANCR and its potential molecular mechanism in cervical cancer remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that DANCR was significantly elevated in cervical cancer tissues and cells, and was closely correlated with poor prognosis of cervical cancer patients. In addition, knockdown of DANCR inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells in vitro, indicating that DANCR functioned as an oncogene in cervical cancer. Moreover, we verified that DANCR could directly bind to miR-335-5p, isolating miR-335-5p from its target gene Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1). Functional analysis showed that DANCR regulated ROCK1 expression by competitively binding to miR-335-5p. Further cellular behavioral experiments revealed that miR-335-5p mimics and ROCK1 knockdown reversed the effects of upregulated DANCR on proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cervical cancer cells by rescue assays. In summary, this study demonstrated that DANCR promoted cervical cancer progression by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate ROCK1 expression via sponging miR-335-5p, suggesting a novel potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Lymph node (LN) metastasis is the leading cause of bladder cancer-related mortality. Splicing factors facilitate cancer progression by modulating oncogenic variants, but it is unclear whether and how splicing factors regulate bladder cancer LN metastasis. In this study, Polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) expression was found to relate to bladder cancer LN metastasis, and was positively correlated with LN metastasis status, tumor stage, histological grade, and poor patient prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that PTBP1 promoted bladder cancer cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in vitro, as well as LN metastasis and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that PTBP1 upregulated MEIS2-L variant to promote metastasis and increased expression of PKM2 variant to enhance proliferation by modulating alternative mRNA splicing. Moreover, overexpression of MEIS2-L or PKM2 could rescue the oncogenic abilities of bladder cancer cells and the expression of MMP9 or CCND1 respectively after PTBP1 knockdown. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that PTBP1 induces bladder cancer LN metastasis and proliferation through an alternative splicing mechanism. PTBP1 may serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for LN-metastatic bladder cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Increasing evidence showed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. To date, lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) has revealed an oncogenic role in various tumors. However, the role of SNHG12 in cervical cancer is still unclear. Therefore, we focused on the biological function and molecular mechanism of SNHG12 in the tumorigenesis of cervical cancer. In this study, the expression of miR-125b was observably downregulated in cervical cancer cells. Meanwhile, the expression of SNHG12 was obviously upregulated in cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa, Caski, C4-1, and C33A) compared with the immortalized cervical epithelial cells. The further assay showed that miR-125b was a target of SNHG12 in cervical cancer. Moreover, a negative relationship between miR-125b and SNHG12 was found in cervical cancer. In addition, SNHG12 inhibition restrained the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Meanwhile, miR-125b mimics repressed the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The further assay showed that STAT3 was a target of miR-125b in cervical cancer. In addition, sh-STAT3 repressed the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, it showed that miR-125b inhibitors reversed STAT3 expression restrained by the reduction of SNHG12 expression. In general, SNHG12 modulated STAT3 by sponging miR-125b in cervical cancer and played an important role in the development of cervical cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The current case-control study comprehensively evaluated the status, quantity, and duration of smoking and alcohol drinking for both men and women, considering the subsites of colorectal cancer. A total of 925 colorectal cancer cases and 2775 controls were included in the analysis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed by logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders. In men, the risk of colorectal cancer significantly increased for heavy smokers who smoked ≥40 pack-years (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.22–2.50), ≥40 years (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.05–2.16), or ≥40 cigarettes/day (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.04–3.54). Men showed a significant increase in risk, especially for rectal cancer with an increasing amount or duration of smoking. In women, distal colon cancer risk increased in smokers who smoked ≥20 years (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.27–8.14) or ≥20 cigarettes/day (OR 4.75, 95% CI 1.09–20.57). Additionally, female smokers who smoked ≥20 cigarettes/day had an increased risk of rectal cancer (OR 6.46, 95% CI 1.64–25.46). Regarding the association of cigarettes smoked per day and the risk of rectal cancer, there was no significant difference between men and women (gender interaction p value = 0.14). Compared with never-drinkers, those who consumed alcohol at ≥40 g/day in men and ≥20 g/day in women had an OR of 2.39 (95% CI 1.68–3.41) and 3.52 (95% CI 1.56–7.96), respectively. The effect of daily alcohol consumption (g of ethanol/day) on cancer risk was not significantly different among subsites. Association of alcohol consumption quantity (g of ethanol/day) and the risk of proximal and distal colon cancer were stronger in women than in men (gender interaction p value < 0.01). There was no significant interaction in the multiplicative level when alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking were combined. The duration and amount of smoking as well as the amount of alcohol consumption were associated with an elevated risk of colorectal cancer in both men and women. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To evaluate the adjuvant therapy of trastuzumab cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in lifetime horizon and describe the use of an economic evaluation in supporting policy-making decisions in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer in Thailand. Methods: A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab for patients with early-stage breast cancer who were considered human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu-positive with a societal perspective and lifetime horizon. The research variables were probability of health state change, health utility, and cost of treatment. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using probabilistic methods. A budget impact analysis was also performed. Results: The results revealed that the treatment cost and QALYs in the trastuzumab group yielded 4.59 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $3387 (THB 118 572; THB = Thai baht) per QALY. On the basis of the willingness-to-pay threshold in Thailand, a 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab treatment for breast cancer was a cost-effective therapy. Conclusions: A combination therapy that includes trastuzumab is a preferable choice and should be used in early-stage breast cancer treatment. The Thai government has listed trastuzumab on the National List of Essential Medicines to be used for the early stages of breast cancer since 2014. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "The transcription factor forkhead box O 3A (FOXO3A) is a tumor suppressor that promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Piperlongumine (PL), a plant alkaloid, is known to selectively kill tumor cells while sparing normal cells. However, the mechanism of PL-induced cancer cell death is not fully understood. We report here that an association of FOXO3A with the pro-apoptotic protein BIM (also known as BCL2-like 11, BCL2L11) has a direct and specific function in PL-induced cancer cell death. Using HeLa cells stably expressing a FOXO3A-GFP fusion protein and several other cancer cell lines, we found that PL treatment induces FOXO3A dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation and promotes its binding to the BIM gene promoter, resulting in the up-regulation of BIM in the cancer cell lines. Accordingly, PL inhibited cell viability and caused intrinsic apoptosis in a FOXO3A-dependent manner. Of note, siRNA-mediated FOXO3A knockdown rescued the cells from PL-induced cell death. In vivo, the PL treatment markedly inhibited xenograft tumor growth, and this inhibition was accompanied by the activation of the FOXO3A-BIM axis. Moreover, PL promoted FOXO3A dephosphorylation by inhibiting phosphorylation and activation of Akt, a kinase that phosphorylates FOXO3A. In summary, our findings indicate that PL activates the FOXO3A-BIM apoptotic axis by promoting dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FOXO3A via Akt signaling inhibition. These findings uncover a critical mechanism underlying the effects of PL on cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional cytotoxic drugs preferentially eliminate differentiated cancer cells but spare relatively more resistant stem-like cancer cells capable to initiate recurrence. Due to cancer cell plasticity, the stem-like phenotype can be also acquired by cancer cells refractory to treatment with cytotoxic drugs. We investigated whether drugs inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinases could be used to target human colon cancer cells initiating cancer regrowth following conventional cytotoxic treatment. The moderately differentiated cell line HT-29 and poorly differentiated cell line HCT-116 were exposed to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cells that resisted the exposure to 5-FU were subsequently treated with imatinib or sunitinib. Both drugs reduced clonogenicity of 5-FU-refractory cells under normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. The expression of numerous stemness-related genes was upregulated in cancer cells following the exposure to 5-FU, and remained at a high level in 5-FU-refractory cells undergoing renewal under normoxia, but decreased spontaneously under hypoxia. Imatinib downregulated the expression of stemness-related genes in cells undergoing renewal under normoxia. A combination of imatinib with PRI-2191, an analogue of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 , downregulated stemness-related genes in HCT-116/5-FU cells more efficiently than imatinib alone. A synthetic analogue of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 2 (PRI-1906) abolished the effect of imatinib on gene expression in HCT-116/5-FU cells undergoing renewal under normoxia. Sunitinib promoted shift of phenotype of HT-29/5-FU cells undergoing renewal toward stem-like one. It suggests that the phenotype shift toward stemness induced by sequential sunitinib treatment following 5-FU treatment could increase a risk of cancer recurrence. In contrast to sunitinib, imatinib could be used both to interfere with cancer regrowth after conventional chemotherapy and to downregulate the expression of stemness-related genes in residual colon cancer cells capable to initiate cancer recurrence. The findings suggest that imatinib could also be combined with vitamin D analogue PRI-2191 to prevent recurrence more efficiently than imatinib alone and to compensate for vitamin D deficiency resulting from imatinib treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Epigenetic regulation contributes to lung cancer pathogenesis. The ADAMTS18 tumor suppressor gene is inactivated in some cancers, but its involvement in lung cancer has not been shown. Immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and methylation-specific PCR were used to assay ADAMTS18 expression and promoter methylation in lung tumor tissues and adjacent tissues. Cell viability, transwell, and wound-healing assays, as well as flow cytometry were used to characterize the biological activity of ADAMTS18. The influence of ADAMTS18 on protein expression was assayed using western blots analysis, and its effect on chemosensitivity was assayed by the response to cisplatin. We found that ADAMTS18 was silenced in lung cancer cells by promoter methylation. Demethylation by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, with or without the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, restored ADAMTS18 expression. Compared with normal lung tissue, ADAMTS18 in lung tumors was frequently methylated. Overexpression of ADAMTS18 in lung cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, ADAMTS18 suppressed epidermal growth factor receptor/protein kinase B (EGFR/AKT) signaling, which sensitized lung cancer cells to cisplatin. Thus, our results demonstrated that the tumor suppressor gene ADAMTS18 was downregulated in lung cancer by promoter CpG methylation, and it promoted sensitivity to cisplatin via EGFR/AKT signaling. Our study suggests that ADAMTS18 promoter methylation is a potential epigenetic biomarker for early detection of lung cancer and warrants investigation as a therapeutic target for early-stage lung cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "We created a two-channel autofluorescence test to detect oral cancer. The wavelengths 375 and 460 nm, with filters of 479 and 525 nm, were designed to excite and detect reduced-form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) autofluorescence. Patients with oral cancer or with precancerous lesions, and a control group with healthy oral mucosae, were enrolled. The lesion in the autofluorescent image was the region of interest. The average intensity and heterogeneity of the NADH and FAD were calculated. The redox ratio [(NADH)/(NADH + FAD)] was also computed. A quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) was used to compute boundaries based on sensitivity and specificity. We analyzed 49 oral cancer lesions, 34 precancerous lesions, and 77 healthy oral mucosae. A boundary (sensitivity: 0.974 and specificity: 0.898) between the oral cancer lesions and healthy oral mucosae was validated. Oral cancer and precancerous lesions were also differentiated from healthy oral mucosae (sensitivity: 0.919 and specificity: 0.755). The two-channel autofluorescence detection device and analyses of the intensity and heterogeneity of NADH, and of FAD, and the redox ratio combined with a QDA classifier can differentiate oral cancer and precancerous lesions from healthy oral mucosae. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the association between biomarkers of inflammation and metabolic dysregulation and cancer mortality by obesity status. Methods: Data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort was used to examine the associations between baseline biomarkers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and CRP) and metabolism (adiponectin, resisting and lipoprotein (a)) with cancer mortality among 1822 participants cancer-free at baseline. Weighted Cox proportional hazard regression with the robust sandwich method was used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for baseline covariates and stratified by BMI (normal, overweight/obese) given the significant interaction between biomarkers and BMI (p < 0.1). Results: During a mean follow-up of 8 years, there were statistically significant associations between cancer mortality and being in the highest vs. lowest tertile of IL-6 (HR: 5.3; 95% CI: 1.6, 17.8), CRP (HR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.0, 11.2) and resistin (HR: 3.7; 95% CI: 1.2, 11.2) among participants with normal BMI. IL-6 was also associated with a 3-fold (HR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 8.1) increased risk of cancer mortality among participants with overweight/obesity; however, neither CRP nor resistin was significantly associated with cancer mortality in this group. Conclusions: Higher baseline inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers were associated with significantly increased risk of cancer mortality after adjusting for baseline risk factors and the associations varied by BMI. Cancer patients may benefit from interventions that modulate inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The multivariate challenges associated with successful ovarian cancer therapy severely compromises the outcome of therapy and patient quality of life. Coated cholesterol (CHO) and distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) nano-lipobubbles (NLBs) loaded with silibinin and camptothecin were synthesized and evaluated as a possible intravenous delivery system for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Cytotoxicity analysis in addition to in vitro release, zeta potential and drug entrapment studies were conducted on the NLBs. Results of the cytotoxicity evaluation on A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells corroborated the benefits of the altered drug release characteristics achieved following polymeric coating. Cumulative cytotoxicity demonstrated by the NLBs 72 h post-treatment ranged between 85%–95%. Cellular internalization of the NLBs was swiftly achieved, with the extent of internalization exhibiting time-dependent characteristics. A size-dependent cellular internalization correlation between the NLB systems was also achieved. Evaluation of the prepared NLBs displayed favorable characteristics for the achievement of passive targeting and satisfactory drug incorporation for application in ovarian cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation results in multitude of cellular responses including generation of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage and is responsible for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Although genetic mutation is well documented, the epi-mutation, the alteration in epigenetics, remains elusive. In this study, we utilized CpG Methyl-seq to identify a genome-wide DNA CpG methylation, to profile the DNA methylation in UVB-irradiated SKH-1 mouse skin epidermis and non-melanoma skin papillomas at various stages. Methyl-seq and RNA-seq were performed to examine the methylation and corresponding transcriptome alterations. The methylation profiles in mouse epidermis were altered by UVB-irradiation as time progresses. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) identified many cancer related pathways including PTEN, p53, Nrf2 and inflammatory signaling in UVB-irradiation induced carcinogenesis. Additionally, some novel genes involved in skin carcinogenesis that were not previously reported were differentially methylated, including Enf2, Mgst2, Vegfa, and Cdk4. Taken together, the current study provides novel profiles and insights of methylation and transcriptomic changes at different stages of carcinogenesis in UVB-irradiation induced NMSC and offers potential targets for prevention and treatment of NMSC at different stages of human skin cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The embryonic stem cell-specific transcription factor, ZFP57, has been shown to play an important role in tumor formation. In this study, we examined if ZFP57 is involved in colorectal cancer metastasis. Materials and methods: First, we used colorectal cancer cell lines to perform in vivo metastatic experiments with nude mice. Next, we carried out immunohistochemical analysis of clinical specimens of colorectal cancers. Results: In liver metastatic experiments using human colorectal cancer HT29 and HCT116 cells, liver polymetastases occurred at high frequency in ZFP57-overexpressing HT29 and HCT116 cells, whereas both control cells only resulted in oligometastases. Next, we analyzed ZFP57 expression using clinical specimens. Liver metastasis-positive cases were more frequently associated with ZFP57 overexpression than negative cases in primary lesions of colorectal cancer, and the overexpression was particularly remarkable in tumor invasive lesions. Furthermore, ZFP57 overexpression was significantly correlated not only with liver metastasis but also with lymph node metastasis. In addition, the expression level of ZFP57 was significantly correlated with that of the metastasis-related gene NANOG. We also found that ZFP57 overexpression reduced the progression-free survival rate of patients with colorectal cancer. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that ZFP57 plays an important role in the hematogenous metastasis of colorectal cancer, suggesting that it could be used as a novel treatment target. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer type diagnosed in women worldwide. While breast cancer can occur in both men and women, it is by far more prevalent in women. Researchers have developed computer-aided systems for efficient diagnosis of breast cancer from histopathological microscopic images. These systems have contributed to increased diagnosis efficiency of biopsy tissue using hematoxylin and eosin stained images. However, most computer-aided diagnosis systems have traditionally used handcrafted feature extraction methods that are both ineffective and time-consuming. In this study, we propose an approach that utilizes deep learning models with convolutional layers to extract the most useful visual features for breast cancer classification. It is shown that these deep learning models can extract better features than handcrafted feature extraction approaches. We also propose a novel boosting strategy to achieve the main goal, whereby the system is efficiently enriched by progressively combining deep learning models (weak classifiers) into a stronger classifier. Our system is used to classify hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy images into two major groups (carcinomas and non-carcinomas) and four classes (normal tissues, benign lesions, in situ carcinomas and invasive carcinomas). We demonstrate applications to breast cancer histopathology images that have been considered challenging to diagnose based on conventional methodologies. Our results demonstrate that our breast cancer classifier with a boosting deep learning model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Accurate and early detection of breast cancer can ensure long-term surviving for the patients. However, traditional classification algorithms usually aim only to maximize the classification accuracy, failing to take into consideration the misclassification costs between different categories. Furthermore, the costs associated with missing a cancer case (false negative) are clearly much higher than those of mislabeling a benign one (false positive). To overcome this drawback and further improving the classification accuracy of the breast cancer diagnosis, in this work, a novel breast cancer intelligent diagnosis approach has been proposed, which employed information gain directed simulated annealing genetic algorithm wrapper (IGSAGAW) for feature selection, in this process, we performs the ranking of features according to IG algorithm, and extracting the top m optimal feature utilized the cost sensitive support vector machine (CSSVM) learning algorithm. Our proposed feature selection approach which can not only help to reduce the complexity of SAGASW algorithm and effectively extracting the optimal feature subset to a certain extent, but it can also obtain the maximum classification accuracy and minimum misclassification cost. The efficacy of our proposed approach is tested on Wisconsin Original Breast Cancer (WBC) and Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) breast cancer data sets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms other comparison methods. The main objective of this study was to apply our research in real clinical diagnostic system and thereby assist clinical physicians in making correct and effective decisions in the future. Moreover our proposed method could also be applied to other illness diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Increased drug resistance and acute side effects on normal organs are the major disadvantages of traditional cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This has increased the focus on targeted therapeutic strategies such as monoclonal antibody-based cancer therapies. The major advantage of antibody-based therapies is the specific inhibition of cancer-related targets, with reduced off-target side effects. Anterior gradient-2 (AGR2) is a prometastatic and proangiogenic tumor marker that is overexpressed in multiple cancers. Therefore, anti-AGR2 antibodies may be potential therapeutic agents for treating different cancers. In the present study, we examined a novel anti-AGR2 monoclonal antibody mAb18A4 and found that this antibody inhibited lung cancer progression and metastasis without exerting any adverse side effects on the major organs and blood in mice. Moreover, we found that mAb18A4 activated p53 pathway and attenuated ERK1/2–MAPK pathway. Furthermore, mAb18A4-treated cancer cell lines showed attenuated proliferation and colony formation, enhanced apoptosis, increased p53 expression, and reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression. Treatment with mAb18A4 significantly reduced tumor size and suppressed tumor metastasis in and increased the survival of different xenograft tumor models. In addition, mAb18A4 potently suppressed AGR2-induced angiogenesis. Results of pharmacokinetic and toxicological analyses confirmed the safety of mAb18A4 as an antitumor treatment. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies suggest a diet low in dietary magnesium intake or lower blood magnesium levels is linked with increased prostate cancer risk. This study investigates the race-specific link between blood magnesium and calcium levels, or dietary magnesium intake, and the diagnosis of low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer. The study included 637 prostate cancer cases and 715 biopsy-negative controls (50% black) recruited from Nashville, TN or Durham, NC. Blood was collected at the time of recruitment, and dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Percent genetic African ancestry was determined as a compliment to self-reported race. Blood magnesium levels and dietary magnesium intake were significantly lower in black compared to white men. However, magnesium levels or intake were not associated with risk of total prostate cancer or aggressive prostate cancer. Indeed, a higher calcium-to-magnesium diet intake was significantly protective for high-grade prostate cancer in black (OR = 0.66 (0.45, 0.96), p = 0.03) but not white (OR = 1.00 (0.79, 1.26), p = 0.99) men. In summary, there was a statistically significant difference in magnesium intake between black and white men, but the biological impact was unclear, and we did not confirm a lower prostate cancer risk associated with magnesium levels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumors is a major challenge in colon cancer chemotherapy. To overcome this bottleneck, we loaded camptothecin (CPT) into polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), and further functionalized their surface with chondroitin sulfate (CS). The resulting CS-CPT-NPs had a desirable hydrodynamic diameter (289 nm), narrow particle size distribution (polydispersity index = 0.192) and neutral surface charge. Furthermore, in vitro experiments revealed that the surface functionalization of CS endowed NPs with the capacity of colon cancer-targeted drug delivery, and significantly improved the anti-colon cancer activities and pro-apoptosis effects against colon cancer cells. Strikingly, treatment of colon tumor-bearing mice with different NPs clearly indicated that CS-CPT-NPs showed much better therapeutic outcomes than non-targeted NPs and no systemic toxicity. Taken together, these results demonstrated the promising potential of CS-CPT-NP as an effective drug delivery system for colon cancer-targeted chemotherapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer mortality and cancer cell migration is an essential stage of metastasis. We identified benproperine (Benp, a clinically used antitussive drug) as an inhibitor of cancer cell migration and an anti-metastatic agent. Benp selectively inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion, which also suppressed metastasis of cancer cells in animal models. Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 (ARPC2) was identified as a molecular target of Benp by affinity column chromatography with Benp-tagged Sepharose beads. Benp bound directly to ARPC2 in cells, which was validated by pull-down assay using Benp-biotin and label-free biochemical methods such as the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Benp inhibited Arp2/3 function, showing disruption of lamellipodial structure and inhibition of actin polymerization. Unlike Arp2/3 inhibitors, Benp selectively inhibited the migration of cancer cells but not normal cells. ARPC2-knockdown cancer cells showed defective cell migration and suppressed metastasis in an animal model. Therefore, ARPC2 is a potential target for anti-metastatic therapy, and Benp has the clinical potential to block metastasis. Furthermore, Benp is a useful agent for studying the functions of the Arp2/3 complex in cancer cell migration and metastasis. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Liver cancer is one of the leading cause of death in all over the world. Detecting the cancer tissue manually is a difficult task and time consuming. Hence, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is used in decision making process for accurate detection for appropriate therapy. Therefore the main objective of this work is to detect the liver cancer accurately using automated method. Methods: In this work, we have proposed a new system called as watershed Gaussian based deep learning (WGDL) technique for effective delineate the cancer lesion in computed tomography (CT) images of the liver. A total of 225 images were used in this work to develop the proposed model. Initially, the liver was separated using marker controlled watershed segmentation process and finally the cancer affected lesion was segmented using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithm. After tumor segmentation, various texture features were extracted from the segmented region. These segmented features were fed to deep neural network (DNN) classifier for automated classification of three types of liver cancer i.e. hemangioma (HEM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic carcinoma (MET). Results: We have achieved a classification accuracy of 99.38%, Jaccard index of 98.18%, at 200 epochs using DNN classifier with a negligible validation loss of 0.062 during the classification process. Conclusions: Our developed system is ready to be tested with huge database and can aid the radiologist in detecting the liver cancer using CT images. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Mounting studies show that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) could affect human cancer progression, including bladder cancer (BCa). LncRNA DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 5 (DGCR5) has been proven to be involved in lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the function of DGCR5 in BCa remains largely unknown. Here, we found that DGCR5 expression was significantly downregulated in BCa tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Higher expression of DGCR5 predicted higher survival rate in BCa patients. Functional experiments indicated that DGCR5 overexpression markedly inhibited that proliferation, colony formation, and cell-cycle progression in BCa cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of DGCR5 led to decreased BCa cell migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition while promoting apoptosis. In vivo xenograft assay also illustrated that DGCR5 overexpression inhibited BCa growth. In the mechanism, we found that DGCR5 interacted with AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A), a chromatin remodeling protein, to promote P21 transcription. Knockdown of P21 could significantly rescue the suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of BCa cells by DGCR5 overexpression. In summary, our study demonstrated that DGCR5 transcriptionally promotes P21 expression to suppress BCa progression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: N-nitroso compounds (NOC) formed endogenously after nitrate/nitrite ingestion and disinfection by-products (DBPs) are suspected colorectal carcinogens, but epidemiologic evidence of these associations is limited. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between drinking water exposures and incident colorectal cancers in a cohort of postmenopausal women. Methods: Using historical nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) measurements and estimates of total trihalomethanes (TTHM), the sum of 5 or 6 haloacetic acids (HAAs), and individual DBPs in public water supplies (PWS), we computed average exposures and years of exposure above one-half the U.S. maximum contaminant level (&gt;1/2-MCL; &gt;5 mg/L NO 3 -N and &gt;40 μg/L TTHM). Nitrate/nitrite intakes from dietary sources were estimated using a food frequency questionnaire. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from Cox regression models. We assessed NO 3 -N interactions with DBPs and with factors influencing endogenous NOC formation. Results: We identified 624 colon and 158 rectal cancers (1986–2010) among 15,910 women reporting PWS use &gt;10 years. Ingestion of NO 3 -N from drinking water was not associated with risk. Colon cancer risks were non-significantly associated with the average TTHM levels &gt;17.7 μg/L (HR Q5vsQ1 = 1.13, CI = 0.89–1.44; p trend = 0.11) and were elevated for any duration of exposure &gt;1/2-MCL. Rectal cancer risks were associated with the highest TTHM levels (HR Q5vsQ1 = 1.71, CI = 1.00–2.92; p trend = 0.22) but not with years &gt;1/2-MCL. Bromodichloromethane (HR Q4vsQ1 = 1.89, CI = 1.17–3.00; p trend = 0.09) and trichloroacetic acid (HR Q4vsQ1 = 1.92, CI = 1.20–3.09; p trend = 0.18) levels were also associated with risk of rectal cancer. We found no evidence of interaction between TTHM and NO 3 -N on the risk of either cancer. Dietary analyses yielded a positive colon cancer association with red meat, but not with processed meat intake or estimated nitrate/nitrite from specific dietary sources. Conclusions: Our results suggest that exposure to TTHM in drinking water is associated with increased risk of rectal cancer. Positive findings for individual THMs and HAAs for both colon and rectal cancers require replication in other studies. We found no associations for nitrate overall or in subgroups with presumed higher NOC exposure. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Improving cell uptake of metal compounds has became an important goal in the field of metal-based anticancer agents. This may combat platinum resistance and side effects seen commonly in current anticancer chemotherapy regimes. Here, we explore a novel degradable ruthenium-albumin hydrogel, which shows strong luminescence for cell imaging and high selectivity for cancer cells versus non-cancer cells. This is an early indication of the possibility of reducing unwanted side effects of metals by using bovine serum albumin hydrogel as a delivery strategy. This work provides a strong basis for development of a new class of metal-based cancer therapeutic agents. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Adverse effects are pressing challenges produced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Nontoxic herbal medicines are therefore considered as a favorable alternative. Astragalus membranaceus has attracted growing interest in the field of biomedicine thanks to its various biological activities, among which the anticancer activity is considered to be closely associated with its active component-astragalus polysaccharide (APS). Currently, direct anti-tumor activity and the activation of immune response of the host have been widely acknowledged as the mechanism by which APS exerts its anti-cancer activity. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether APS could inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells and activate macrophages to further kill cancer cells. The results indicated that the obtained APS was a pyran-type polysaccharide, containing 89.75% total carbohydrate and a minor amount of uronic acid (9.3%). Although APS did not significantly inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells growth, encouragingly, APS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages present anti-cancer activity as evidenced by (a) cell proliferation inhibition (with an inhibitory rate of 41%), (b) G1-phase cell cycle arrest, as well as (c) the regulation of apoptosis-related genes (Bax/Bcl-2, 13.26-fold increase than untreated cells). In addition, APS could upregulate the level of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which acted as inducers of tumor cell apoptosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that APS can activate macrophages to release NO and TNF-α which directly blocks cancer cell growth. The anti-breast cancer effect of APS and the in vivo mechanism will be further elucidated with a review to provide a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies have proven several promising anticancer activities for cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) against a wide range of cancer cells in vitro. Recently, media treated with CAP have also found to effectively eradicate cancer cells similar to the CAP. Based on advantages, many researchers prefer to apply CAP-activated media (PAM) as an alternative to cap in the treatment of cancer. However, less has been achieved regarding the anticancer effects and anticancer mechanisms of PAM. Investigating the selective anticancerous activities of PAM, the viability of SKBR3, MCF7, ASPC-1, A-549, G-292, and SW742 cancer cell lines, as well as normal human skin fibroblasts (FMGB-1) and MCF10A cells in relation to the media activation time, and the length of exposure was studied. Also, we examined the concentration of ozone in media as a function to CAP activation time since recent studies have proposed ozone as a pivotal reactive species in the induction of cell death. Based on the result, both increasing the duration of media activation time and the length of exposure to PAM could significantly increase the anticancer activity. Nevertheless, the cytotoxicity on normal cells was either not affected or slightly increased. Among the six tested cancer cell lines, SW742 was the most resistant and SKBR3 the most susceptible cancer cell lines to PAM. Also, increasing duration of treatment with CAP resulted in a significant rise in O 3 concentration levels in media. Overall, these results suggest PAM, as a promising tool in the treatment of different cancers and O 3 formation as a probable underlying mechanism. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "ProNGF expression has been linked to several types of cancers including breast cancer, and we have previously shown that proNGF stimulates breast cancer invasion in an autocrine manner through membrane receptors sortilin and TrkA. However, little is known regarding TrkA-associated protein partners upon proNGF stimulation. By proteomic analysis and proximity ligation assays, we found that proNGF binding to sortilin induced sequential formation of the functional sortilin/TrkA/EphA2 complex, leading to TrkA-phosphorylation dependent Akt activation and EphA2-dependent Src activation. EphA2 inhibition using siRNA approach abolished proNGF-stimulated clonogenic growth of breast cancer cell lines. Combinatorial targeting of TrkA and EphA2 dramatically reduced colony formation in vitro, primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination towards the brain in vivo. Finally, proximity ligation assay in breast tumor samples revealed that increased TrkA/EphA2 proximity ligation assay signals were correlated with a decrease of overall survival in patients. All together, these data point out the importance of TrkA/EphA2 functional association in proNGF-induced tumor promoting effects, and provide a rationale to target proNGF/TrkA/EphA2 axis by alternative methods other than the simple use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BAG3 is a member of the cochaperone BAG family and often highly expressed in various cancers. Recently, evidences show that BAG3 promotes stemness of human cancer cells. IFN-stimulated genes 15 (ISG15) is an ubiquitin-like molecule, which is covalently conjugated with substrates to form ISGylated proteins. Global screening BAG3 interacting partners demonstrated that ISG15 might be a potential binding partner. The current study revealed that BAG3 did not interact with ISG15, but positively regulated ISG15 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC). It was further found that BAG3 deletion stabilized ISG15 mRNAs, while suppressed its translation via increasing Serine phosphorylation of Ago2 at position 387 (S387). Both BAG3 deletion and ISG15 knockdown suppressed stem cell-like phenotypes of PDAC cells, including clonogenicity, invasiveness and spheroid formation. In addition, ectopic ISG15 expression rescued the suppressive role of BAG3 deletion in cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotypes of PDAC cells, and this effect of ISG15 was independent of its ISGylation function. The current study implies that BAG3 and ISG15 may provide a therapeutic advantage for PDAC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type VI collagen (COL6) is associated with several pro-tumorigenic events. COL6 is primarily composed of three alpha-chains (a1-a3) forming a specialized microfibrillar network to support tissue architecture. COL6 homeostasis is lost in the tumor due to increased COL6 synthesis by activated fibroblast and altered proteolytic degradation by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Consequently, pathology-specific COL6 fragments are released to the circulation. This study evaluates four COL6 fragments measured in serum as potential biomarkers for cancer. METHODS: C6Ma1 (MMP-generated neo-epitope on the a1 chain), C6Ma3 (MMP-generated neo-epitope on the a3 chain), PRO-C6 (C-terminal of the a3 chain) and IC-6 (internal epitope on the a1 chain) were measured by ELISA in serum from patients with various stage 1–4 cancer indications (n = 4–11 per indication, total n = 65) and healthy controls (n = 13). RESULTS: C6Ma1 and C6Ma3 were significantly elevated in most cancer types compared to controls; PRO-C6 and IC6 were not. No significant differences were seen according to age, gender and TNM stage. Comparing cancer patients to controls, the AUROC was 0.90 (P <.0001), 0.87 (P <.0001), 0.59 (P =.311) and 0.53 (P =.747) for C6Ma1, C6Ma3, PRO-C6 and IC-6, respectively. Only C6M and C6Ma3 correlated significantly (Spearman, r = 0.74, P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: MMP-generated COL6 fragments (C6Ma1, C6Ma3) were elevated in serum from cancer patients compared to controls and had promising diagnostic accuracy. This supports that MMP-mediated COL6 remodeling is important in tumorigenesis and indicate cancer biomarker potential of quantifying COL-6 fragments in serum. Future studies should determine biological and clinical applicability of the COL-6 serum biomarkers in relation to cancer. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gene fusions and products have been identified as oncogenic drivers in many cancers, making them attractive diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. However, the landscape of fusion transcripts in bladder cancer has not been fully characterized. Methods: To identify fusion transcripts with potential therapeutic or diagnostic values, TCGA bladder urothelial carcinoma RNA-sequencing dataset was used. In order to avoid false positives, we applied multiple criteria including filtering out fusions detected in normal samples from GTEx dataset. We validated a subset of candidate fusions with a collection of bladder cancer and adjacent normal samples. Result: We identified 19,547 high confidence fusion genes from 414 bladder cancer samples. After filtering off M/M fusions, fusions in GTEx normal samples, and occurrence frequency <5, we obtained a list of 271 gene fusions, 13 of which were novel and specific to cancer samples. Six of those fusions were validated using cell lines and clinical samples. We discovered that two chimeric RNAs, BCL2L2-PABPN1 and CHFR-GOLGA3, were detected to be expressed significantly higher in bladder cancer samples compared to adjacent normal samples. Impressively, the wild-type of the parental genes were not differentially expressed. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these two fusions are generated by cis-splicing between adjacent genes. These two fusions were detected mainly in the fraction of cell nucleus, suggesting a potential long noncoding RNA role. Conclusion: Our findings provide a panoramic view of the landscape of chimeric RNAs in bladder cancer. Some frequent chimeric RNAs are generated by intergenic splicing, and represent a new repertoire for potential biomarkers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Evidence-based guidelines recommend adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage breast cancer whenever treatment benefit is considered sufficient to outweigh the associated risks. However, many groups of patients were either excluded from or underrepresented in the clinical trials that form the evidence base for this recommendation. This study aims to determine whether using administrative health care data—real world data—and econometric methods for causal analysis to provide “real world evidence” (RWE) are feasible methods for addressing this gap. Methods: Cases of primary breast cancer in women from 2001 to 2015 were extracted from the Scottish cancer registry (SMR06) and linked to other routine health records (inpatient and outpatient visits). Four methods were used to estimate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-specific and overall mortality: (1) regression with adjustment for covariates, (2) propensity score matching, (3) instrumental variables analysis, and (4) regression discontinuity design. Hazard ratios for breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality were compared to those from a meta-analysis of randomized trials. Results: A total of 39,805 cases were included in the analyses. Regression adjustment, propensity score matching, and instrumental variables were feasible, whereas regression discontinuity was not. Effectiveness estimates were similar between RWE and randomized trials for breast cancer mortality but not for all-cause mortality. Conclusions: RWE methods are a feasible means to generate estimates of effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage breast cancer. However, such estimates must be interpreted in the context of the available randomized evidence and the potential biases of the observational methods. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a critical reason of cancer chemotherapy failure. Ribophorin II (RPN2) has emerged as a vital regulator of MDR in multiple cancers including gastric cancer (GC). However, the roles and molecular mechanisms of RPN2 in MDR have not been well featured till now. The present study aimed to explore the roles and molecular mechanisms of RPN2 in MDR of drug-resistant GC cells. Results showed that the expressions of RPN2, multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1), and ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) were upregulated in SGC7901/DDP and SGC7901/VCR cells. Knockdown of RPN2 alleviated MDR through downregulating MDR1 and ABCG2 expressions in SGC7901/DDP and SGC7901/VCR cells. RPN2 depletion inhibited the activation of MEK/ERK pathway. RPN2 overexpression enhanced MDR by upregulating P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and ABCG2 protein expressions in SGC7901/DDP or SGC7901/VCR cells, while this effect of RPN2 was abrogated by ERK knockdown or treatment with ERK inhibitor PD98059. Our findings suggested that RPN2 potentiated P-gp- and ABCG2-mediated MDR via activating MEK/ERK pathway in GC, hinting the critical values of RPN2 in ameliorating MDR and providing a promising target for GC therapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common malignant tumor with poor clinical outcome among women. Identification of novel biomarkers could be beneficial for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of CC. This study aimed to identify prognostic biomarkers for the prediction of prognostic status of CC patients, and explore the effect of the corresponding methylated genes in the occurrence and development of CC. The methylation microarray data of CC was extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The methylation genes associated with the prognostic status were identified based on the information of the relapse-free survival (RFS) of the CC patients. The prognostic gene pairs were further identified. Then, the prognostic signature was identified by the forward search algorithm based on the C-index method. The results were validated by independent dataset. Finally, the functional analysis was performed on the methylation genes. A total of 276 methylation genes and 2508 gene pairs associated with the prognostic status of the CC were identified. A signature composed of eight methylation gene pairs was obtained to predict the prognostic status of cervical patients. A series of genes that played an important role in the occurrence and development of CC were obtained by the functional enrichment analysis. To summary, a prognostic signature consisting of eight methylation gene pairs was obtained. Of note, the CD28 and PTEN gene pair were found to play important roles in the occurrence and development of CC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Chloride channel-3 (ClC-3), a member of the ClC family of voltage-gated Cl − channels, is involved in the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we report a new mechanism for ClC-3 in mediating multidrug resistance (MDR). ClC-3 was highly expressed in the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-dependent human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549)/paclitaxel (PTX) and the human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7)/doxorubicin (DOX) resistant cells. Changes in the ClC-3 expression resulted in the development of drug resistance in formerly drug-sensitive A549 or MCF-7 cells, and drug sensitivity in formerly drug-resistant A549/Taxol and MCF-7/DOX cells. Double transgenic MMTV-PyMT/CLCN3 mice with spontaneous mammary cancer and ClC-3 overexpression demonstrated drug resistance to PTX and DOX. ClC-3 expression upregulated the expression of MDR1 messenger RNA and P-gp by activating the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-signaling pathway. These data suggest that ClC-3 expression in cancer cells induces MDR by upregulating NF-κB-signaling-dependent P-gp expression involving another new mechanism for ClC-3 in the development of drug resistance of cancers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Progestins has been used widely for endometrial cancer (EC) patients. However, long term use of high dose progestin often lead to progestin resistance. Our previous studies have demonstrated that metformin reversed progestin resistance through the downregulation of the expression of glyoxalase I (GLOI) in type I endometrial cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) in endometrial cancer, but the physiological role of TET1 in GLOI-mediated progestin resistance has been poorly addressed. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of TET1, GLOI and 5hmC in various endometrium. Western blot was carried out to analyses TET1 and GLOI expression with different treatment. Cell counting kit-8 was used to evaluate cell proliferation after various treatment. Dot blot assay and HMeDIP assay were performed to detect global hydroxmethylation levels and hydroxymethylation levels in GLOI gene respectively. In current study, we found that metformin effectively sensitized progestin in endometrial cancer cell lines through the down regulation of the expression of TET1 and GLOI. Interestingly, the exogenous increase of TET1 expression enhanced total 5hmC level and hydroxymethylation modification in glyoxalase I promoter region. This effect was abated by metformin treatment. Moreover, the expression profile of TET1 and glyoxalase I in various endometrial tissue parallelized with 5hmC level. Therefore, this finding suggests that metformin sensitized progestin in endometrial cancer through the TET1-5hmC-GLOI signaling pathway. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "A new series of biphenyl methylene indolinones has been designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines like DU-145 (prostate cancer cell line), 4T1 (mouse breast cancer cell line), MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer cell line), BT-549 (human breast cancer cell line), T24 (human urinary bladder carcinoma cell line), and HeLa (cervical cancer cell line). Among the series, compound 10e showed potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against HeLa and DU-145 cancer cell lines with IC50 value of 1.74 ± 0.69 µM and 1.68 ± 1.06 µM respectively. To understand the underlying mechanism of most potent cytotoxic compound 10e, various mechanistic studies were carried out on DU-145 cell lines. Cell cycle analysis results revealed that these conjugates affect both G0/G1 and G2/M phase of the cycle, tubulin binding assay resulted that compound 10e interrupting microtubule network formation by inhibiting tubulin polymerization with IC50 value of 4.96 ± 0.05 μM. Moreover, molecular docking of 10e on colchicine binding site of the tubulin explains the interaction of 10e with tubulin. Clonogenic assay indicated inhibition of colony formation by compound 10e in a dose dependent manner. In addition, morphological changes were clearly observed by AO/EB and DAPI staining studies. Moreover, ROS detection using DCFDA, JC-1, and annexin V-FITC assays demonstrated the significant apoptosis induction by 10e. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Capecitabine-based radiochemotherapy (cbRCT) is standard for preoperative long-course radiochemotherapy of locally advanced rectal cancer. This prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial investigated two intensification regimens. cT4 lesions were excluded. Primary objective: pathological outcome (TRG 1-2) among arms. Materials and methods: Low-located cT2N0–2M0, cT3N0–2M0 (up to 12 cm from anal verge) presentations were treated with cbRCT randomly intensified by either radiotherapy boost (Xelac arm) or multidrug concomitant chemotherapy (Xelox arm). Xelac: concomitant boost to bulky site (45 Gy/1.8 Gy/die, 5 sessions/week to the pelvis, +10 Gy at 1 Gy twice/week to the bulky) plus concurrent capecitabine (1650 mg/mq/die). Xelox: 45 Gy to the pelvis + 5.4 Gy/1.8 Gy/die, 5 sessions/week to the bulky site + concurrent capecitabine (1300 mg/mq/die) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/mq on days 1,19,38). Surgery was planned 7–9 weeks after radiochemotherapy. Results: From June 2005 to September 2013, 534 patients were analysed: 280 in Xelac, 254 in Xelox arm. Xelox arm presented higher G ≥ 3 haematologic (p = 0.01) and neurologic toxicity (p < 0.001). Overall, 98.5% patients received curative surgery. The tumour regression grade distribution did not differ between arms (p = 0.102). TRG 1+2 rate significantly differed: Xelac arm 61.7% vs. Xelox 52.3% (p = 0.039). Pathological complete response (ypT0N0) rates were 24.4 and 23.8%, respectively (p non-significant). Median follow-up:5.62 years. Five-year disease-free survival rate were 74.7% (Xelac) and 73.8% (Xelox), respectively (p = 0.444). Five-year overall survival rate were 80.4% (Xelac) and 85.5% (Xelox), respectively (p = 0.155). Conclusion: Xelac arm significantly obtained higher TRG1-2 rates. No differences were found about clinical outcome. Because of efficacy on TRG, inferior toxicity and good compliance, Xelac schedules or similar radiotherapy dose intensification schemes could be considered as reference treatments for cT3 lesions. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Gene-silencing with targeted siRNAs has great potential as a therapeutic approach for various diseases including cancer. However, intracellular delivery of siRNA is challenging. We used bovine milk exosomes as a novel system for siRNA delivery. First, we demonstrated that exosomes can deliver endogenous RNA payloads into recipient cells. Next, we loaded siRNA against specific genes including VEGF, EGFR, AKT, MAPK, and KRAS. We utilized 5′ −32 P-labeled siKRAS as a tracer and found exosome loading with siRNA could be variable. We demonstrated that the siRNA of loaded exosomes is stable and resist degradation. Our results indicated that siRNAs against target genes ranged from 2 to 10-fold knockdown in expression levels in various cancers. Since mutated KRAS has been implicated in the development of various cancers including lung cancer, we tested a mutant-allele specific siRNA against KRAS G12S , in A549 cells. We observed a dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity against A549 cells treated with exosomes carrying siKRAS G12S . We observed significant inhibition of A549 tumor xenografts in animals treated with folic acid-functionalized exosomes carrying siKRAS. In summary, milk-derived exosomes represent a viable natural nano-carrier for the delivery of siRNA for therapeutic application against cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A significant contributor to women's cancer mortality worldwide is cervical cancer, which is caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV). The two viral oncoproteins of HR HPV, E6 and E7, partner with host cell proteins to target oncogenic proteins and pathways. Previously, we have shown HR HPV type 16 E6 (16E6) interacts with the host protein NFX1-123 to target telomerase and cellular immortalization, requiring NFX1-123 to fully upregulate telomerase activity. We now report that NFX1-123 is highly expressed in primary cervical cancers. In vitro, cells expressing 16E6 and overexpressing NFX1-123 have extended active growth, decreased senescence marker staining, and more rapid cell cycling compared to 16E6 expressing cells with endogenous amounts of NFX1-123. These findings were associated with increased telomerase activity and augmented expression of its catalytic subunit, hTERT. In complement, HPV 16 positive cervical cancer cell lines with knocked down NFX1-123 had slowed growth and reduced hTERT over time. In cells that express HR HPV E6, greater expression of NFX1-123 can modify active cellular growth and augment hTERT expression and telomerase activity over time, potentially supporting the initiation and progression of HPV-associated cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is a dangerous disease that causes death worldwide. Discovering few genes relevant to one cancer disease can result in effective treatments. The challenge associated with the Microarray datasets is its high dimensionality; the huge number of features compared to the modest number of samples in these datasets. Recent research efforts attempted to reduce this high-dimensionality using different feature selection techniques. This paper presents an ensemble feature selection technique based on t-test and genetic algorithm. After preprocessing the data using t-test, a Nested Genetic Algorithm, namely Nested-GA, is used to get the optimal subset of features by combining data from two different datasets. Nested-GA consists of two Nested Genetic Algorithms (outer and inner) that run on two different kinds of datasets. The Outer Genetic Algorithm (OGA-SVM) works on Microarray gene expression datasets, whereas the Inner Genetic Algorithm (IGA-NNW) runs on DNA Methylation datasets. Nested-GA is performed on a colon cancer dataset with 5-fold cross validation. After applying Nested-GA, the Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) strategy is used to get the smallest optimal genes subset. The genes subset has been validated on an independent dataset resulting in 99.9% classification accuracy. Consequently, the biological significance of the resulting optimal genes is validated using Enrichment Analysis. Moreover, the results of Nested-GA have been compared to the results of other feature selection algorithms that have been run on either Gene Expression or DNA Methylation datasets. From the experimental results, Nested-GA showed the highest classification performance with a small optimal feature subset compared to the other algorithms. Furthermore, by running Nested-GA on lung cancer datasets that contain two different cancer subtypes, it resulted in significantly better classification accuracy (98.4%) compared to the accuracy of a previous research (84.6%) that utilized lung cancer DNA-Methylation data only. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Esophageal cancer ranks the eighth most common cancer and the sixth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate a wide variety of cancer-related cellular processes. In the current study, a series of previously published gene expression microarray data from Gene Expression Ominus and The Cancer Genome Atlas were downloaded and further divided into training, internal, and external validation sets. Least absolute shrinkage and selectionator operator Cox regression model along with 10-fold cross-validation was performed to select the miRNAs associated with the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and constructed a six-miRNA signature. Then the prediction accuracy of this signature was assessed in validation and test set using Kaplan–Meier analysis, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and dynamic area under the ROC curve. According to the result, the prediction accuracy of miRNA signature was much better than that of tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) stage in all the three sets. Stratified analysis also demonstrated that the predict ability of this signature was independent of TNM stage. Finally, function experiments including apoptosis and colony formation assay were performed to further reveal the regulatory role of miRNAs in ESCC. Our study demonstrated the promising potential application of this novel six-miRNA signature as an independent biomarker for survival prediction of ESCC patients. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Human metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a long non-coding RNA known to be highly expressed in several tumors. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MALAT1 promotes cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MALAT1 on the proliferation, migration, and drug sensitivity of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo and the mechanisms involved therein. We observed increased expression of MALAT1 in six CRC cell lines compared to that in normal cells, suggesting its involvement in CRC progression. Downregulation of MALAT1 inhibited cell migration and induced apoptosis in vitro and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Furthermore, MALAT1 silencing downregulated the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multi-drug resistance proteins including MDR1 and MRP1, resulting in decreased resistance of cancer cells to 5-FU. In addition, the metastasis and invasion of HCT-116 and HCT-116/5-FU cells were regulated via targeting miR-20b-5p. Based on these observations, we infer that inhibition of MALAT1 suppressed CRC progression and metastasis and improved the sensitivity of cancer cells to 5-FU. The present study proposes a new direction to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the invasion and metastasis of CRC, whereby the interaction between MALAT1 and miR-20b-5p could be a novel therapeutic target for CRC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: The first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy resulted in a clinical efficacy for Chinese patients with advanced nonsquamous non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Some economic analyses have carried out various methods to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab as the first-line treatment for NSCLC in other countries. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for the first-line treatment of advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Methods: A Markov model was applied from the perspective of the Chinese health care system to assess cost-effectiveness. It was based on the clinical trial BEYOND that compared bevacizumab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (B+CP) with placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (PI+CP) for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Ten-year quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed. Results: QALYs were 1.17 years in the B+CP group and 0.83 years in the PI+CP group, resulting in a difference of 0.34 years. The ICER was $130,937.09/QALY, which was far beyond the willing-to-pay threshold of $24,314/QALY. At a threshold of $130,584/QALY, addition of bevacizumab had a 50% probability of being cost-effective. Conclusions: Bevacizumab is not cost-effective when combined with chemotherapy for patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC based on the Chinese health care system, resulting in a less demand in the Chinese market. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most fatal cancers in the world. Thousands of biomarkers have been explored that might be related to survival and prognosis via database mining. However, the prediction effect of single gene biomarkers is not specific enough. Increasing evidence suggests that gene signatures are emerging as a possible better alternative. We aimed to develop a novel gene signature to improve the prognosis prediction of GC. Using the messenger RNA (mRNA)-mining approach, we performed mRNA expression profiling in a large GC cohort (n = 375) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed, and we recovered genes related to the G2/M checkpoint, which we identified with a Cox proportional regression model. We identified a set of five genes (MARCKS, CCNF, MAPK14, INCENP, and CHAF1A), which were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in the test series. Based on this five-gene signature, the test series patients could be classified into high-risk or low-risk subgroups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the prognostic power of this five-gene signature was independent of clinical features. In conclusion, we developed a five-gene signature related to the cell cycle that can predict survival for GC. Our findings provide novel insight that is useful for understanding cell cycle mechanisms and for identifying patients with GC with poor prognoses. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor initiation, metastasis and recurrence. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a major protein of caveolae, which participates in various cellular functions, such as vesicle trafficking, cholesterol homeostasis, tumor progression, etc. In the present study, we investigated a role for Cav-1 in regulating the stemness of human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Cav-1 expression was significantly lower in tumorspheres than in adherent cells. The silencing of Cav-1 enhanced stemness of MDA-MB-231 cells. Mechanistically, Cav-1 silencing was accompanied by enhanced expression of Bmi-1, which is a representative self-renewal regulator, and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In a CSC-like state, reduced Cav-1 depends on its destabilization through ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. We further found that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Cav-1 at the Tyr 14 residue is essential for its degradation. Taken together, these findings suggest that Cav-1 destabilization by Src may play a pivotal role in manifestation and maintenance of stemness in breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "While chemically and thermally modified citrus pectin (MCP) has already been studied for health benefits, it is unknown how size-fractionated oligo- and polysaccharides differentially affect cancer cell behavior. We produced thermally MCP and fractionated it by molecular size to evaluate the effect these polymers have on cancer cells. MCP30/10 (between 30 and 10 kDa) had more esterified homogalacturonans (HG) and fewer rhamnogalacturonans (RG-I) than MCP and MCP30 (higher than 30 kDa), while MCP10/3 (between 10 and 3 kDa) showed higher amounts of type I arabinogalactans (AGI) and lower amounts of RG-I. MCP3 (smaller than 3 kDa) presented less esterified HG and the lowest amount of AGI and RG-I. Our data indicate that the enrichment of de-esterified HG oligomers and the AGI and RG-I depletions in MCP3, or the increase of AGI and loss of RGI in MCP30/10, enhance the anticancer behaviors by inhibiting migration, aggregation, and proliferation of cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the ultrasound (US) response in patients with breast cancer (BC) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: Prospective US analysis was performed on 19 malignant tumors prior to NAC treatment and 7 days after each first four courses of NAC in 13 patients (median age = 57 years). Echogenicity, size, vascularity, and sonoelastography were measured and compared with posttreatment scores of residual cancers burden. Results: Changes in the echogenicity of tumors after 3 courses of NAC had the most statistically strong correlation with the percentage of residual malignant cells used in histopathology to assess the response to treatment (odds ratio = 60, p < 0.05). Changes in lesion size and elasticity were also significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions: There is a statistically significant relationship between breast tumors’ echogenicity in US, neoplasm size, and stiffness and the response to NAC. In particular, our results show that the change in tumor echogenicity could predict a pathological response with satisfactory accuracy and may be considered in NAC monitoring. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Liver cancer is quite common type of cancer among individuals worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the malignancy of liver cancer. It has high impact on individual's life and investigating it early can decline the number of annual deaths. This study proposes a new machine learning approach to detect HCC using 165 patients. Ten well-known machine learning algorithms are employed. In the preprocessing step, the normalization approach is used. The genetic algorithm coupled with stratified 5-fold cross-validation method is applied twice, first for parameter optimization and then for feature selection. In this work, support vector machine (SVM) (type C-SVC) with new 2level genetic optimizer (genetic training) and feature selection yielded the highest accuracy and F 1 -Score of 0.8849 and 0.8762 respectively. Our proposed model can be used to test the performance with huge database and aid the clinicians. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "To overcome low therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy against multidrug resistance (MDR) breast cancer, a combination therapy system based upon functionalized polymer nanoparticles comprising poly(γ-glutamic acid)-g-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (γ-PGA-g-PLGA) as the major component was developed. The NPs were loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and indocyanine green (ICG) for dual modality cancer treatment and coated with cholesterol-PEG (C-PEG) for MDR abrogation in treatment of human MDR breast cancer. The in vitro cellular uptake of the DOX/ICG loaded nanoparticles (DI-NPs) by MDR cancer cells was significantly enhanced owing to effective inhibition of the P-gp activity by C-PEG and γ-PGA receptor-mediated endocytosis. DOX localization in cytoplasm and nucleus was observed particularly with the photo-thermal effect that facilitated intracellular drug release. As a result, the C-PEG coated DI-NPs after photo-irradiation exhibited a synergistic effect of combination (chemo/thermal) therapy to depress the proliferation of MDR cancer calls. The ex vivo biodistribution study revealed an enhanced tumor accumulation of C-PEG (2000) coated DI-NPs in MCF-7/MDR tumor-bearing nude mice due to the excellent EPR effects by the NP surface PEGylation. The MDR tumor growth was almost entirely inhibited in the group receiving combination therapy from CP2k-DI-NPs and photo-irradiation along with substantial cell apoptosis of tumor tissues examined by immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrate a promising dual modality therapy system, CP2k-DI-NPs, developed in this work for effective combination therapy of human MDR breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the impact of double reading automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) when added to full field digital mammography (FFDM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) for breast cancer screening. Methods: From April 2014 to June 2015, 124 women with dense breasts and intermediate to high breast cancer risk were recruited for screening with FFDM, DBT, and ABUS. Readers used FFDM and DBT in clinical practice and received ABUS training prior to study initiation. FFDM or DBT were first interpreted alone by two independent readers and then with ABUS. All recalled women underwent diagnostic workup with at least one year of follow-up. Recall rates were compared using the sign test; differences in outcomes were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Results: Of 121 women with complete follow-up, all had family (35.5%) or personal (20.7%) history of breast cancer, or both (43.8%). Twenty-four women (19.8%) were recalled by at least one modality. Recalls increased from 5.0% to 13.2% (p = 0.002) when ABUS was added to FFDM and from 3.3% to 10.7% (p = 0.004) when ABUS was added to DBT. Findings recalled by both readers were more likely to result in a recommendation for short term follow-up imaging or tissue biopsy compared to findings recalled by only one reader (100% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.041). The cancer detection rate was 8.3 per 1000 screens (1/121); mode of detection: FFDM and DBT. Conclusions: Adding ABUS significantly increased the recall rate of both FFDM and DBT screening. Double reading of ABUS during early phase adoption may reduce false positive recalls. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is one of the major world public health problems and the currently available treatments are nonspecific and ineffective. This reality highlights the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches. In this field, multifunctional nanomedicines have the potential to revolutionize the currently available treatments. These unique nanodevices can simultaneously act as therapeutic and imaging agents allowing the real-time monitoring of the nanoparticles biodistribution and the treatment outcome. Among the different nanoparticles, the gold-core silica shell (AuMSS) nanoparticles advantageous physicochemical and biological properties make them promising nanoplatforms for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, their successful application as an effective cancer nanomedicine is limited by the unfavorable pharmacokinetics and uncontrolled release of the therapeutic payloads. Herein, a new polymeric coating for AuMSS nanospheres was developed by combining different ratios (25/75, 50/50 and 75/25) of two materials, Poly-2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (PEOZ) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). The surface functionalization of AuMSS nanospheres led to a size increase and to the neutralization of the surface charge. On the other side, the nanoparticles biological performance was improved. The coated AuMSS nanospheres showed an increased cytocompatibility and internalization rate by the HeLa cancer cells. Overall, the obtained data confirm the successful modification of the AuMSS nanospheres with PEOZ and β-CD as well as their promising properties for being applied in cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Currently, an increasing evidence showed that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in tumor progression. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in CRC progression remain unclear. In the present study, through circRNA high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we identified that hsa_circ_0136666 was significantly overexpressed in CRC tissues and cell lines. High hsa_circ_0136666 expression was associated with poor overall survival of patients with CRC. In vitro function assays showed that hsa_circ_0136666 inhibition suppressed CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and arrested CRC cells in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, we showed that hsa_circ_0136666 inhibition reduced CRC cell growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we revealed that hsa_circ_0136666 could increase SH2B1 expression via competitively binding miR-136 in CRC cells. In addition, SH2B1 overexpression could reverse the effects of hsa_circ_0136666 inhibition on CRC cell progression. In conclusion, our data suggested that hsa_circ_0136666 could promote CRC cell progression via the miR-136/SH2B1 axis, elucidating a novel approach to improve the effectiveness of CRC treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Growing evidence from recent studies has shown that the X-inactive specific transcript (XIST), a well-known long noncoding RNA involved in early embryonic development, is aberrantly regulated in various human cancers. However, the prognostic value of XIST in cancers remains uncharacterized. In this study, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase to collect all relevant studies, and a meta-analysis was performed to explore the association of XIST expression with overall survival (OS) and clinicopathological parameters. We demonstrated that high XIST expression was associated with poor OS (hazard ratio = 1.76; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.56–1.98; p < 0.001). In addition, increased XIST expression was found to be associated with lymph node metastasis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06; 95% CI, 1.46–1.90; p < 0.001), distant metastasis (OR = 2.93; 95% CI, 2.00–4.28; p < 0.001), tumor size (OR = 2.66; 95% CI, 1.86–3.81; p < 0.001), poor differentiation (OR = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.00–2.10; p = 0.049), and advanced tumor stage (OR = 3.35; 95% CI, 2.25–5.00; p < 0.001), but not with age (OR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.59–1.15; p = 0.251) or gender (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.70–1.19; p = 0.512). Our meta-analysis showed that XIST may be a useful common biomarker for predicting prognosis in patients with cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), characterized by increased expression of proinflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral and antibody-related genes, is upregulated in the context of chronic adversity and distress and has been linked to cancer progression. Several studies suggest that the CTRA may also be down-regulated in association with some positive psychological states, particularly eudaimonic well-being. However, it is not clear if the link between inter-individual differences in the CTRA and eudaimonic well-being can be extended to intra-individual change. Using a standardized mindfulness-based intervention, the current study tested whether mindfulness-related increases in eudaimonic well-being related to intra-individual reduction in the CTRA in a sample of younger breast cancer survivors. Methods: Participants were 22 women who had been diagnosed and treated for early-stage breast cancer at or before age 50 (M age = 46.6 years) and had no evidence of active disease. Women completed self-report questionnaires and provided peripheral blood samples before and after a 6-week mindfulness meditation intervention. Regression analyses were used to quantify associations between the magnitude of change in eudaimonic well-being and the magnitude of change in the global CTRA score. Results: Women reported significant increases in eudaimonic well–being and showed decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory subcomponent of the CTRA from pre- to post-intervention. The magnitude of increase in eudaimonic well-being was associated with the magnitude of decrease in the composite CTRA score, and this relationship was driven primarily by increased expression of the antiviral/antibody-related CTRA subcomponent. While the intervention was also associated with reduced depressive symptoms, there was no association between change in depressive symptoms and change in the overall CTRA composite score or either of its subcomponents. Conclusions: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that eudaimonic well-being may be an important mechanism in interventions aimed at enhancing health in vulnerable groups, and contribute to our understanding of how psychological well-being may influence physical health in cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most diagnosed type of cancer among women for which an exhaustive cure has not been discovered yet. Nowadays, tamoxifen still represents the gold standard for breast cancer therapy; it acts on both estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers. Unfortunately, its toxicity and the related chemoresistance undermine its antitumor potential. In this paper, new tamoxifen-based derivatives with a rigid structural motif in their structure were designed, synthesized, and evaluated to assess their antitumor behavior. All the tested compounds affected estrogen receptor-positive tumor (MCF-7) cell growth, even with different extents, among which, the most active ones proved also to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through activation of PARP cleavage, decrease in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increase in Bim gene expression levels. Here we found that the compound 1, carrying a rigid xanthene core, turned out to be the most promising of the set showing an activity profile comparable to that of tamoxifen. Furthermore, a more favorable genotoxic profile than tamoxifen made compound 1 a promising candidate for further studies. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In tumor biology, it is widely recognized that 3D rather than 2D cell culture can recapitulate key features of solid tumors, including cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. In this study, to mimick the ECM of breast cancer, hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels were synthesized from two polyvalent HA derivatives through a hydrazone and photo dual crosslinking process. HA hydrogels could be formed within 120 s. The hydrogels had similar topography and mechanical properties to breast tumor and displayed glutathione and hyaluronidase dual-responsive degradation behavior. Biological studies demonstrated that HA hydrogel could support the proliferation and clustering of breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The expression levels of VEGF, IL-8 and bFGF in hydrogel-cultured cells were significantly greater than those in 2D culture. Moreover, cells from hydrogel culture exhibited greater migration/invasion abilities and tumorigenicity than 2D-cultured cells. Therefore, the HA hydrogels are a promising ECM-mimicking matrix for in vitro construction of breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "IL-17/IL-23 pathway has been hypothesized to play a role in occurrence and progression of gastric cancer. To investigate the susceptibility and prognostic value of polymorphisms in genes in the IL-17/IL-23 pathway to gastric cancer, we performed a case-control study combined a retrospective study in a Chinese population. The Sequenom's MassARRAY ® genotyping platform was used to genotype the polymorphisms, and infection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was determined by using a commercial H. pylori immunogold testing kit. The results showed that IL-17A rs3748067 T allele carriers have a higher gastric cancer risk than non-carriers in the subgroup of individuals with age &gt;64 years old (CT/TT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.04–2.29). The result of prognosis shown that IL-23R rs1884444 GG and rs6682925 CC genotype were associated with unfavorable survival (rs1884444 GG vs. GT/TT: adjusted HR = 1.40, 95%CI:1.02–1.93; rs6682925 CC vs. CT/TT: HR = 1.43, 95%CI:1.06–1.92), respectively. The stratified analysis revealed that the significant association of rs1884444 was maintained in the subgroup of older than 64 years old, and that rs6682925 was associated with unfavorable survival in the subgroup of female and patients received chemotherapy. In short, we concluded two polymorphisms (rs1884444 and rs6682925) in IL-23R were associated with prognosis of gastric cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and sex determining region Y-box 2 (OCT4&SOX2)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor on killing lung cancer stem-like cells (LCSCs) and their efficacy in treating drug-resistant lung cancer (DRLC) mice. OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs and PD-1 inhibitor with differed doses were applied to treat PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) assay with carboxyfluorescein diacetate/succinimidyl ester staining target cells before treatment and propidium iodide (PI) staining dead cells after treatment were conducted to detect the cytotoxic activity. DRLC mice were constructed by injection of PC9 LCSCs suspension and Matrigel into left lung of SD mice. DRLC mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 CTLs group, OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group, PD-1 inhibitor group, and OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group. In vitro, both CCK8 assay and FCM assay disclosed that OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs plus PD-1 inhibitor presented with elevated cytotoxic activity on PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. In vivo, tumor volume and tumor weight were decreased, while tumor necrosis and tumor apoptosis were increased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group than CMV pp65 CTLs group and control group, and in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group. In addition, CD8 expression was increased while OCT4&SOX2 expressions were decreased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group. In conclusion, OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs and PD-1 inhibitor presented with the synergistic effect on killing LCSCs in vitro and treating DRLC mice in vivo. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Pepsinogen I (PG I) and pepsinogen II (PG II) are gastric disease-associated proteins that have been utilized as biomarkers for gastric cancer screening. However, the current methods for detecting PG I and PG II can barely satisfy the needs of mass screening, especially in remote areas. In this study, a rapid and sensitive fluorescent immunochromatographic test strip with a miniature analytical device (20.0 cm × 18.9 cm × 11.2 cm, 2.4 kg) was developed for the simultaneous determination of PG I and PG II in one sample in a single assay, which is promisingly suitable for the mass screening of gastric cancer. Under the optimum conditions, PG I and PG II concentrations as low as 2.6 ng/mL and 1.0 ng/mL could be detected in 15 min with only 7.5 μL plasma specimen, and no cross-reactivity was observed. The detection range was linear over 10.0–210.0 ng/mL for PG I and 3.0–63.0 ng/mL for PG II. The immunosensor also demonstrated high recoveries (93.6–110.8% for PG I and 95.4–110.4% for PG II) with low coefficient of variation (CV) (4.8–8.1% for PG I and 6.6–11.7% for PG II) when testing actual human plasma. The analyses by the proposed assay correlated well with those by ELISA of 30 spiked samples. The assay was finally applied to 30 clinical samples, and the results showed its clinical significance for the early screening of gastric cancer. Therefore, the assay proposed in this study provides a rapid, sensitive, and simultaneous detection strategy in the pepsinogen test, and the results indicated its potential capacity in the mass screening of gastric cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Interfraction shape and position variations of organs at risk (OARs) may increase uncertainty in dose delivery during stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), potentially leading to overirradiation or concessions in planned tumor dose and/or coverage to prevent clinical constraints violation. The aim of our study was to quantitatively analyze the impact of anatomical interfraction variations on dose to OARs in pancreatic cancer (PC) treated by SBRT using a CyberKnife with integrated CT-on-rails. Materials and methods: Thirty-five PC patients treated with SBRT (40 Gy/5 fractions) underwent a CT-scan in treatment position before each of the first three fractions using the CT-on-rails system. OARs (stomach, duodenum, bowel) were manually delineated and concatenated to one structure (Gastro-Intestinal Organ, GIO). To overlay the planned dose distribution, fiducial-based alignment of the fraction CT with the planning CT was performed. Planned DVH parameters of the OAR were compared to the parameters calculated in the fractions CTs. Results: Compared to the treatment plan, the median V35, D2, D5, D10 and Dmax of the fraction CTs in the GIO was increased by 1.0 (IQR: 0.2–2.6), 4.4% (0.4–10.8), 2.3% (0.2–7.5), 3.3% (−0.4 to 7.1), and 12.0% (5.0–18.9) respectively. Median increase was statistically significant for all parameters in GIO and for V35 in all critical structures at Wilcoxon test. Conclusions: Anatomical interfraction variations increase OAR dose during SBRT for pancreatic cancer daily imaging using integrated CT/CyberKnife may allow to implement strategies to reduce the risk of OAR overirradiation during pancreatic SBRT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Palbociclib is a Cdk4/6 inhibitor approved for metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. The drug is also under clinical evaluation for metastatic urothelial cancer and other solid tumors. Preclinical studies from multiple tumor types suggest that other factors also affect the sensitivity of individual tumors to Cdk4/6 inhibitor. We show here that Cdk2 has an essential role in palbociclib antitumor effect against bladder cancers. We found that palbociclib induced apoptosis instead of cell cycle arrest to exhibit its anticancer activity in T24 cells, as was evidenced by membrane blebbing, caspase-3 activation and AIF release from mitochondria. Cdk2 activation was important to palbociclib-induced apoptotic triggering activity, since depletion of Cdk2 significantly inhibited caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis. Cdk2 activation caused p-Rad9 translocation to the mitochondria and subsequently interaction with Bcl-xl, leading to conformational activation of Bak and cell apoptosis. The anticancer activity and Cdk2 activation of palbociclib-treated mice were finally validated in a T24 xenograft model. Collectively, these results together demonstrate that palbociclib exerts its anticancer effect in T24 cells mainly through Cdk2 activation. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular interactions and anticancer mechanisms of Cdk4/6 inhibitors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) using chitosan/fucoidan multilayer coating of gold nanorods (CS/F-GNRs) has emerged as an alternative strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, biocompatible CS/F-GNRs were synthesized as a new generation of photothermal therapeutic agents for in vivo cancer treatments owing to their good biocompatibility, photostability, and strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region. The CS/F-GNRs showed a good size distribution (51.87 ± 3.03 nm), and the temperature variation of the CS/F-GNRs increased by 54.4 °C after laser irradiation (1.0 W/cm 2 ) for 5 min. The in vitro photothermal efficiency of CS/F-GNRs indicated that significantly more cancer cells were killed under laser irradiation at 1.0 W/cm 2 for 5 min. On the 20 th day of treatment, the MDA-MB-231 tumor cells in mice treated with CS/F-GNRs under laser irradiation had almost completely disappeared. Therefore, the biocompatible CS/F-GNRs have shown great promise as safe and highly efficient near-infrared photothermal agents for future cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Inhibition of ubiquitin ligases with small molecule remains a very challenging task, given the lack of catalytic activity of the target and the requirement of disruption of its interactions with other proteins. Siah1/2, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases, are implicated in melanoma and prostate cancer and represent high-value drug targets. We utilized three independent screening approaches in our efforts to identify small-molecule Siah1/2 inhibitors: Affinity Selection-Mass Spectrometry, a protein thermal shift-based assay and an in silico based screen. Inhibitors were assessed for their effect on viability of melanoma and prostate cancer cultures, colony formation, prolyl-hydroxylase-HIF1α signaling, expression of selected Siah2-related transcripts, and Siah2 ubiquitin ligase activity. Several analogs were further characterized, demonstrating improved efficacy. Combination of the top hits identified in the different assays demonstrated an additive effect, pointing to complementing mechanisms that underlie each of these Siah1/2 inhibitors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A fundamental model of tumor growth in the presence of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents is formulated. The model allows to study the role of the Norton-Simon hypothesis in the context of dose-dense chemotherapy. Dose-dense protocols aim at reducing the period between courses of chemotherapy from three weeks to two weeks, in order to avoid tumor regrowth between cycles. We address the conditions under which these protocols might be more or less beneficial in comparison to less dense settings, depending on the sensitivity of the tumor cells to the cytotoxic drugs. The effects of varying other parameters of the protocol, as for example the duration of each continuous drug infusion, are also inspected. We believe that the present model might serve as a foundation for the development of more sophisticated models for cancer chemotherapy. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Aim: This phase IB/II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the addition of cetuximab to standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC). Methods: Patients (pts) with resectable LAEC (T 2-3 N 0-1 M 0 , T 1-3 N 1 M 0 or T 1-3 N 0-1 M 1A) received an induction cycle of cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 , day 1, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1000 mg/m 2 /day, days 1–5, followed 4 weeks later by radiotherapy, 50.4 Gy, given with 2 cycles of cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 and escalating doses of 5-FU, days 1–4 and 29–32. Pts received 10 weekly infusions of cetuximab, 250 mg/m 2 , with a loading dose, 400 mg/m 2 . Surgery was planned 6–8 weeks after CRT. Results: 64 pts were treated and 60 completed CRT. Median age was 65 years and 66% were males. Adenocarcinoma/squamous ratio was 61%/39%. Tumors were advanced: 95% T 3 and 67% N 1 . Grade ≥3 toxicities occurred in 72%, with two (3%) toxic deaths. The 5-FU maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was 1000 mg/m 2 /day. Clinical complete response rate was 33%. Of the 55 operated pts, R0 resection was achieved in 51 (93%) and pathological complete response (pCR) in 18 (33%), with 8 (14%) postoperative deaths. The 5-year survival rate for all pts was 38%. Pts with squamous histology had higher pCR (55% vs 20%, p = 0.015), local control (96% vs. 74%, p &lt; 0.001) and 5-year survival (58% vs 25%, p = 0.011) rates. Conclusions: This study suggests that the addition of cetuximab to standard preoperative CRT is feasible. R0, pCR and local control rates are encouraging. Pts with squamous cell tumors benefited more from the addition of cetuximab. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: It has been known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently overexpressed in cervical cancer. High levels of EGFR expression in their tumors leads to a poor prognosis and inhibition frequently induces autophagy in cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate whether EGFR inhibition by canertinib induces autophagy and this induction influence the effect of Palladium (Pd) (II) complex and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) especially in nontoxic doses. Methods: Cytotoxicity was evaluated by using SRB assay. Apoptosis, autophagy, and EGFR key markers were determined by flow cytometry, fluorescence staining, and immunoblotting. Colony formation, invasion, and wound healing assays were performed to investigate cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, respectively. Results: Blocking EGFR by the pan-ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor canertinib inhibited cell growth of HeLa cervical cancer cells in combination with Pd(II) complex and 5-FU. Combination of canertinib and Pd(II) complex promotes autophagy and apoptosis of HeLa cancer cells via blockade of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathway, which leads to cervical cancer cell death. ROS accumulation and DNA damage were increased after combinatorial treatment which causes depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane and leads to apoptotic cell death. Canertinib combined with Pd(II) complex leads to inhibition of migration and invasion. Conclusion: Inhibition of EGFR signaling by canertinib in combination with Pd(II) complex promotes apoptosis and autophagy via blockade of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK. General significance: The cytotoxic activity of Pd(II) complex and 5-FU on HeLa cells is mediated by EGFR inhibition and autophagy induction, leading to activation of mitochondrial apoptotic cell death. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA-575 (miR-575) is oncogene in many tumors. However, the role of miR-575 in the progression of gastric cancer (GC) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to identify whether miR-575 play a role in the development of GC. We obtained GC cell lines, GC tissues from 40 patients to measure the levels of miR-575 and its predicted target PTEN by using RT‑PCR, immunohistochemistry or western blot analysis. MGC-803 cells were transfected with miR-575 inhibitor, and cells viability and apoptosis were measured. miR-575 aberrantly up-regulated in GC tissues and GC cell lines compared with corresponding control. In cell lines, MGC‑803 expressed highest level of miR-575 among the tested cells. The level of miR-575 was correlated with the tumor size, AJCC stage and prognosis, but not with the other clinical parameters. Knockdown of miR-575 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptotic death of MGC-803 cells both in vitro and vivo. PTEN levels (both mRNA and protein) were remarkably decreased in cancer tissues compared with the paired-adjacent tissues, and negatively correlated with miR-575 in the tissues. By using luciferase reporter assay, we found PTEN was a direct downstream target of miR-575, and negatively regulated by miR-575 via targeting its 3′UTR. Knockdown or overexpression of miR-575 in MGC-803 cells negatively regulated PTEN expression. Finally, silencing PTEN partially impaired anti-proliferative effects of miR-575 inhibitor. miRNA-575 serves a pivotal role in GC as a cancer promoter gene by targeting PTEN to regulate proliferation and apoptosis of the cancer cells. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). A typical finding on spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of NMOSD is longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). However, patients with NMOSD presenting with short-segment transverse myelitis (STM) during myelitis attacks associated with breast cancer are uncommon. We report a case of a 35-year-old woman with STM and left eye optic neuritis. The patient was positive for serum aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG), and a biopsy of the left breast showed invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with NMOSD and breast malignancy. This is the first report of a patient with NMOSD whose spinal MRI showed STM and serum test showed that the patient's AQP4-IgG was positive and complicated by breast cancer. This case improves our understanding of the association between NMOSD and cancer and raises the question of whether it was a coincidental occurrence. It is important to search for extensive malignancies in patients presenting with atypical MRI or no reaction to traditional therapies. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "We report an extraordinary case of a woman, exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero, who developed clear cell adenocarcinoma of the cervix with a concurrent polymerase-Ɛ (POLE) somatic mutation. The tumor exhibited the classic phenotypic characteristics of POLE-mutated tumors originating from other organs (e.g. the uterus or the colon) including increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and high PD-L1 expression and has remained in remission since completion of primary therapy for >4 years. This case highlights the importance of next generation sequencing in unraveling the biology of rare tumors and supports that the presence of a POLE mutation and the associated ultramutated state confers a unique phenotype of higher immunogenicity and possibly improved prognosis in a tissue-agnostic manner, i.e. regardless of the type of cancer where the POLE mutation is present. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNA small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 pseudogene 3 (SUMO1P3) is located on chromosome 1q23.2, and has been suggested to serve as oncogenic lncRNA in many kinds of human malignancy. The role of SUMO1P3 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was still unknown. In our study, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and observed SUMO1P3 expression was increased in both lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Then, we confirmed that SUMO1P3 expression was significantly increased in NSCLC cancer tissues and cell lines. Meanwhile, the expression levels of SUMO1P3 expression in metastatic lymph node specimens were strikingly elevated in comparison to primary NSCLC tissue specimens. Then, we found high SUMO1P3 expression was correlated with late clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and poor differentiated degree. In the survival analysis of TCGA, we observed that SUMO1P3 expression had no association with overall survival and disease free survival in NSCLC patients. There was a statistically negative correlation between SUMO1P3 expression and miR-136 expression in NSCLC tissues. Moreover, miR-136 directly bound to SUMO1P3, and SUMO1P3 negatively regulated miR-136 expression in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, SUMO1P3 promoted NSCLC cell migration and invasion via regulating miR-136. In conclusion, SUMO1P3 functions as metastasis-associated lncRNA in NSCLC. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer in men. Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3β, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, self-assembled nanoparticles based on amphiphilic xylan-stearic acid (Xyl-SA) conjugates have been developed for the efficient delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in cancer therapy. The self-assembled behavior of Xyl-SA conjugates in aqueous medium was investigated using pyrene as fluorescent probe. To enhance the loading efficacy of 5-FU, the lipophilic 5-fluorouracil-stearic acid (5-FUSA) prodrug was synthesized and subsequently encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of Xyl-SA NPs. The obtained Xyl-SA/5-FUSA NPs had an appropriate size (~278 nm), high drug loading of 5-FUSA (~14.6 wt%) and high physiological stability. The interaction of the Xyl-SA/5-FUSA NPs with blood components was investigated by hemolysis study. The cell cytotoxic studies demonstrated that Xyl-SA/5-FUSA NPs induced higher cytotoxicity than free drugs against the Human colorectal cancer cells (HT-29, HCT-15). These results indicate that Xyl-SA/5-FUSA NPs can serve as a promising drug delivery system for the efficient delivery of 5-FU in cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Type I interferon (IFN) signaling in neoplastic cells has a chemo-sensitizing effect in cancer therapy. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation promotes IFN-β production, which induces apoptosis and impairs proliferation in some cancer cells. Herein, we tested whether the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) can improve chemotherapeutic efficacy in paclitaxel (PTX) resistant cell lines. Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, SW620, HCT-8 (sensitive to PTX), and HCT-8/PTX (resistant to PTX) were treated with poly I:C and the cell viability was measured. Results showed that poly I:C specifically impaired the cell viability of HCT-8/PTX by simultaneously promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, when TLR3 was overexpressed in HCT-8/PTX cells, we found that TLR3 contributed to the production of IFN-β that reduced cell viability, and poly I:C preferentially activated the TLR3-UNC93B1 signaling pathway to mediate this effect. Moreover, cotreatment of poly I:C and PTX acted synergistically to induce cell apoptosis of HCT-8/PTX via upregulating the expression of TLR3 and its molecular chaperone UNC93B1, assisting in the secretion of IFN-β. Notably, a combination of poly I:C and PTX synergistically inhibited the PTX-resistant tumor growth in vivo without side effects. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that poly I:C reinforces the potency of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics in PTX-resistant cell line through the TLR3-UNC93B1-IFN-β signaling pathway, which supplies a novel mechanism of poly I:C for the chemotherapy sensitizing effect in a PTX-resistant tumor. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Oncogenic pituitary homeobox 2 (PITX2), a de facto master regulator of developmental organ asymmetry, previously upregulated multidrug resistance (MDR) P-glycoprotein ABCB1 in A498 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. The role of PITX2 isoforms in MDR cancers was investigated. Data mining correlated elevated PITX2 in >30% of cancers analyzed, maximally in colon (4.4-fold), confirmed in co-immunostaining of colon and renal cancer microarrays wherein ABCB1 concomitantly increased in RCC. Drug-resistant colorectal adenocarcinoma Colo320DM cells exhibited increased nuclear PITX2 (40-fold), PITX2 promoter activity (27-fold) and ABCB1 (8000-fold) compared to drug-sensitive Colo205. ABCB1 inhibitor PSC833/valspodar or PITX2 siRNA reversed doxorubicin resistance. Nuclei from Colo320DM and A498 cells harbored PITX2A/B1 and PITX2A/B1/B2/Cα/Cβ, respectively. ChIP-qPCR evidenced PITX2 promoter binding in drug exporters ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCG2 and importer hOCT3/SLC22A3. In A498, 786-O, Caki-1, Colo320DM, and Caco2 cells, PITX2 siRNA diminished exporters, increased hOCT3/SLC22A3 expression and activity, and reverted vincristine resistance. Heterologous PITX2 expression induced ABCB1, repressed hOCT3/SLC22A3, enhanced vincristine resistance and diminished proliferation inhibition wherein PITX2A and PITX2C were most effective. Furthermore, PITX2 activity and MDR depended on phosphorylation by GSK3 in A498 cells. Conclusively, oncogenic PITX2 limits sensitizing drug uptake and potentiates cytoprotective drug efflux, contributing to MDR phenotype. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Angiogenesis is critical for breast cancer progression. Overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors occur in 25–30% of breast cancers, and treatment with trastuzumab inhibits HER-2-overexpressing tumor growth. Notably, HER-2-mediated signaling enhances vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion to increase tumor-associated angiogenesis. Squalamine (aminosterol compound) suppresses VEGF-induced activation of kinases in vascular endothelial cells and inhibits tumor-associated angiogenesis. We assessed antitumor effects of squalamine either alone or with trastuzumab in nude mice bearing breast tumor xenografts without (MCF-7) or with HER2-overexpression (MCF-7/HER-2). Squalamine alone inhibited progression of MCF-7 tumors lacking HER2 overexpression, and squalamine combined with trastuzumab elicited marked inhibition of MCF-7/HER2 growth exceeding that of trastuzumab alone. MCF-7/HER-2 cells secrete higher levels of VEGF than MCF-7 cells, but squalamine elicited no growth inhibition of either MCF-7/HER-2 or MCF-7 cells in vitro. However, squalamine did stop growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and reduced VEGF-induced endothelial tube-like formations in vitro. These effects correlated with blockade of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and stress fiber assembly in HUVECs. Thus, squalamine effectively inhibits growth of breast cancers with or without HER-2-overexpression, an effect due in part to blockade of tumor-associated angiogenesis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been associated with mortality in several disease sites. We hypothesized that NLR is associated with inferior outcomes in localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Methods: We evaluated the association of pre-treatment NLR, obtained within 6 months of starting SBRT, with overall survival, as well as primary tumor, regional, and distant recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression was then used to assess pre-treatment NLR as a predictor of mortality. We validated our findings in an independent cohort of patients treated at two other institutions. In a secondary analysis, we also evaluated the association of post-treatment NLR with mortality in the training cohort. Results: A total of 156 patients and 166 tumors were included in the training cohort with a median follow-up of 13.4 months. After dichotomization by median, NLR > 3.6 was associated with mortality on univariate (p = 0.010) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.023). In the validation cohort, NLR > 3.6 was similarly associated with mortality on univariate (p = 0.031) and multivariate (p = 0.007) analysis. In a secondary analysis in the training cohort, we found post-treatment NLR was significantly increased compared to pre-treatment NLR (p < 0.001) and associated with mortality on univariate analysis (p = 0.005) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.010). Conclusions: Pre-treatment NLR > 3.6 is associated with mortality in patients treated with SBRT. This finding was validated in an independent cohort of patients treated at two other institutions. Additionally, post-treatment NLR was significantly increased from pre-treatment and associated with overall survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the recent past, various groups have proposed diverse biocompatible methods for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs). Besides culture biomass, culture supernatants (CS) are increasingly being explored for the synthesis of NPs; however, with the ever-increasing exploration of various CS in the biofabrication of NPs, it is equally important to explore the potential of various culture media (CMs) in the synthesis of metal NPs. Considering these aspects, in the present investigation, we explore the possible applicability of various CMs in the biofabrication of metal NPs. The synthesis of NPs was primarily followed by UV/VIS spectroscopy, and, thereafter, the NPs were characterized by various physiochemical techniques, including EM, EDX, FT_IR, X-ray diffraction, and DLS measurements, and finally, their anticancer potentialities were investigated against breast cancer. In addition, the NPs were examined in conjunction with artemisinin for therapeutic benefits against aggressive and highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Cumulatively, the results of the present study collated the potentials of various bacterial CMs in the biofabrication of metal NPs and ascertained the efficacy of the as-synthesized silver nanoparticles, especially the combinatorial entity as intriguing breast cancer therapeutics. The data of the present study plausibly assist in advancing the therapeutic applicability of the combinatorial amalgam against aggressive and highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a lethal disease, and among its variety of etiological factors, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the strongest risk factor. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying H. pylori-related GC need further elucidation. We investigated the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network differences between H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (−) GC. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data from 32 adjacent noncancerous samples and 18 H. pylori (+) and 141 H. pylori (−) stomach adenocarcinoma samples were downloaded from the TCGA database. After construction of lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA ceRNA networks of H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (−) GC, Panther and Kobas databases were used to analyze the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Finally, survival analysis was used to discover the key genes. In H. pylori (+) GC, we identified a total of 1,419 lncRNAs, 82 miRNAs, and 2,501 mRNAs with differentially expressed profiles. In H. pylori (−) GC, 2,225 lncRNAs, 130 miRNAs, and 3,146 mRNAs were differentially expressed. Furthermore, three unique pathways (cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway) were enriched in H. pylori (+) GC. According to the overall survival analysis, three lncRNAs (AP002478.1, LINC00111, and LINC00313) and two mRNAs (MYB and COL1A1) functioned as prognostic biomarkers for patients with H. pylori (+) GC. In conclusion, our study has identified the differences in ceRNA regulatory networks between H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (−) GC and provides a rich candidate reservoir for future studies. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Increasing evidences suggested that cisplatin can be involved in a tumor-specific immune response as an immunomodulator to improve antitumor immunity, but the designation and development are limited. Here, we report a series of novel Pt(IV) complexes derived from the conjugation of platinum(II) anticancer agents with an immune checkpoint TDO inhibitor. These complexes not only showed significant cytotoxic effects on the tested cancer cell lines, but also could enhance antitumor immune response. Particularly, complex T2, the mono-conjuagte of oxoplatin and (E)-4-oxo-4-(3-(2-(pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-1H-indol-1-yl)butanoic acid, displayed 35-fold more potency than cisplatin against TDO-overexpressed HepG-2 cancer cells. Further study indicated that T2 could inhibit TDO via releasing a derivative of a TDO inhibitor and block kynurenine production, resulting in T-cell activation and proliferation in vitro. In vivo tests proved that T2 as a potent immunomodulator could highly promote the antitumor activity of cisplatin and effectively suppress the expression of TDO. This immunochemotherapeutic strategy can be promisingly applied to treat with TDO-overexpressed cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Wnt signaling is overactivated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and several other cancers, and its suppression emerges as an effective anticancer treatment. However, no drugs targeting the Wnt pathway exist on the market nor in advanced clinical trials. Here we provide a comprehensive body of preclinical evidence that an anti-leprotic drug clofazimine is effective against TNBC. Clofazimine specifically inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in a panel of TNBC cells in vitro. In several mouse xenograft models of TNBC, clofazimine efficiently suppresses tumor growth, correlating with in vivo inhibition of the Wnt pathway in the tumors. Clofazimine is well compatible with doxorubicin, exerting additive effects on tumor growth suppression, producing no adverse effects. Its excellent and well-characterized pharmacokinetics profile, lack of serious adverse effects at moderate (yet therapeutically effective) doses, its combinability with cytotoxic therapeutics, and the novel mechanistic mode of action make clofazimine a prime candidate for the repositioning clinical trials. Our work may bring forward the anti-Wnt targeted therapy, desperately needed for thousands of patients currently lacking targeted treatments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Studies on the mechanism of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression are lacking. In this study, TOX3 was identified as a novel cancer suppressor gene in ccRCC. Hypermethylation of CpG probes in the promoter region was associated with the functional loss of TOX3 in ccRCC cancer tissues. Downregulation of TOX3 mRNA was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes in ccRCC. Immunohistochemistry confirmed TOX3 was downregulated in primary tumors without metastasis (n = 126) and further downregulated in primary metastatic tumors (n = 23) compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (n = 92). In vitro, overexpression of TOX3 inhibited RCC cell growth, migration and invasion. Mechanistic investigations showed that TOX3 deficiency facilitates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition due to impairment of transcriptional repression of SNAIL members SNAI1 and SNAI2 and promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. In vivo, restoring TOX3 expression reduced lung metastatic lesions and prolonged survival of mice. TOX3 combined with SNAI1 or SNAI2 predicted overall survival in ccRCC patients. Blockage of this pathway could be a promising therapeutic target for advanced ccRCC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The folic acid-functionalized fluorescent carbon dots (FA-CDs) were synthesized via the assembly of FA to the surface of CDs. A facile hydrothermal method with proline and ethylenediamine as precursors was used to fabricate CDs. The as-prepared CDs possessed active amino groups where the CDs could be further engineered for the conjugation with FA. The uptake of the as-synthesized FA-CDs by FR positive MCF-7 cells (FR++) and HepG-2 cells (FR+) via receptor-mediated endocytosis was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy, which is further verified by a comparative study with FR-negative PC-12 cells (FR-). The bright fluorescence could be observed in FR positive MCF-7 cells while negligible fluorescence was observed in PC-12 cells with low-expressed FR, demonstrating that FA-CDs could accurately identify FR-positive cancer cells from normal cells. The FA-CDs shared favorable biocompatibility, excellent optical properties and ultra-low toxicity etc. Holding these superior properties, the FA-CDs was implemented as a highly effective platform for biological labeling and imaging, which may provide an innovative vision for cancer diagnosis and succeeding personalized therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Mechanisms and events related to common fragile site (CFS) instability are well known in cancer cells. Here, we argue that normal cells remain an important experimental model to address questions related to CFS instability in the absence of alterations in cell cycle and DNA damage repair pathways, which are common features acquired in cancer. Furthermore, a major gap of knowledge concerns the stability of CFSs during gametogenesis. CFS instability in meiotic or postmeiotic stages of the germ cell line could generate chromosome deletions or large rearrangements. This in turn can lead to the functional loss of the several CFS-associated genes with tumor suppressor function. Our hypothesis is that such mutations can potentially result in genetic predisposition to develop cancer. Indirect evidence for CFS instability in human germ cells has been provided by genomic investigations in family pedigrees associated with genetic disease. The issue of CFS instability in the germ cell line should represent one of the future efforts, and may take advantage of the existence of sequence and functional conservation of CFSs between rodents and humans. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women across the globe. The major reason for its recurrence and high mortality is due to the presence of a drug refractory and self-renewing population of cells, the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as a promising cell-based therapeutic agent for the treatment of different cancer types. However, the anti-tumor effect of MSCs has been indicated to be substantially reduced by their in vivo tumor-trophic migration property and direct cell-to-cell integration with tumor stromal elements. To address this drawback, the present study uses a biomaterial, sodium alginate, for the encapsulation of MSCs from the perinatal tissue, Wharton's jelly (WJMSCs) into microbeads, to study the effect of WJMSCs beads on breast CSCs derived from two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7. Encapsulation with sodium alginate facilitated the prevention of direct cell-to-cell interaction and these microbeads provided a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for the encapsulated WJMSCs (eWJMSCs). Compared to two dimensional (2D) culture, eWJMSC increased proliferation of WJMSCs with an increase in pluripotency genes, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune-modulation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the tumor invasion suppressor protein E-cadherin was highly expressed in eWJMSCs as shown by Western blot analysis. In addition, eWJMSCs had an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines VEGF, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10 and -6, and IL-3β when compared to 2D culture. Treatment of CSCs with eWJMSCs reduced cell viability, inhibited migration, and exerted an anti-angiogenic effect. eWJMSCs treatment of CSCs increased caspase 3/7 activity, nitric oxide production, and reactive oxygen species production, suggesting its anti-tumorigenic activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that CSCs treated with eWJMSCs had a downregulation of pro-proliferation markers, drug transporters, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated markers, and angiogenesis related genes. The mode of anti-proliferative action of WJMSCs beads was possibly through inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as indicated by the upregulation of the Wnt antagonists sFRP4 and DKK1. These data suggest that alginate-encapsulated WJMSCs could be an efficient cell contact-free system for developing stem cell-based therapies for CSCs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "A series of novel analogs of Allicin (S-allyl prop-2-ene-1-sulfinothioate) present in garlic has been synthesized in high yield. Synthesized 23 compounds were evaluated against different breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7) and non-cancer cells (WI38). Four compounds (3f, 3h, 3m and 3u) showed significant cytotoxicity against cancer cells whereas nontoxic to the normal cells. Based on the LD 50 values and selectivity index (SI), compound 3h (S-p-methoxybenzyl (p-methoxyphenyl)methanesulfinothioate) was considered as most promising anticancer agent amongst the above three compounds. Further bio-chemical studies confirmed that compound 3h promotes ROS generation, changes in mitochondrial permeability transition and induced caspase mediated DNA damage and apoptosis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) affects many mechanisms that have been shown to play roles in carcinogenesis. Recently, we found that, in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells, PGE 2 acts through an intracrine mechanism by which its uptake by the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) results in increased intracellular PGE 2 (iPGE 2 ), leading to enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and loss of cell adhesion to collagen I. These iPGE 2 -mediated effects were dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), whose expression increased upon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation by a subset of intracellular PGE 2 receptors. Here, we aimed to study the role of COX in PGE 2 protumoral effects in PC3 cells and found that the effects were prevented by inhibition of COX-2, which highlights its crucial role amplifying the levels of iPGE 2 . Treatment with exogenous PGE 2 determined a transcriptional increase in COX-2 expression, which was abolished by genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PGT. PGE 2 -induced increase in COX-2 expression and, thereby, in transcriptional increase in HIF-1α expression was due to EGFR activation, leading to the activation of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, Extracellular signal -regulated kinases 1/2, p38 and Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2, p38 and MSK-1). Collectively, the data suggest that EGFR-dependent COX-2 upregulation by a novel positive feedback loop triggered by iPGE 2 underlies the intracrine pro-tumoral effects of PGE 2 in PC3 cells. Therefore, this feedback loop may be relevant in prostate cancer for the maintenance of PGE 2 -dependent cancer cell growth through amplifying the activity of the COX-2 pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Urothelial bladder carcinoma is the ninth most common cancer in the world, with an estimated 150,000 deaths per year. Two comprehensive analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas urothelial bladder carcinoma reported that chromatin modifier gene mutations were common in bladder cancer. We aimed to find how the mutations and transcriptional profiles of the genes involving in chromatin modification affected the prognosis of patients. The data were retrieved from the Genomic Data Commons data portal and the gene list in pathway Chromatin Modifying Enzymes were obtained from Reactome. The expression levels and mutational profiles of the genes involving in the chromatin were utilized altogether to construct a fusion patient similarity network by similarity network fusion. The genes that were differentially expressed in one clustered group or two were identified. Fifty chromatin-regulating genes had nonsilent mutations in at least 10 patients. KMT2D, KDM6A, CREBBP, ARID1A, and ARID2 had enriched inactivating mutations. Among 399 cases where both the single-nucleotide polymorphism information and the messenger RNA expression profiles were available, 326, 23, and 50 patients were clustered into Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The survival analysis suggested that the patients in these three groups had a different prognosis. Thity-one genes were identified as differentially expressed in any group. The Gene Ontology term enrichment showed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in the immune response especially in the complement activation.

    "Abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has been reported to be useful for the assessment of lung cancer staging. It is uncertain whether DWI is more accurate for the response evaluation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy compared to computed tomography (CT). The purpose of this study is to compare the response evaluation of DWI for chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to recurrent tumors of lung cancer with that of CT which is a standard tool in RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours). Forty-one patients who agreed to this project and had CT scan and DWI examinations within a month of each other every six months for at least 2 years after pulmonary resection of primary lung cancer were enrolled in this study. Of the patients, 24 patients had metastases or recurrences, and CT and DWI were performed for assessment of the response evaluation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to recurrent lesions. They were followed up for at least two years after the relapse. The response evaluation by CT using RECIST were PR in five patients, SD in two, and PD in the remaining 17 patients. On the other hand, the response evaluation by DWI were CR in four patients, PR in two patients, SD in one, and PD in the remaining 17 patients. Follow-up studies revealed the response evaluation by DWI were correct. Functional evaluation of DWI is better than that of CT for the response evaluation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to recurrent tumors of lung cancer. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Increased urinary acetylated polyamines (APs) are reported as cancer biomarkers in many studies. N 1 ,N 12 -diacetylspermine has been proposed as a biomarker indicative of different cancers in urine and plasma. N 1 -Acetylspermine has previously been found to be increased in the saliva of patients with breast cancer; however, in plasma this metabolite was too low abundant to be detected by previous analytical methods. In addition, no method has been reported to perform AP analysis on the level of speed, robustness and sensitivity required for daily clinical routines. Here we describe a high-throughput sample preparation and LC-MS/MS method for the fast, accurate and precise quantification of three APs: N 8 -acetylspermidine, N 1 -acetylspermine, and N 1 ,N 12 -diacetylspermine in plasma, urine and saliva. Stable isotope labeled N 1 ,N 12 -diacetylspermine was used as internal standard. Robustness was validated by intra- and inter-day reproducibility. Precision and accuracy of the method were tested at six concentration levels from 0.0375 to 750 ng/mL resulting in less than 15% relative standard deviation and less than 15% percent error in quantification. Using 96-well plates, the assay described herein allows for preparing, analyzing, and quantifying 240 samples per day for a single researcher to quantify three APs commonly related to cancer status. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Mortality-to-incidence ratios in patients with cancer are extremely high, positioning cancer as a major cause of death worldwide. Ether-à-go-go-1 (Eag1) is an ion channel that plays important roles in tumour proliferation, malignant transformation, invasion, metastasis, recurrence, and prognosis. Therefore, identifying potent and specific Eag1 channel inhibitors is crucial. In this study, we identified the first natural inhibitor of Eag1, the traditional Chinese medicine agent tetrandrine, and explored the underlying mechanism. Tetrandrine directly interacted with Eag1 and inhibited the currents in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 of 69.97 ± 5.2 μM), and the amino acids Ile 550 , Thr 552 , and Gln 557 in the Eag1 C-linker domain were critical for tetrandrine’s inhibitory effect. Moreover, tetrandrine reduced the proliferation of HeLa cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing Eag1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, tetrandrine (30 mg/kg/day) inhibited tumor growth in mice, demonstrating a 64.21% inhibitory rate of HeLa cell-transplanted tumors. These results suggest that tetrandrine is a potent and selective Eag1 channel inhibitor, and could act as a leading compound in the development of therapies for Eag1 ion channel dysfunction-induced diseases. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previous studies have described the association of spinal epidural lipomatosis with several conditions including chronic steroid therapy, Cushing's syndrome, obesity, Paget disease, and hypothyroidism. We present a report of rapid development of spinal epidural lipomatosis after treatment with second-generation anti-androgen therapy, a new strategy for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that has been increasingly employed in the past few years. A comprehensive discussion of the underlying molecular networks involving androgen receptor blockage and adipocyte differentiation, as well as the clinical implications of such a phenomenon, are provided. Case Description: We describe the clinical and radiological evolution of a 58-year-old male patient with metastatic prostate cancer, who developed new onset of rapidly progressing lumbosacral epidural lipomatosis with significant compression of the nerve roots of the cauda equina a few months after initiation of treatment with second-generation androgen receptor antagonists. Conclusions: The underlying pathophysiology of adipose tissue growth following the administration of anti-androgen therapy is discussed, with emphasis on both the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as in the Wnt-independent pathway involving direct activation of downstream transcription factors from the T-cell factor family by the androgen receptor. As second-generation androgen receptor antagonists have been increasingly used for treatment of castration-resistant stage metastatic prostate cancer, new onset of symptomatic epidural lipomatosis should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis, especially because the urinary symptoms of cauda equina compression may be improperly attributed to the primary prostate neoplasm. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To determine the number and characteristics of cancers detected and the optimal imaging evaluation in women presenting with focal breast pain (FBP). Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective review of 4720 women who underwent imaging for FBP from 2001 to 2013. Women 18 and over with one or two foci of breast pain and no concurrent breast symptoms were included. 944 patients met criteria. We recorded the imaging work-up, presence and type of finding at the site of pain, BI-RADS® assessment, and pathological outcomes. Subsequent imaging and clinical follow up was recorded. Results: Imaging evaluation consisted of sonogram alone in 286 women, mammogram alone in 231 women, and both in 427 women. 113 women had an imaging finding at the site of pain; 103 were designated benign or probably benign. 12 biopsies of corresponding findings were performed: 9 benign, 1 invasive lobular carcinoma, 1 invasive ductal carcinoma, 1 ductal carcinoma in situ. All three malignancies were seen mammographically; 2 had an ultrasound correlate. At initial evaluation, 4 incidental breast cancers were diagnosed remote from the site of FBP. All were seen on mammogram and 2 of 4 had an ultrasound correlate. On follow up evaluation, 9 cancers were diagnosed at the site of pain and 13 incidental cancers were diagnosed. Conclusion: FBP is rarely associated with malignancy. Targeted ultrasound may be deferred in women 40 and older with FBP, no other clinical findings, and a negative mammogram. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Metastasis is the main cause of death in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Aberrant fucosylation, catalyzed by the specific fucosyltransferases (FUTs), is associated with malignant behaviors. Non-conding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), emerge as key molecules in cancer malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis modified fucosylation on sLe X -CD44 (HCELL), which served as E-selectin ligand during CRC progression. Higher levels of HOTAIR and FUT6 were verified in CRC tissues and cell lines, with a positive correlation. HOTAIR was associated with poor clinical prognosis of CRC. Altered HOTAIR levels influenced proliferation, aggressiveness, apoptosis and tumorigenesis of CRC cells. HOTAIR directly harbored miR-326 binding sites and regulated FUT6 expression. Further results corroborated that HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis modified α1, 3-fucosylation of CD44, which mediated CRC malignancy. Co-modulation of HOTAIR, miR-326 and FUT6 impacted α1, 3-fucosylated CD44, which further triggered PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. HOTAIR also mediated CRC tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings indicated that HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis mediated CRC procession through α1, 3-fucosylated CD44 via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This work rendered new therapeutic targets for CRC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: To determine the predictive value of preoperative lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) for pathological and survival outcomes in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). Methods: This retrospective study included 704 UTUC patients between 2008 and 2017. We used a cutoff LMR of 3.6 to evaluate its relationship with oncological outcomes after RNU, using the Kaplan–Meier method and logistic regression models. Results: During median follow-up of 39 months, decreased preoperative LMR was an independent predictor of poor pathological outcomes. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that patients with low LMR (<3.6) had poor cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS); this prognostic value was ascertained for patients with high pathological grade and more advanced stage UTUC, but not for patients with low pathological features. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed that low LMR was an independent predictor of poor CSS, RFS and OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.42, P = 0.02; HR = 1.39, P = 0.008; HR = 1.38, P = 0.017, respectively]. Conclusion: Preoperative low LMR was an independent predictor of poor pathological and oncological outcomes of UTUC after RNU. Subgroup analysis confirmed that the prognostic value of LMR was confined to patients with a high pathological grade and more advanced stage tumor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, feruloylated bagasse xylan (FBX) was synthesized with a method based on homogeneous catalytic esterification of bagasse xylan (BX) with ferulic acid (FA) in the presence of triethylamine as a catalyst, and it was further grafted with methacrylic acid (MAA) and butyl acrylate (BA) to synthesize FBX-g-MAA/BA grafted copolymer by using ammonium persulfate as initiator and N,N-methylene acrylamide as cross-linker. The effects of reaction variables including reaction time, temperature and reactant concentration on the esterification and graft reactions were investigated carefully by conducting orthogonal tests. A maximum degree of substitution (DS) of 1.76 for the esterification and a maximum graft ratio (GR) of 31% can be achieved by performing the reaction at optimized reaction parameters. The molecular docking was further performed to study the binding mode of the final product into the active site of human Caprin-2 C1q domain (4OUM, cause gastric cancer protein), liver cancer protein (1UV0) and lung cancer protein (3B9S). The software generated results were in satisfactory agreement with the evaluated biological activity. The anticancer performances of BX, FBX and FBX-g-MAA/BA copolymer were investigated by using a 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) method. The results indicated that the inhibition ratio of FBX-g-MAA/BA copolymer on BEL-7407 (liver cancer cells) can reach 25.28% ± 4.01%, which is two times higher than that of BX. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is to repress the expression of various genes by eliminating acetyl group from histone. Thus, the regulation of HDAC3 activity is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis. In this study, we found that HDAC3 interacts with c-Src kinase. However, the interaction between HDAC3 and c-Src was previously reported, it has still been ambiguous whether c-Src phosphorylates HDAC3 and affects the function of HDAC3. First, we confirmed that HDAC3 directly binds to c-Src, and c-Src identified to interact with C-terminal domain (277–428 a.a.) of HDAC3. c-Src also phosphorylated three tyrosine sites of HDAC3 at tyrosine 325, 328, and 331. Importantly, wild-type c-Src increases HDAC3 activity, but not mutant c-Src K298M (kinase inactive form). When these tyrosine residues are all substituted for alanine residues, the deacetylase activity of mutant HDAC3 was abolished. In addition, a proliferation of HER2-positive breast cancer cells expressing phosphorylation deficient mutant HDAC3 is decreased in comparison with control cells. Thus, our findings suggested that phosphorylation of HDAC3 by c-Src kinase regulates the HDAC3 activity and the proliferation of breast cancer cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Currently, research on genome-scale epigenetic modifications for studying the pathogenesis of lung cancer is lacking. Aberrant DNA methylation, as the most common and important modification in epigenetics, is an important means of regulating genomic function and can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In this paper, methylation information and gene expression data from patients with LUSC were extracted from the TCGA database. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses were used to screen abnormally methylated genes related to the prognosis of LUSC. The relationship between key DNA methylation sites and the transcriptional expression of LUSC-related genes was explored. A prognostic risk model constructed by four abnormally methylated genes (VAX1, CH25H, AdCyAP1, and Irx1) was used to predict the prognosis of LUSC patients. Also, the methylation levels of the key gene IRX1 are significantly correlated with the prognosis and correlated with the methylation of the site cg09232937 and cg10530883. This study is based on high-throughput data mining and provides an effective bioinformatics basis for further understanding the pathogenesis and prognosis of LUSC, which has important theoretical significance for follow-up studies on LUSC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Although stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the standard of care for inoperable early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), its role for medically operable patients remains controversial. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a multi-institutional study to assess post-SBRT disease control and survival outcomes in medically operable patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including patients with biopsy-proven cT1-2N0M0 NSCLC treated with definitive SBRT (2006–2015). Per patient charts, inoperability referred to documentation of poor surgical candidacy with a given rationale for lack of resection. Charts of operable patients contained documentation of patients refusing surgery or choosing SBRT, without a documented rationale for inoperability. Subjects were excluded in cases of ambiguity regarding the aforementioned definitions and/or lack of clearly documented operability status. Endpoints included local failure (LF) and regional-distant failure, both evaluated with Fine and Gray competing risks regression; Kaplan-Meier methodology analyzed overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Of 952 patients, 408 (42.9%) were operable, and 544 (57.1%) were inoperable. Median follow-up was 22 months. Two-year LF was 9.7% in operable patients and 8.2% in inoperable patients (p = 0.36). There was no statistical difference in regional-distant failure (p = 0.55) between cohorts. Operable patients experienced statistically higher OS (p = 0.04), but not PFS (p = 0.11). Respective 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS in operable patients were 85.4%, 66.2%, and 51.2%. Conclusions: Although patients with operable NSCLC experience higher OS than their inoperable counterparts, disease-related outcomes are similar. These results may better inform shared decision-making between medically operable patients and their multidisciplinary providers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the outcome of a literature review that an overview of various types of antenna and metamaterial applicator performance towards cancerous tissue or cell for non-invasive hyperthermia cancer treatment (NIHCT) procedure. From the review, it shows that when LHM lens integrated with an antenna, focusing capabilities of the antenna towards the cancerous area can be improved. However, current applicators have a poor focusing effect when directed towards the actual tumor area. In conjunction with that, this paper proposes a new design of modified applicator that is microstrip antenna integrated with left-handed metamaterial (LHM) lens. The antenna termed microstrip-LHM (M-LHM) lens antenna is proposed for use in NIHCT. It is expected to improve the focusing capabilities of an antenna which is used to kill the cancerous area and thus improve the hyperthermia cancer treatment procedure success rate. In addition, this paper provides an overview of heating techniques used in hyperthermia to enhance focusing capabilities and a few metamaterial advantages that can improve the focusing effect and reduced the hot-spots. Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) will be investigated to evaluate the focusing abilities of the proposed applicator using the SEMCAD X Solver. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

    "Abstract": "The KRAS gene is highly mutated in human cancers and the focus of current Ras drug development efforts. Recently the interface between the C-terminus of K-Ras and calmodulin (CaM) was proposed as a target site to block K-Ras driven cancer cell stemness. We therefore aimed at developing a high-throughput amenable screening assay to identify novel CaM-inhibitors as potential K-Ras stemness-signaling disruptors. A modulated time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (mTR-FRET)-assay was developed and benchmarked against an identically designed fluorescence anisotropy (FA)-assay. In both assays, two CaM-binding peptides were labeled with Eu(III)-chelate or fluorescein and used as single-label reporter probes that were displaced from CaM upon competitor binding. Thus, peptidic and small molecule competitors with nanomolar to micromolar affinities to CaM could be detected, including a peptide that was derived from the C-terminus of K-Ras. In order to detect CaM-residue specific covalent inhibitors, a cell lysate-based Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-assay was furthermore established. This assay enabled us to measure the slow, residue-specific, covalent inhibition by ophiobolin A in the presence of other endogenous proteins. In conclusion, we have developed a panel of fluorescence-assays that allows identification of conventional and covalent CaM-inhibitors as potential disruptors of K-Ras driven cancer cell stemness. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Platelet-tumour cell interaction is implicated in the initiation of breast cancer-associated thrombosis, with hormone-therapy (Tamoxifen/Anastrozole), increasing this risk. However, recent in vitro research indicates that Tamoxifen inhibits platelet activation, while the effects of Anastrozole on platelet activation are not well characterised. This study investigated platelet activation caused by Tamoxifen or Anastrozole-treated breast cancer cells in vitro. MCF7 and T47D cells were pre-treated with Tamoxifen or Anastrozole to mimic the effects of the drugs in vivo, and co-cultured with whole blood. Platelet activation was determined using flow cytometry. Platelet (CD41a + CD62P + ) was determined using an interval gating strategy. Platelet morphology was visualised using scanning electron microscopy. Our results support clinical findings, showing that hormone-therapy is associated with platelet activation. Tamoxifen-treated MCF7 cells increased P-selectin expression, with ultrastructural analysis showing fully spread platelets. Conversely, Tamoxifen-treated T47D cells decreased P-selectin expression with platelets showing signs of early aggregation. Anastrozole pre-treatment decreased P-selectin expression, with treated MCF7 cells inducing platelet membrane folds and lamellipodia extension, and treated T47D cells inducing platelet aggregation and fibrin network formation indicating hypercoagulation. The findings support clinical studies. Hormone-therapy augments tumour cell-induced platelet activation, which may be linked to cell phenotype. This may have clinical implications for treatment strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: This study aimed to explore the prevalence of the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) before diagnosis and during oncology therapy, and reveal the disclosure of CAM use among Hungarian breast cancer patients. Materials and methods: In a cross-sectional survey a self-administered questionnaire was used covering patients’ demographics, oncology-related variables and various aspects of CAM use. Data were collected from 135 patients. Data analysis included descriptive analysis and Chi-square tests. Results: The prevalence of CAM use was 52.6% before diagnosis while it was 84.4% during therapy. The most commonly used CAM practices before diagnosis and during therapy were vitamins/minerals (37%, 60%, respectively) and herbs (31.9%, 78.5%, respectively). The frequency of CAM use before diagnosis was higher among more educated patients (p < 0.001) and those living in cities (p = 0.001) while during therapy it was higher among patients with higher income (p = 0.020). Over 40% of the patients informed their physician about each CAM practice they used. Conclusion: Besides conventional medicine, CAM practices are also regarded as an important part of therapy by cancer patients. The higher frequency of CAM use during therapy and the relatively modest disclosure towards physicians indicate a greater need for patients’ education regarding CAM practices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in various tumors by regulating downstream target genes and diverse signaling pathways. Herein, we confirmed miR-1265 expression in gastric cancer (GC) using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and assessed the level of miR-1265 expression in clinical specimens and cell lines. We found that miR-1265 expression was negatively correlated with tumor size. Further functional analysis revealed that miR-1265 suppresses cellular proliferation and autophagy while inducing apoptosis in GC cells. A luciferase reporter assay was used to identify an miR-1265 targeted gene, calcium binding protein 39 (CAB39), which is an essential upstream regulator in the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Upregulation or downregulation of CAB39 expression reversed the effects of miR-1265 overexpression or inhibition, respectively. Notably, the knockdown of autophagy-related gene 12 (ATG12) impaired the effects of miR-1265 inhibition or CAB39 overexpression in GC. MiR-1265 also suppressed the growth of GC cells in vivo and that of human gastric organoids. Altogether, our results show that miR-1265 suppresses GC progression and oncogenic autophagy by reducing CAB39 expression and regulating the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, miR-1265 may represent a potential therapeutic target for GC. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "This work investigates how the luminescent ruthenium-nitrite complexes cis-[Ru(py-bodipy)(dcbpy) 2 (NO 2 )](PF 6 ) (I) and cis-[Ru(py-bodipy)(dcbpy-aminopropyl-β-lactose) 2 (NO 2 )](PF 6 ) (II) behave toward the melanoma cancer cell line B16F10. The chemical structure and purity of the synthesized complexes were analyzed by UV-Visible and FTIR spectroscopy, MALDI, HPLC, and 1 H NMR. Spectrofluorescence helped to determine the fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes of each of these complexes. In vitro MTT cell viability assay on B16F10 cancer cells revealed that the complexes possibly have a tumoricidal role. The metal-nitrite complexes evidenced the dichotomous NO nature: at high concentration, NO exerted a tumoricidal effect, whereas cancer cells grew at low NO concentration. Flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy aided cellular uptake calculation. Cell staining followed by fluorescence microscopy associated with organelle markers such as DAPI and Rhodamine 123 detected preferential intracellular localization of the ruthenium-nitrite py-bodipy and aminopropyl lactose derivative ruthenium complex in mitochondria. Thus, the cytotoxicity of compounds (I) and (II) against B16F10 cancer cell line show concentration-dependent results. The present studies suggest that nitric oxide ruthenium derivative compounds could be new potential chemotherapeutic agents against cytotoxic cells. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Twelve derivatives of artemisinin-piperazine-dithiocarbamate have been synthesised, and some of them showing good in vitro cytotoxic activity. Compound 3g exhibits the best inhibitory activity against SMMC-7721 cell lines with an IC 50 of 0.0025 ± 0.04 μM for 72 h, but the toxicity was lower against LO2 cell lines with an IC 50 of 0.18 ± 0.04 μM for 72 h. The results indicate that compound 3g is more cytotoxic towards cancer cell lines than towards benign cell lines compared with vincristine in vitro. And compound 3g also has good inhibitory activity against colon, breast and prostate cancer cells. Meanwhile, we have also proposed the six-member ring mechanism of DMSO in catalysing the esterification of hydroxyl and acyl chloride. Instead of using the hydroxyl, we can obtain the nucleophilic substitution production simply and efficiently without a Lewis acid, which has not been reported previously. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Background: While incidences of cancer are continuously increasing, drug resistance of malignant cells is observed towards almost all pharmaceuticals. Several isoflavonoids and flavonoids are known for their cytotoxicity towards various cancer cells. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of isoflavones: osajin (1), 5,7-dihydroxy-4ˈ-methoxy-6,8-diprenylisoflavone (2) and biflavonoids: chamaejasmin (3), 7,7″-di-O-methylchamaejasmin (4) and campylospermone A (5), a dimeric chromene [diphysin(6)] and an ester of ferullic acid with long alkyl chain [erythrinasinate (7)] isolated from the stem bark and roots of the Kenyan medicinal plant, Ormocarpum kirkii. The mode of action of compounds 2 and 4 was further investigated. Methods: The cytotoxicity of compounds was determined based on the resazurin reduction assay. Caspases activation was evaluated using the caspase-Glo assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle (propodium iodide (PI) staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H 2 DCFH-DA). CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were used as model cells for mechanistic studies. Results: Compounds 1, 2 and 4 displayed IC 50 values below 20 µM towards CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells, and were further tested towards a panel of 7 carcinoma cells. The IC 50 values of the compounds against carcinoma cells varied from 16.90 µM (in resistant U87MG.ΔEGFR glioblastoma cells) to 48.67 µM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for 1, from 7.85 µM (in U87MG.ΔEGFR cells) to 14.44 µM (in resistant MDA-MB231/BCRP breast adenocarcinoma cells) for 2, from 4.96 µM (towards U87MG.ΔEGFRcells) to 7.76 µM (against MDA-MB231/BCRP cells) for 4, and from 0.07 µM (against MDA-MB231 cells) to 2.15 µM (against HepG2 cells) for doxorubicin. Compounds 2 and 4 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by MMP alteration and increased ROS production. Conclusion: The present report indicates that isoflavones and biflavonoids from Ormocarpum kirkii are cytotoxic compounds with the potential of being exploited in cancer chemotherapy. Compounds 2 and 4 deserve further studies to develop new anticancer drugs to fight sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant tumor worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new class of endogenous non-coding RNAs, are widespread and abundant in mammalian cells. Cumulative evidence showed that circRNAs play significant roles in the process of cancer. However, the expression and function of circRNAs in HCC remain to be investigated. Methods: The expression of circular RNA SMARCA5 (circSMARCA5) in tissues and plasma samples was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The role of circSMARCA5 in HCC progression was assessed by in vitro experiments. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to evaluate the value of circSMARCA5 as a biomarker in HCC. Results: The expression of circSMARCA5 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues. CircSMARCA5 levels were correlated with tumor differentiation (p = 0.023), Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (p = 0.001), cancer invasion (p = 0.004), as well as cancer diameter (p = 0.018). In vitro cell experiments revealed that overexpression of circSMARCA5 resulted in inhibited proliferation, increased apoptosis and suppressed invasion. Moreover, we found that circSMARCA5 expression was down-regulated in plasma samples of patients with HCC. The ROC curve analyses revealed that plasma circSMARCA5 showed a high accuracy (AUC = 0.938, 0.853, 0.711) for diagnosing HCC from healthy controls, hepatitis and cirrhosis. The area under the ROC curve of plasma circSMARCA5 in combination with AFP in diagnosing HCC from hepatitis and cirrhosis was 0.903 and 0.858. Especially, plasma circSMARCA5 presented a high accuracy (AUC = 0.847, 0.706) for detecting HCC with serum AFP below 200 ng/ml from those hepatitis and cirrhosis with AFP below 200 ng/ml. Conclusion: Our study revealed that circSMARCA5 may promote apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. CircSMARCA5 may serve as a potential prediction and monitor biomarker for HCC, especially in HCC patients with AFP blow the cutoff value. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: The use of radiotherapy (RT) for pediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) experiencing disease progression or recurrence (15%) is controversial. We report treatment patterns and outcomes for pediatric patients with refractory/recurrent HL (rrHL) treated with curative-intent RT. Materials and methods: Forty-six patients with rrHL treated with salvage RT at our institution were identified. All received risk-adapted, response-based frontline therapy and were retrieved with cytoreductive regimens followed by RT to failure sites, with or without autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT). Cumulative incidence (CIN) of local failure (LF) and survival were estimated after salvage RT and regression models determined predictors of LF after salvage RT. Results: RT was administered as part of frontline therapy in 70% of patients, omitted for early response assessment in 13%, or deferred for primary progression in 17%. AHCT was omitted in 20% of patients. Median initial and salvage dose/site were 25.5 Gy and 30.6 Gy, respectively. Eight patients experienced progression. Two died without progression (median follow-up from salvage RT = 3.8 years). The 5-year CIN of LF after salvage RT was 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2–30.2%). The 5-year freedom from subsequent treatment failure and overall survival (OS) was 80.1% (95% CI, 69.2–92.6%) and 88.5% (95% CI, 79.5–98.6%), respectively. Inadequate response to salvage systemic therapy (p = 0.048) and male sex (p = 0.049) were significantly associated with LF after salvage RT. Conclusion: rrHL is responsive to salvage RT, with low LF rates after moderate doses. OS is excellent, despite refractory disease. Initial salvage therapy response predicts subsequent LF. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1), a widely reported DNA demethylation protein, has been associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, whether TET1 is an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene has been controversial; the mechanism of how TET1 affects cancer progression remains unclear. The current study aims to investigate how TET1 is changed in the tumor microenvironment and to explore the mechanisms of how TET1 affects colon cancer progression. Because hypoxia prevails on solid tumors, we established an important connection between hypoxia and DNA demethylation in tumorigenesis. By qPCR and RNA interference (RNAi) technology, we found that hypoxia increased TET1 expression with a hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1α)-dependent manner. By CHIP-qPCR and pyrosequencing technology, we demonstrated that TET1 regulated the target gene expression of HIF-1α through HIF-1α binding to hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs), and HIF-1α binding to HREs depended on CpG methylation levels. By Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assay, we showed that loss of TET1 did not affect cell proliferation but inhibited migration. We also identified two novel gene mutants of TET1 in 120 paired tumor/normal tissue specimens by DNA sequencing and found that TET1 E2082K mutant blocked the TET1-enhanced cell migration. Our results showed that the downregulation of TET1 rescued the abnormally high levels of gene expression resulting from hypoxia in tumors and reduced the migration activity of tumor cells, suggesting a therapeutic role by interference with TET1 in colon cancer treatment. By demonstrating that hypoxia upregulated TET1 and that TET1 drove HIF-1α-responsive genes, we showed that an epigenetic mechanism and tumor microenvironment-driven models coexisted and mutually affected colon cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Clinical staging, as used for patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early-stage lung cancer, inadequately accounts for pleural invasion, which is a pathologic criteria. Considering the current situation, we analyzed effects of relationships between tumors and the pleura on treatment outcomes of SBRT for early-stage lung cancer. Materials and methods: Among consecutive patients treated with SBRT between 2006 and 2017, we retrospectively identified non-small cell lung cancer patients with primary tumor diameters ≤4 cm and N0M0. The relationships between tumors and the pleura were investigated. The effects of these findings on treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results: We identified 386 patients which met the inclusion criteria. Among these patients, 323 patients were with tumors of 0.1–3.0 cm (T1-size), and 63 patients were with tumors of 3.1–4.0 cm (T2a-size). Among patients with T1-size tumors, 120, 134, and 23 had findings of pleural contact, pleural indentation, and pleural thickening, respectively. When we divided T1-size patients into 2 groups based on pleural contact (contact− or contact+), the 3-year cause-specific mortality and overall survival in patients with T1-size & contact+ were significantly worse than those in patients with T1-size & contact− (17.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 10.7–25.9%) vs. 6.6% (95% CI, 3.5–11.1%), p < 0.01), and 58.2% (95% CI, 47.6–67.5%) vs. 77.6% (95% CI, 70.5–83.2%), p < 0.01). Local recurrence, regional recurrence, pleural cavity recurrence, and distant metastasis were associated with worse cause-specific mortality and overall survival. On multivariate analysis, pleural contact was associated with cause-specific mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 1.96; 95% CI, 1.09–3.52; p = 0.03) and overall survival (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08–2.34; p = 0.02). Conclusion: Pleural contact in clinical T1N0M0 lung cancer patients was associated with significantly worse survivals. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to derive distant metastases (DM) risk-groups in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients treated with postoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy (PO-IMRT). Methods: OSCC patients treated with PO-IMRT were divided into discovery (2005–2012) and validation (2013–2014) cohorts. DM predictors were identified from multivariable analysis (MVA) to derive low- and high-risk groups in the discovery-cohort. The result was subsequently evaluated in validation-cohort. Results: Overall 447 patients were included (discovery-cohort: n = 300, and validation-cohort: n = 147). Between the two cohorts, there were no significant differences in DM (p = 0.16) or OS (p = 0.26). MVA identified pN2-3 and histological grade 2–3 (G2-3) as DM predictors. High-risk group included patients who had both poor predictors (pN2-3 and G2-3), while low-risk group included patients with no or only one poor predictor. In discovery-cohort, 3-year distant control (DC) was 78% and 97% in high- and low-risk groups respectively (p < 0.001, concordance index = 0.72). In validation-cohort, risk-group classification performed similarly (concordance index = 0.73). The 3-year OS for high- versus low-risk group was 85% versus 95% in discovery-cohort (p < 0.001), and 74% versus 93% in validation-cohort (p < 0.001). Conclusion: A model (G2-3/pN2-3) which identifies high DM risk was validated internally. This model might be used to design future prospective studies investigating treatment intensification and/or DM surveillance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) has been implicated in the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC), and autophagy contributes to tumorigenesis and cancer cell survival. However, the regulatory role of UCA1 in CRC cell viability by modulating autophagy remains unclear. In the present study, a significant positive correlation was observed between UCA1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) levels, and the elevated UCA1 was negatively correlated with the PKB/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in 293T cells. Downregulation of UCA1 inhibited autophagy activation and cell proliferation, whereas the apoptosis was increased and the cell cycle was arrested in G2 stage. The next results showed that UCA1 was markedly upregulated in Caco-2 cells. Knockdown of UCA1 significantly decreased the LC3-II and autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) protein levels and resulted in an increase in p62 expression. Conversely, the autophagy activator rapamycin (RAPA) reversed the effects. Furthermore, downregulated UCA1 decreased Caco-2 cells population in the G1 phase and increased the cells number in G2 phage. The cell proliferation was inhibited, and apoptosis rate was promoted. More important, RAPA could also abrogate the changes induced by knockdown of UCA1. Collectively, these data demonstrated that downregulated UCA1 induced autophagy inhibition, resulting in suppressing cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis, which suggested that UCA1 might serve as a potential new oncogene to regulate CRC cells viability by modulating autophagy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "1,7-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-heptadien-3-one (EB30) is a diarylheptanoid-like compound isolated from Viscum coloratum. This curcumin analog exhibits significant cytotoxic activity against HeLa, SGC-7901, and MCF-7 cells. However, little is known about the anticancer effects and mechanisms of EB30 in human lung cancer. The current study reports that EB30 significantly reduced the cell viability of A549 and NCI-H292 human lung cancer cells. Further examination revealed that EB30 not only induced cell cycle arrest and promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also induced cell apoptosis through the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways. Furthermore, EB30 upregulated the expression levels of p-ERK1/2 and p-P90RSK, whereas downregulating the phosphorylation of Akt and P70RSK. Cell viability was further inhibited by the combination of EB30 with LY294002 (a specific PI3K inhibitor) or U0126 (a MEK inhibitor). The current study indicates that EB30 is a potential anticancer agent that induces cell apoptosis via suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway and activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The current research is focused to develop and investigate the toxicity and penetration potential of biocompatible chitosan nanogel encapsulating capecitabine by ionic interaction mechanism exhibiting pH triggered transdermal targeting. The nanogel (CPNL) was synthesized by ion gelation mechanism using Pluronic F 127 and surface decoration by Transcutol as non-ionic penetration enhancer. The CPNL possesses fine morphology and nano size range when evaluated by TEM, SEM and DLS analysis with cationic charge and slightly acidic pH assayed by zeta potential and pH analysis. It showed pH responsive drug release characteristics mimicking the skin cancer micro-environment. The MTT assay and apoptotic index of CPNL on HaCaT cell line elaborated optimal cell toxicity and retention on 24 h of exposure. The ex-vivo skin penetration analysis exhibited noteworthy diffusion and penetration caliber through concentration depth profile, steady state flux and fluorescent skin imaging on porcine tissue. Overall outcomes suggested CPNL as a potent alternative biocompatible, transdermal nanotherapy against skin cancer displaying significant penetration caliber with enhance toxicity on cancerous cell. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE)-MRI has high diagnostic performance of prostate cancer. However, it is preferable to avoid the use of MRI contrast media. A study reported that the diagnosability of the wash-in index of DCE-MRI was equivalent to the intravoxel incoherent motion of the diffusion weighted image. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between the slow component apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the wash-out index of the DCE. Materials and methods: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with prostate cancer by biopsy were enrolled in this study. The fast and slow component ADCs of the DWI were calculated for 76 points of the tumor and the contralateral normal parts. Furthermore, the wash-in and wash-out indices of the DCE-MRI were calculated. The correlations for each calculated index were compared. Results: There was a significant difference between the tumor and the contralateral normal parts for both fast (p = 0.03) and slow component (p < 0.01) ADCs. In addition, the slow component ADC was correlated with the wash-out index (r = 0.64). Conclusion: The slow component ADC was correlated with the wash-out index, and may, therefore, be a suitable substitute for DCE-MRI. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Brahma (BRM) has recently been documented as a significant predictor of pancreatic cancer (PC) metastasis. This study aimed to further elucidate molecular mechanism by which BRM promotes PC metastasis. We found that silencing BRM reduced PC cell migration and invasion both in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by reduced level of miR-302a-3p. BRM positively regulated the transcription of miR-302a-3p, which acted as a metastasis-promoting miRNA in PC cells. miR-302a-3p directly targeted SOCS5 to boost STAT3 phosphorylation and induce the transcription of STAT3 target genes. Furthermore, miR-302a-3p level was higher in tissue and plasma samples derived from PC patients, and was significantly associated with worse clinical pathological features. In xenograft models, inhibiting miR-302a-3p was synergistically lethal in BRM-silenced PC cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that transcriptional regulation of miR-302a-3p by BRM potentiates PC metastasis by epigenetically suppressing SOCS5 expression and activating STAT3 signaling. These new findings provide potential therapeutic avenues for preventing PC-associated death. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The application of MCM-41 functionalized by 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) as drug carrier for cancer treatment was studied by loading of camptothecin (CPT). In-vitro controlled release study of CPT in Simulated Body Fluid (pH 7.4, 37 °C) was carried out under stirring as well as static conditions. The systems were also evaluated on cancer cells (HepG2) and the carriers are found to be non-toxic to the cancer cells. In order to see the influence of inorganic moiety on release rate of drug, study was also carried out with CPT loaded unfunctionalized MCM-41. A detailed study on release kinetics and release mechanism using First Order Release Kinetic Model, Higuchi Model, Koresmeyer-Pepps Model and Extended kinetic model was also carried out. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "As one group of emerging pollutants, the threat of organophosphate esters (flame retardants and plasticizers, OPEs) to drinking water safety is not well recognized. Now, the oral reference dose (RfD) and oral cancer slope factor (SFO) of OPEs have been updated by USPEA, therefore the threat of OPEs to drinking water safety could be assessed. In this study, occurrence, health risk and key impact factor of OPEs in drinking water of China were analyzed covering 79 cities, whose population and gross domestic product (GDP) accounted for 28.8% and 44.1% of them in China, respectively. Total concentration of 14 common OPEs in drinking water was 13.42–265.48 ng/L. The exposure level of OPEs via ingestion of drinking water was much lower than that of food ingestion but was comparable with dust ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption. A health assessment for OPEs via ingestion of drinking water suggested that the potential cancer risk occurred (>1.00E-6) but no obvious non-carcinogenic effects occurred (<1). Tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (TDBPP) contributed to about 72.4% of carcinogenic risk, which should be treated as “prior monitoring OPEs” in further studies. The occurrence and distribution of OPEs in drinking water of China have a good corresponding relationship with the Aihui-Tengchong Line, and drinking water treatment technology (DWTT) was found to be a key factor. Total OPEs, halogeno-OPEs and alkyl-OPEs in drinking water from advanced DWTT cities were much lower than those of conventional DWTT cities. Compared with conventional DWTT, advanced DWTT could reduce about 65.6% and 36.5% of carcinogenic risk and non-carcinogenic risk of OPEs, respectively. Considering the annual growth of OPEs consumption in China and world, further studies regarding the environmental threat of OPEs are required. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Antiandrogens have a peculiar place in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer by blocking the androgen receptor (AR). Unfortunately, aggressive tumors could rapidly develop into a castration resistant state. It is therefore essential to look for new molecules that are more effective, affecting not only the androgen signaling and with minimum undesirable effects. Natural products are an interesting source of new therapeutics, especially for cancer therapy as 70% of them have botanical origin. Based on an ethnobotany screening, we evaluated the effects of ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) from Algeria on LNCaP cells. Results pointed out that EEP reduces the survival of LNCaP cells with an IC 50 of 0.04 mg/ml, induces the apoptosis and blocks the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Interestingly, EEP decreased the accumulation of AR suggesting some anti-androgen activity. Indeed, secreted amount of the androgen target protein PSA was decreased when LNCaP cells were incubated with EEP, starting after 4 h of treatment. This anti-androgen activity was also shown on the androgen target genes Fkbp5 and Sgk1. Finally, the capacity of EEP to block AR functioning was demonstrated in transient transfections with human AR and the reporter gene ARE-tk-Luc. Propolis antagonizes the induction of the luciferase activity induced by the natural androgen DHT (10 −8 M) or the synthetic AR agonist R1881 (10 -7 M). Altogether, these results highlight the potential pharmacological effects of EEP in future treatments of prostate cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD) types 1 and 2 are primarily associated with glucocorticoid inactivation and reactivation. Several adrenal C11-oxy C 19 and C11-oxy C 21 steroids, which have been identified in prostate cancer, 21-hydroxylase deficiency and polycystic ovary syndrome, are substrates for these isozymes. This study describes the kinetic parameters of 11βHSD1 and 11βHSD2 towards the C11-keto and C11-hydroxy derivatives of the C 19 and C 21 steroids. The apparent K m and V max values indicate the more prominent 11βHSD2 activity towards 11β-hydroxy androstenedione, 11β-hydroxytestosterone and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone in contrast to the 11βHSD1 reduction of the C11-keto steroids, as was demonstrated in the LNCaP cell model in the production of 11-ketotestosterone and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone. Data highlighted the role of 11βHSD2 and cytochrome P450 17A1 in the contribution of C11-oxy C 21 steroids to the C11-oxy C 19 steroid pool in the C11-oxy backdoor pathway. In addition, 11βHSD2 activity, catalysing 11-ketotestosterone biosynthesis, was shown to be key in the production of prostate specific antigen and in the progression of prostate cancer to castration resistant prostate cancer. The study at hand thus provides evidence that 11βHSD isozymes play key roles in pathophysiological states, more so than was previously put forward. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Chemotherapy-induced phlebitis (CIP) is one of the most important and common complications in patients with cancer. Currently, the use of complementary methods to prevent or alleviate phlebitis symptoms has attracted great attention. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of topical sesame oil in reducing the pain severity of CIP. Materials and methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients with colorectal cancer afflicted with CIP. Patients received, twice a day for seven consecutive days, a 5-min massage solely (as the control group) or with 10 drops of sesame oil (as the experimental group) within the 10 cm radius of the affected site. The pain severity was evaluated by the visual analog scale on the first, third, fifth, and seventh days of the intervention. Results: Mean changes of the pain severity compared to the baseline were significant on the third (P = 0.009), fifth (P &lt; 0.001), and seventh (P &lt; 0.001) days of the intervention in favor of the experimental group. Also, a significant reduction in the pain severity both in the experimental and control groups was observed during the seven days (F = 720.66, Ptime &lt; 0.001); however, the decrease was more significant in the experimental group (F = 21.46, Pgroup &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Application of massage with sesame oil as a complementary method is effective in reducing the pain severity of patients with CIP. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Hyperthermia—increasing temperature of cancerous tissue for a short period of time—is considered as an effective treatment for various cancer types such as malignant bone tumors. Superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic particles have been studied for their hyperthermic properties in treating various types of cancers. The activation of magnetic nanoparticles by an alternating magnetic field is currently being explored as a technique for targeted therapeutic heating of different tumors and is being studied as an adjuvant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the case of bone cancers, to increase the efficiency of treatment in the hyperthermia therapy, employed materials should support bone regeneration as well. Magnetite is one of the most attractive magnetic nanoceramics used in hyperthermia application. However, biocompatibility and bioactivity of this material have raised questions. There is a high demand for extremely efficient hyperthermia materials which are equally biocompatible to non-tumor cells and tissues. We report the development of a biocompatible and bioactive material with desirable magnetic properties that show excellent hyperthermia properties and can be used for destruction of the cancerous tissue in addition to supporting tissue regeneration for treatment of bone tumors. In the current study, iron (Fe 3+ )-containing HT nanostructured material was prepared, and its biocompatibility, bioactivity, and hyperthermia abilities were studied. The developed materials showed effective hyperthermic properties with increased biocompatibility as compared to magnetite. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: To assess multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) characteristics in prostate cancer (PCa) before and after irreversible electroporation (IRE) and to investigate their correlation with the presence of post-operative recurrence of PCa. Methods: MpMRI was performed in 30 men with PCa prior to treatment, after 10 days and at 6 months. An additional scan at 1 year was available for 18 men. Two radiologists assessed retrospectively the following parameters by planimetry: tumour volume, necrotic volume (early post-treatment scan) and residual fibrosis. Residual tumour/recurrence were defined as a suspicious area within the treatment field scored ≥ 4 on a 1-to-5 scale. Oncological outcome was also assessed. Results: The median follow-up of the entire study was 16 months. Six men were undertreated and showed mpMRI recurrence after 6 months. At 1-year, three additional men had recurrence. Overall, four of these 9 men (44%) were retreated. The other five men did not receive any further treatment. Median time to re-treatment was 15 months. Median pre-treatment lesion volume was 0.65 cc, 0.66 cc and 0.43 cc on the different mpMRI sequences (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging). Median necrotic volume was 10.77 cc. Median overall residual fibrosis volume were 0.84 cc and 0.95 cc at 6-month and 1-year mpMRI. Pre-treatment, necrotic and residual fibrosis volumes were significantly different (p < 0.001). Pre-treatment tumour volumes on diffusion-weighted imaging and necrotic volumes were correlated (r = 0.18; p = 0.02). Conclusions: MpMRI is able to visualise the IRE ablation effects in men with PCa. MpMRI-derived parameters - such as tumour, necrotic and fibrosis volumes - can be measured and are potentially useful for assessing efficacy in the medium term, as with other ablative techniques. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The aim of this study is to determine whether Likert scale (Deauville criteria) can be used to classify oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) patients as ‘responders’ and ‘nonresponders’ by utilizing FDG-PET/CT for primary tumor site. The second aim is to compare the performance of methods used in interpretation of posttreatment PET/CT scans (Likert scale, SUVmax, ratios of SUVmax primary lesion to mediastinum ‘SUVmax P/M’ and SUVmax primary lesion to liver ‘SUVmax P/L’) in predicting treatment response. Methods: Seventy-seven PET/CT scans were assessed by Deauville criteria, five-point Likert scale. SUVmax of primary lesion, SUVmax primary to mediastinum and SUVmax primary to liver ratios on first follow-up PET/CT were measured and calculated. Pathology results, clinical and imaging follow-up were used as standart reference. Results: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value of Likert scale were found to be 80%, 89.5%, 53.3% and 96.8% respectively. When Likert scale and PET parameters were compared, no statistically significant difference was found. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to determine the optimal cut-off points for SUVmax (found as 4) and for ratios (SUVmax P/M = 1.67and SUVmax P/L = 1.7) with the highest specificity and NPV. Conclusion: Likert scale adequately categorize patients as ‘responders’ and ‘non-responders’. Since its NPV is high and interpretation is relatively easy, it can be utilized to evaluate OPSCC response to treatment in first follow up FDG PET/CT. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common causes of cervical cancer. It is well documented that expression of two oncogenes (E6/E7) plays a key role in tumor progression. HPV16E7 -targeting via nanobody (Nb) therefore could be beneficial for HPV16-associated cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this work, phage-display approach was employed to select the high affinity HPV16E7-specific Nb. Firstly; a high-quality immune library was constructed. After three round of biopanning, high-affinity HPV16 E7-specific nanobodies were retrieved. By phage ELISA and sequencing, four different sequences of anti- HPV16E7 nanobodies were selected. Then recombinant nanobody Nb2 was cloned and expressed in E. coli, and the specificity and thermal stability of purified Nb2 was evaluated. To examine the potential of Nb2 as an inhibitor of E7 function, Nb2 was expressed within HPV16 positive cells. Proliferation assay showed that the intracellular expressed Nb2 as an intrabody can decrease the growth of HPV16-positive cells. The results indicate that Nb2 as an intracellular antibody directed towards HPV oncoprotein E7 has great promise in applications for the therapy of HPV16-associated disease. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To help guide individualized treatment, we sought to identify baseline predictive factors that impact long-term erectile function following high-dose image-guided radiotherapy (HD-IGRT). Methods: Potent men with localized prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy alone were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved prospective cohort study. Men received HD-IGRT as primary treatment of prostate cancer. Patient-reported inventories were used to assess erectile function at baseline, 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years after treatment. Long-term potency rates were compared to validated models, and baseline factors were used to create a novel, internally validated nomogram for predicting long-term function. Results: 1,159 men were treated with HD-IGRT. Among 676 men who were potent at baseline and did not receive hormone therapy, the potency rates at 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years were 81%, 68%, and 61%. Recursive partitioning categorized patients into 3 groups based on two factors: baseline response to EPIC Q57 (ability to have an erection) and pre-existing heart disease. At 5 years, the most favorable group reported “very good” on Q57 and had an 80% potency rate (n = 137; p = 0.83); the intermediate group reported “good” on Q57 and had no baseline cardiac disease with a 62% potency rate (n = 145; p = 0.86); and the remaining poor risk group had a 37% potency rate (n = 117; p = 0.19). Conclusions: Patient-reported pretreatment sexual function and comorbidities enables stratification and prediction of erectile function. EPIC subset questions with baseline comorbidities may potentially serve as a quick and practical clinical tool for predicting sexual survivorship. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is a prominent cause of death among women worldwide. Recent studies have demonstrated that artemisinin (ART) displays anti-tumor activity. Using a mouse breast cancer model, we investigated the effects of ART in vitro and in vivo to determine how it influences the anti-tumor immune response. Methods: We measured the proliferation and apoptosis of 4T1 cells in vitro after ART treatment by MTT assay and FACS. To examine the effects of ART in vivo, tumor volumes and survival rates were measured in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. FACS was used to determine the frequencies of Tregs, MDSCs, CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells, and CTLs in the tumors and spleens of the mice. mRNA levels of the transcription factors T-bet and FOXP3 and cytokines IFN-γ TNF-α TGF-β and IL-10 were also determined by real-time RT-PCR. ELISA was used to measure TGF-β protein levels in the cell culture supernatants. Results: ART supplementation significantly increased 4T1 cell apoptosis and decreased TGF-β levels in vitro. ART also impeded tumor growth in 4T1 TB mice and extended their survival. MDSC and Treg frequencies significantly decreased in the 4T1 TB mice after ART treatment while CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells and CTLs significantly increased. ART significantly increased T-bet, IFN-γ and TNF-α mRNA levels within the tumor and significantly decreased TGF-β mRNA levels. Conclusion: ART supplementation hindered 4T1 tumor growth in vivo by promoting T cell activation and quelling immunosuppression from Tregs and MDSCs in the tumor. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, pH responsive, breast cancer targeted mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been developed as a carrier with a view to overcome problems such as non-selectivity, low cellular uptake and side effects associated with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs and improve their therapeutic efficacy. MCM-41 type of MSNs was synthesized using modified Stober's process and further modified by first reacting with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and then succinic anhydride (SA) in order to obtain carboxylic acid functionalized MSN-COOH. Anastrozole was loaded into the MSNs and then capped with chitosan-folate conjugate. The MSNs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential analysis, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), HPLC and UV-visible spectroscopy. In vitro release studies confirmed triggered drug release from these nanoparticles under acidic (pH 5.5) environment. Hemolysis study proved that the formulation was safe for intravenous administration. The formulation exhibited 1.5 folds higher cytotoxicity as compared to free drug indicating its improved therapeutic potency. The in-vivo anticancer activity of formulations was studied against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) induced breast cancer in Balb C mice in which these nanoparticles showed superior anticancer activity. Excellent tumor suppressing activity was demonstrated by these nanoparticles against EAC induced breast cancer model. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Recent evidence has highlighted that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are associated with many diseases, particularly cancer. However, current understanding of the lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains limited. Our studies indicated that the DLEU1 expression level was upregulated in PDAC tissue samples compared with adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, the aberrant overexpression of DLEU1 indicated poor prognosis of patients with PDAC. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that DLEU1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PDAC cells in vitro and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-381 potentially targeted the DLEU1 3′-untranslated region (UTR), suggesting an interaction between miR-381 and DLEU1. Furthermore, miR-381 also targeted the chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) messenger RNA 3′-UTR, which was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, our study demonstrated the oncogenic role of DLEU1 in clinical PDAC specimens and cellular experiments, showing the potential involvement of DLEU1/miR-381/CXCR4 pathway. These results provide novel insight into PDAC tumorigenesis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

She was found to have focal amplification of ERBB2 confirmed by amplification and overexpression of HER2/neu via fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Given the identification of this potential target and progression of disease, trastuzumab was added to the patient's chemotherapy regimen with ultimate complete response. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study aims to investigate the effect of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibition on cisplatin (DDP)-resistant gastric cancer (GC) cells. Methods: The transcriptional level of PLK1 was measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expressions of PLK1 and its downstream mediators as well as autophagy-related protein LC3 I/LC3 II were detected by western blot. An 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine immunofluorescent staining were conducted to evaluate the cell viability and replication activity separately. Flow cytometry was carried out to determine the cell cycle status. The GFP-LC3 vector contributed toward tracking the formation and aggregation of autophagosomes. Results: Drug-resistant SGC-7901/DDP cells showed insignificant changes in all phases after DDP treatment, including DNA replication, cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis, whereas DDP could significantly improve the autophagy level of SGC-7901/DDP as well as PLK1expression. By downregulating the expression of PLK1, both BI2536 andsi-PLK1 enhanced SGC-7901/DDP sensitivity to DDP, suppressing the proliferation and autophagy as well as improving the apoptosis rate. PLK1 inhibition also resulted in the repression of cell division regulators CDC25C and cyclin B1. Conclusion: Together, our experimental results illustrated that the DDP resistance of GC cells might be associated with the aberrant overexpression of PLK1. PLK1 inhibition, including si-PLK1 and BI2536 treatment, could restore the chemosensitivity of drug-resistant SGC-7901/DDP cells and enhance the efficacy of DDP, revealing the potential value of PLK1 inhibition in GC chemotherapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Natural compounds such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) have previously shown chemotherapeutic properties with few side-effects. In our study, we evaluated the effects of combining EGCG with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and radiotherapy on oral squamous cell cancer. We evaluated whether the combination of lower doses of 5-FU with EGCG could be equally or more effective than the use of higher doses of 5-FU alone. Methods: Cell viability, migration and cell cycles were assayed in oral cancer cell lines treated with 5-FU, 5-FU + EGCG and radiation (0, 2.5 and 5 Gy). Results: This study found that the combination of EGCG with 5-FU reduced cell viability and migration distance compared to control samples and the same dose of 5-FU alone. Addition of EGCG increased the number of cells in the G2/M phase, while 5-FU arrested the cell cycle in phase S. Moreover, cell exposure to 5 Gy radiation decreased the effects of combining with EGCG. Conclusions: In summary, the combination of EGCG and 5-FU reduced both cell viability and migration as well as altered the cell cycle to a greater extent than 5-FU alone. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The study was carried out to evaluate the influence of probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum (NCDC 012), Lactobacillus casei (NCDC 297), and Lactobacillus brevis (NCDC 021)) on anti-proliferative, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory activities of kalari cheese. Effect of these probiotics on cheese microstructure, structure, and thermal properties was also studied. The anti-proliferative activity of probiotic cheese water-soluble extract (WSE) was significantly higher against human breast cancer cells, colon cancer cells, neuroblastoma and transformed human embryonic kidney cells compared to cheese without added probiotics. Anti-microbial, α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition activity and immuno-modulatory activity also increased by incorporating probiotics to Kalari. Attenuated transform reflectance- Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectrum of water-soluble extract (WSE) of probiotic cheese showed new regions between 3000 and 2800 cm −1 and 1400-1200 cm −1 . Decrease in onset, peak and endset temperature was observed in WSE of probiotic cheese. Overall results demonstrated that addition of probiotics enhanced nutraceutical potential of Kalari and that might be attributed to the generation of bioactive peptides by the proteolytic activity of the probiotics. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "This work reports the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil as well as antioxidant and anti-cancer activities of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from leaf and stem of Stachys schtschegleevii. The structure of volatile parts and effective phenolic compounds as biological macromolecules as well as biological activity of the Stachys schtschegleevii plant were studied using various methods. Essential oils of stem and leaf were identified by steam distillation method and characterization was performed using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Anti-microbial activity of extracted macromolecules from essential oils of two ethyl acetate and aqueous parts of stem and leaf were analyzed by minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) method. The crude extracts exhibited no appreciable antioxidant activities, in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test by IC 50 317.98 and 328.09 μg/mL for aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions, respectively. But, antioxidant activities for butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as a standard antioxidant showed significant results (18.16 μg/mL). Also, it was confirmed that antioxidant activities with the phenolic and flavonoid content of the plant for the aqueous and ethyl acetate elements were obtained 57.73, 59.81 and 21.95, 26.124 μg/mg, respectively. Furthermore, in β-carotene/linoleic acid assay, inhibition percentages were recorded 71.17 and 96.24 for the aqueous and ethyl acetate elements, respectively. Therefore, ethyl acetate section of the plant showed antioxidant activity more than aqueous part. Hydrogen peroxide scavenging assay evaluated antioxidant activity for aqueous and the ethyl acetate extracts sections as 565 and 560 μg/mL, respectively. Also, power determinations of iron (III) oxide antioxidants from aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions were 6113 and 2.69, respectively. Furthermore, Anti-cancer activity of aqueous and ethyl acetate components evaluated in brine shrimp lethality test with LC 50 about 100 and 700 μg/mL for aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions, respectively. The results showed that aqueous section species has a much lower effect than the calculated standard, but ethyl acetate section of the plant sample shows a more favorable effect than the standard. Therefore, the plant screened good antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-cancer activities for its essential oil and ethyl acetate extract. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor proliferation is an important biomarker indicative of the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Assessment of tumor proliferation in a clinical setting is a highly subjective and labor-intensive task. Previous efforts to automate tumor proliferation assessment by image analysis only focused on mitosis detection in predefined tumor regions. However, in a real-world scenario, automatic mitosis detection should be performed in whole-slide images (WSIs) and an automatic method should be able to produce a tumor proliferation score given a WSI as input. To address this, we organized the TUmor Proliferation Assessment Challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) on prediction of tumor proliferation scores from WSIs. The challenge dataset consisted of 500 training and 321 testing breast cancer histopathology WSIs. In order to ensure fair and independent evaluation, only the ground truth for the training dataset was provided to the challenge participants. The first task of the challenge was to predict mitotic scores, i.e., to reproduce the manual method of assessing tumor proliferation by a pathologist. The second task was to predict the gene expression based PAM50 proliferation scores from the WSI. The best performing automatic method for the first task achieved a quadratic-weighted Cohen's kappa score of κ = 0.567, 95% CI [0.464, 0.671] between the predicted scores and the ground truth. For the second task, the predictions of the top method had a Spearman's correlation coefficient of r = 0.617, 95% CI [0.581 0.651] with the ground truth. This was the first comparison study that investigated tumor proliferation assessment from WSIs. The achieved results are promising given the difficulty of the tasks and weakly-labeled nature of the ground truth. However, further research is needed to improve the practical utility of image analysis methods for this task. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Pt(II) and Cu(II) complexes, trans-[PtCl 2 (7AI3CAH) 2 ] and [CuBr 2 (7AI3CAH) 2 ] n , containing 7-azaindole-3-carboxaldehyde (7AI3CAH) have been synthesized and investigated by a single crystal X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and DFT calculations. In the platinum(II) complex two pyridine nitrogen atoms of the 7AI3CAH ligands and two chloride ligands are coordinated to the central metal atom, in a square-planar trans arrangement. In the polymeric copper(II) complex the coordination geometry is a tetragonal bipyramid (4 + 2), where the in-plane ligands are two pyridine nitrogen atoms of two organic ligands and two trans-bromide ligands. The apical positions of bipyramid are occupied by the two Br ligands from the neighboring units. Thus, the Cu Br Br Cu double bridge system is formed. Detailed vibrational assignments of the IR and Raman spectra of the Pt(II) and Cu(II) complexes have been made on the basis of the calculated potential energy distributions (PEDs) using B3LYP method. The in vitro antiproliferative activity of trans-[PtCl 2 (7AI3CAH) 2 ] was studied against different human cancer cell lines. The results have shown that this complex is comparably cytotoxic with cisplatin at the LoVo (colon cancer) and MCF7 (breast cancer) cells, whilst its cytotoxicity is significantly lower against the A549 cells (lung cancer) as compared to cisplatin. However, it is about 8-fold less toxic than cisplatin against a normal fibroblast cell line (BALB/3T3). A study on stability of trans-[PtCl 2 (7AI3CAH) 2 ] in DMSO solution has been performed by FT-IR (ATR) spectroscopy to predict a possible binding mode of trans-platinum(II) complex with DNA. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Interleukin-24 (IL-24) is known for its tumor suppressive activity and the selective induction of apoptosis of numerous human cancer cells, while demonstrating little harm to normal cells. However, poor tumor penetration remains a key problem for the efficacy of IL-24 as a treatment. The iRGD (CRGDK/RGPDC) is a novel tumor-specific peptide with unique tumor-penetrating and cell-internalizing properties. To enhance the tumor-penetrating effects of IL-24, the iRGD peptide was fused with the C-terminal domain of IL-24 to generate a novel recombinant protein, IL-24-iRGD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effects of IL-24-iRGD in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that IL-24-iRGD increased the production of IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ from human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC), and suppressed cell growth of A549 in vitro. Then A549 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and these tumor-bearing mice were immunized with IL-24, IL-24-iRGD or PBS via the tail vein. The IL-24 and IL-24-iRGD-treated groups exhibited tumor growth inhibition rates of 26.2% and 59.1%, respectively, when compared with the PBS-treated group. Protein penetration into tumors was analyzed by immunofluorescence, cell apoptosis was examined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was analyzed by immuno-histochemical staining. The results demonstrated that IL-24-iRGD induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of A549 cells to a significantly greater extent when compared with IL-24 treatment alone. It may provide an improved strategy for antitumor therapy and the clinical treatment of NSCLC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this work, dual thermo- and pH-responsive hydrogels were developed and loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) with potential therapy of breast cancer. Hydrogels were engineered by blending synthesized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-itaconic acid) (PNIAAm-co-IA) with chitosan (CS) through ionic crosslinking using glycerophosphate (GP). The synthesized copolymer and hydrogels were characterized by means of various techniques such as FT-IR, 1 H NMR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the copolymer was determined around 39 °C using UV–Vis spectroscopy. Swelling studies of hydrogels and their morphology implied the porous structure, high water content with rapid swelling/deswelling rate in response to abrupt changes of pH and temperature. The release investigation of DOX at different concentration, temperature and pH values confirmed the accelerated release of DOX in lower concentration and acidic condition at 37 °C as compared to neutral pH and the temperature of 40 °C. The MTT cytotoxicity study revealed that the hydrogels are cytocompatible and exert no/negligible cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells. The proliferation of MCF-7 cells on the prepared hydrogel and DOX-loaded hydrogel was evaluated by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining which further demonstrated the potential of developed hydrogels for local therapy of breast cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To characterize daily geometrical variations of gastrointestinal organs with respect to pancreatic tumors, through a population-based statistical model. Materials and methods: The study included 131 CT scans from 35 pancreatic cancer patients treated with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT). For each patient, day-to-day anatomical variations of the stomach, the duodenum and the bowel were assessed from the deformation vector fields (DVF) obtained by non-rigidly registering the contours of the fractions to the planning CT scans. For the whole population, day-to-day motion-deformation patterns were abstracted using principal component analysis (PCA) on the set of DVFs mapped on a reference patient. Based on these geometrical variations, anatomies were generated to create population-based dose-volume histograms (DVH) per patient, which were also compared to clinical values. Results: Through PCA, the most dominant directions of daily deformations were localized in the abdominal organs. Common patterns were found, such as stomach contraction–expansion in the anterior–posterior direction ranging from 5 to 13 mm, and superior-inferior deformations on the bowel from 7 to 14 mm. The duodenum resulted to move laterally, but in a lesser extent (4–8 mm). The population-based DVHs derived from the model mostly included the daily DVHs observed in the clinic (in >90% of the cases). Conclusions: Anatomical variations influence the delivered doses to healthy organs during SBRT. A motion model was successfully built and explored to extract the larger directions of movement of the gastrointestinal organs. Day-to-day motion modeling can potentially be used to account for geometrical uncertainties in future plan optimization and in online adaptive strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of image heterogeneity analysis of standard care magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) to predict chemoradiotherapy (CRT) outcome. The ability to predict disease recurrence following CRT has the potential to inform personalized radiotherapy approaches currently being explored in novel clinical trials. Methods: An IRB waiver was obtained for retrospective analysis of standard care MRIs from ASCC patients presenting between 2010 and 2014. Whole tumor 3D volume-of-interest (VOI) was outlined on T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of the pre- and post-treatment scans. Independent imaging features most predictive of disease recurrence were added to the baseline clinico-pathological model and the predictive value of respective extended models was calculated using net reclassification improvement (NRI) algorithm. Cross-validation analysis was carried out to determine percentage error reduction with inclusion of imaging features to the baseline model for both endpoints. Results: Forty patients who underwent 1.5 T pelvic MRI at baseline and following completion of CRT were included. A combination of two baseline MR heterogeneity features (baseline T2w energy and DWI coefficient of variation) was most predictive of disease recurrence resulting in significant NRI (p = 0 < 0.001). This was confirmed in cross-validation analysis with 34.8% percentage error reduction for the primary endpoint and 18.1% reduction for the secondary endpoint with addition of imaging variables to baseline model. Conclusion: MRI heterogeneity analysis offers complementary information, in addition to clinical staging, in predicting outcome of CRT in anal SCC, warranting validation in larger datasets. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the prognostic value of skull-base invasion (SBI) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), propose a subclassification of SBI. Methods: 792 and 433 patients with pathologically proven NPC and complete clinical and magnetic resonance imaging records at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and Foshan Hospital were enrolled, and investigated using heat map/cluster, network and survival analyses. Results: The results of heat map/cluster analyses and network analysis showed that T3 patients with pterygoid process and/or base of the sphenoid bone invasion (T3 slight) had better treatment outcomes than those with other SBIs (T3 severe). Significant differences were observed between T3-slight and T3-severe groups with regard to 5-year overall survival (OS) (93.0% vs. 83.5%, p = 0.014) and progression-free survival (PFS) (82.5% vs. 74.1%, p = 0.044) rates. No significant difference was observed between T3-slight group and T2 patients with regard to 5-year OS (93.0% vs. 84.7%, p = 0.062) and PFS (82.5% vs. 78.9%, p = 0.459) rates. Therefore, we downgraded patients with T3 slight to T2, yielding a new T classification sample. The survival curves of the 5-year OS and PFS rates of T2 and T3 were more reasonable after sample redistribution than those before sample redistribution. The differences in the 5-year OS and PFS rates between T2 and T3 patients after sample redistribution approached significance (p = 0.075 and 0.051, respectively). Conclusions: Different types of SBIs had different effects on the prognosis for NPC. We recommend patients with T3 slight not be defined as T3 but, rather, as T2. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between iodine intake and clinicopathologic characteristics of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is unclear. We aim to investigate the relationship between iodine intake and central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) of PTC. A total of 4040 consecutive patients with PTC receiving thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection were enrolled from 2013 to 2018. Pathological features of tumors and urinary iodine concentration (UIC) were recorded. Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between iodine intake and CLNM of PTC. More than adequate (UIC: 200.0-299.9 μg/L) and excessive iodine intake (UIC ≥ 300.0 μg/L) were present in 1741 cases (43.09%). Iodine deficiency (UIC ≤ 99.9 μg/L) was inversely associated with female PTC risk only with OR (95% CI): 0.48 (0.29–0.80) relative to adequate iodine intake (UIC: 100.0–199.9 μg/L). However, more than adequate and excessive iodine intake was not associated with PTC risk among the general population and patients with thyroid nodules. In addition, high iodine intake was not associated CLNM risk of PTC. After defining CLNM as metastatic lymph nodes ≥ 2, excessive iodine intake was marginally associated with CLNM among female PTC patients with OR (95% CI): 1.25 (0.99–1.57) by multivariate analysis. Additionally, excessive iodine intake was marginally associated with larger tumor size and capsular invasion. Furthermore, we found that female PTC patients were more closely linked with iodine intake than male ones. In conclusion, high iodine intake appears not to be an initiator, but may be a weak promoter for female PTC progression, which needs further validation. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying HCC progression and metastasis are still in obscure. Here, we used bioinformatic analysis to identify miRNAs that regulate GP73, a specific marker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. The correlations between miR-141-3p and clinic-pathological factors were analyzed in HCC patient samples; proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation were studied using established HCC cell lines. Expression levels of target genes (miR-141-3p, GP73, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, occludin, vimentin, and cytokeratin 18) were detected by either Western blot or qRT-PCR analysis. Xenograft models were established to evaluate tumor growth and metastasis. MiR-141-3p was significantly reduced in HCC tumors and cell lines, highly correlated with tumor progression. In contrast, GP73 was negatively correlated with miR-141-3p in HCC tumors. MiR-141-3p overexpression significantly decreased HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). GP73 overexpression partially restored the inhibitory effects of miR-141-3p, while miR-141-3p overexpression markedly inhibited tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, which were partially reversed by GP73 overexpression. Our findings suggest that miR-141-3p targets GP73 to reverse EMT, subsequently inhibiting HCC progression and metastasis. Thus, overexpression of miR-141-3p could serve as a therapeutic strategy to arrest HCC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cell sorting from heterogeneous organisms and tissues composed of multi-type cells is of great importance in biological and clinical applications. As promising cell sorting methods, dielectrophoresis (DEP) and hydrodynamics are attracting much attention in recent years. In this paper, we report a novel strategy by coupling DEP unit (3D sidewall electrodes) and hydrodynamic unit (microchannels with contraction/expansion structures) together in one microfluidic chip. Depending on the relative positions of 3D sidewall electrodes and contraction/expansion structure, three microchips (full-coupling, semi-coupling and non-coupling) are developed and their cell sorting performance are compared by isolating lung cancer cells (PC-9 cells) from red blood cells (RBCs). Both finite element simulation and practical cell sorting prove that high cell sorting efficiency (recovery of PC-9 cells: 90.21%, recovery of RBCs: 94.35%) can be achieved in full-coupling microchip, mainly owing to the synergistic effects between DEP sorting and hydrodynamic sorting. i.e., the positive DEP force generated by 3D sidewall electrodes can simultaneously act as an additional shear gradient lift force and thus trigger secondary flow even at low flow velocity. Live/dead cell staining, hemolysis ratio, fluorescence images and CCK-8 assay prove that RBCs and PC-9 cells show no significance difference in cell viability before and after cell sorting. The proposed coupling platform for cell sorting brings on a new pathway to construct integrated microfluidic chips for effective cell sorting and separation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Efforts were taken to synthesis and characterize 2-amino-1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4(5H)-one derivatives (4a-u) through a four-step reaction. The achieved compounds in remarkable yield have characterized through standard analytical techniques such as FTIR, LC-MS, NMR, HRMS, and elemental analysis. Present study mainly aimed to evaluate 4a-u as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). In the mechanism, stimulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt (protein kinase B) is a general reaction activated by a series of membrane-bound receptors such as GPCR. Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) is a subfamily of related GPCR, which triggered by the division of fragment of its extracellular domain. Therefore, molecular docking is done to ensure the inhibition of PAR1 and PI3Kinase. PI3Kinase is a chief enzyme in the development of breast cancer via the Akt/mTOR pathway. Thus, in vitro PI3Kinase inhibition and anti-breast cancer studies has also done to screen medicinally important compounds among (4a-u). Based on the best binding affinity, in vitro relative % activity and IC 50 values, compounds 4a, 4g, 4i, 4n, and 4u were screened for further preclinical studies in animal model evaluations. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Bio-heat transfer is a branch of bio-medical engineering which has its foundation linked to engineering disciplines of heat transfer. The thermal properties and behaviour of various malfunctioning tissues in human body varies as compared with normal tissues. Among various cancer tissues one which is commonly diagnosed in women is breast cyst (cancer causing fluid). The aim of present work is to develop one, two and three-dimensional computational models to study bio-heat transfer problems using finite difference method. First of all, a numerical model based on finite difference method is developed to solve Pennes's bio-heat transfer equation in one-dimension to get temperature profiles normal to skin surface and validated with existing analytical solutions. Secondly, the numerical model is extended to study the thermal behaviour of human breast section embedded with cyst using two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate systems and validated with previous researcher's results. The effect of size, location and presence of multiple cysts on surface temperature is studied. Lastly, the work is extended for the case of three-dimensional breast section with cyst located at the centre. The numerical results obtained using one, two and three-dimensional computational models will be highly helpful in the early detection of breast cancer tissues and also the location of it inside the body. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to study the effect of ω-3 supplementation on the nutritional status and the immune and inflammatory profiles of patients with gastric cancer during antineoplastic pretreatment. Methods: This was a randomized, open, controlled longitudinal study with intervention in outpatient patients with gastric cancer. Sixty-eight patients were randomized into two groups and received either a formula enriched with ω-3 (intervention group [IG]) or standard formula without ω-3 (control group) for 30 d consecutively. Nutritional status (based on patient-generated subjective global assessment, bioimpedance, and anthropometric measurements) and immune and inflammatory parameters were collected before and after supplementation. Results were expressed as frequency, median, and interquartile intervals and were compared by non-parametric test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Thirty-four patients were included in each group. Of the patients, 64.7% were men, 44.1% were older than 60 years, and 45.6% had stage III disease. There was an increase in C-reactive protein in the control group before and after supplementation, in addition to the worsening in some anthropometric parameters, such as arm muscle area and arm muscle circumference. There was maintenance of the immune profile in both groups. An increase in weight gain was observed in the IG but not in the control group (1.2 [0.9–9] versus 0.7 kg [0.4–1.3]; P = 0.03), as was a reduction of interleukin-6 (5.7 [4.1–6.4] versus 6.3 pg/mL [5.6–8.6]; P = 0.03) and a maintenance of nutritional status, after supplementation. Conclusions: Supplementation with ω-3 leads to weight gain, reduction in the inflammatory profile, and maintenance of the nutritional and immune profiles of these patients, but further studies are needed to examine changes in body composition. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), but little is known about the function of lncRNAs in the colorectal liver metastasis (CLM). This study was designed to identify specific lncRNAs correlating to liver metastasis of CRC, and to further assess their clinical value. Seventeen patients with primary CRC lesions, adjacent normal mucosa, and synchronous liver metastases lesions were divided into discovery set (six patients) and test set (11 patients). Transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) was used to screen differential expression of lncRNAs in the discovery set. Based on bioinformatics data, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the target lncRNA in test set. The relationships between target lncRNA and clinical values were analysed in an expanded validation set of additional 91 patients. 23 upregulated and 14 downregulated lncRNAs were detected for distinguishing synchronous liver metastases, primary CRC lesions from adjacent normal mucosa in the RNAseq set. The expression levels of four lncRNAs in the 37 lncRNA signature were verified by qRT-PCR in the test set. Compared with the paired normal mucosa, high expression levels of lnc-small-nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) were detected not only in primary CRC lesions but also in liver metastases lesions in the test set. Furthermore, in the expanded validation set, high expression of lnc-SNHG15 was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis and liver metastasis (p < 0.05), and patients displaying high lncRNA-SNHG15 expression exhibited a shorter median overall survival duration than those displaying low expression (30.7 vs. 35.2 months; p = 0.003). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that lncRNA-SNHG15 overexpression may serve as a poor prognostic biomarker for CRC patients (p = 0.049; Cox's regression: 2.731). Lnc-SNHG15 overexpression was significantly associated with CLM and high-expression of lnc-SNHG15 in CRC was an independent predictor of poor survival. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the impact of long noncodingRNA (lncRNA) colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) on hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cell propagation, invasion, and migration by mediating miR-203/ BCAT1 axis. Methods: Microarray analysis was based on 25 pairs of HCC cancerous tissues and adjacent tissues. The expression levels of CRNDE, miR-203, and BCAT1 in HCC tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The liver cell line L-02 and HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh-7 were utilized to assess the regulatory eﬀects of CRNDE and miR-203 on HCC progression in vitro. Western blot was used to qualify BCAT1 protein expression level. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis, whereas cell invasion and migration assay were performed by the Transwell assay. The relationship among CRNDE, miR-203, and BCAT1 was validated by dual luciferase assay. Tumor Xenograft study was established to verify the pathological effect of CRNDE on HCC development in vivo. Results: The expression levels of the CRNDE and BCAT1 were upregulated in HCC tissues and cells, whereas miR-203 was downregulated in HCC. Knockdown of CRNDE or miR-203 overexpression would inhibit HCC cell propagation and metastasis, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-203 was negatively correlated with CRNDE, the same as miR-203 with BCAT1. Dual luciferase assay showed that miR-203 was an inhibitory target of CRNDE, and BCAT1 was directly targeted by miR-203 as well. Conclusion: LncRNA CRNDE could enhance HCC tumorgenesis by sponging miR-203 and mediating BCAT1. LncRNA CRNDE might facilitate HCC cell propagation, invasiveness, and migration through regulating miR-203/ BCAT1 axis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Survival of epithelial ovarian cancer patients remains poor without significant change over many decades. There is a need to better identify women at high risk (HR) for ovarian cancer. We propose that miRNA dysregulation may play critical roles in the early stages of ovarian cancer development. Circulating miRNAs may represent an important biomarker in this context, and miRNA profiling of serum in women at HR compared to those at low risk (LR) may give insights in tumor initiation pathways. There is also rationale for a specific focus on regulation of the androgen and its related hypoxia pathways in tumor initiation. We hypothesized that subsets of these pathway related miRNAs may be downregulated in the HR state. Serum from four HR and five LR women were sequenced and analyzed for 2083 miRNAs. We found 137 miRNAs dysregulated between the HR and LR groups, of which 36 miRNAs were overexpressed in HR and the vast majority (101 miRNAs or 74%) downregulated in the HR, when compared to LR serum. mRNA targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed from three different miRNA-mRNA interaction resources. Functional association analysis of hypoxia and androgen pathway mRNA targets of dysregulated miRNAs in HR serum revealed that all but one of the miRNAs that target 52 hypoxia genes were downregulated in HR compared to LR serum. Androgen pathway analysis also had a similar expression pattern where all but one of the miRNAs that target these 135 identified genes were downregulated in HR serum. Overall, there were 91 differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairings in the hypoxia analysis. In the androgen-related analysis, overall, there were 429 differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairs. Our pilot study suggests that almost all miRNAs that are conserved and/or validated are downregulated in the HR compared to LR serum. This study, which requires validation, suggests that, via miRNA dysregulation, involvement of both hypoxia and its related androgen pathways may contribute to the HR state. This pilot study is the first report to our knowledge that studies circulating miRNA profiling of HR and LR women. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cancer worldwide, which is related with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Notably, ruthenium-based complexes have emerged as good alternative to the currently used platinum-based drugs for cancer therapy. In the present study, we synthesized a novel bis-pyrimidine based ligand 1,3-bis(2-methyl-6-(pyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)benzene (L) and used it in the synthesis of a dimetallic Ru(II) cymene complex [(Ru(η 6 -p-cymene)Cl) 2 (1,3-bis(2-methyl-6-(pyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)benzene)] (L-Ru). We checked the stability of this complex in solution state in D 2 O/DMSO‑d 6 mixture and found it to be highly stable under these conditions. We determined the anticancer activity and mechanism of action of L-Ru in human NSCLC A549 and A427 by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and related biological analyses. These results revealed that L-Ru exerted a strong inhibitory effect on the cells proliferation,G0/G1-arrest, accompanied with upregulation of p53, p21, p15, cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein and downregulation of cell cycle markers. L-Ru inhibited cell migration and invasion. The mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of NSCLC induced by L-Ru was also observed followed by the increase of apoptosis regulator B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X (BAX), and activation of caspase-3/-9. The effects of L-Ru on the cell viability, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells and Annexin V-positive cells apoptosis induction were remarkably attenuated. This complex induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and cell death via caspase-dependent apoptosis involving PARP activation and induction of p53-dependent pathway. These findings suggested that this ruthenium complex might be a potential effective chemotherapeutic agent in NSCLC therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Phosphoester compounds are promising materials with expected biocompatibility; however, little has been reported on the use of phosphoester compounds for micelle formulations. In this study, paclitaxel (PTX)–encapsulated micelles were prepared using four kinds of alkyl di(MePEG-lactate) phosphates. From the results of the determination of critical micelle concentrations and an in vitro stability test, it was shown that a compound to which 1-eicosanol was introduced as a side chain was desirable in the preparation of PTX-encapsulated micelles (PTX-micelles). The mean volume diameter and PTX content of the micelles were 135.7 ± 52.2 nm and 3.9% ± 0.2%, respectively. in vitro release tests of the micelles were performed at different pH levels. Twenty-four hours after the start of the release test, the cumulative PTX release rate of PTX-micelles at pH 5.0 reached 96.2%, which was three times higher than that at pH 7.4. As a result of the degradation test of the compound used for the micelle, it was confirmed that this compound degraded faster at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4. The hemolysis rate of drug-free micelles was 0.8%–1.4%, and the biocompatibility of this micelle as a drug carrier was suggested. In addition, the effectiveness of PTX-micelles in cancer treatment was evaluated via biodistribution study. PTX concentration in the tumor was significantly increased in the group administered PTX-micelles as compared with the group administered PTX solution. These results suggest that phosphoester compounds are useful in preparing biocompatible pH-responsive carriers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Diagnosis of cancer by chemotherapy treatment, severe side effects caused by high dosages of cancer drugs include non-controlled cytotoxicity to bone marrow cells and immune cells. To overcome, we have synthesized nanoparticles with controlled sized hydroxyapatite (nHAp) materials doped and co-doped with silver and iron by co-precipitation, yielding materials that can treat both the infections and malignant tumors with non-cytotoxic nature to normal cells. Spherical and rod like morphologies were observed for the samples with higher Ag + doping concentrations with average size of 50 ± 5 nm and (75 × 22) ± 5 nm 2 , whereas higher Ag + /Fe 2+ co-doping concentrations yielded samples with spherical, rod-like, and flake-like structures. For samples nHAp and Ag + -nHAp samples were diamagnetic, whereas the Fe 2+ -nHAp and Ag + /Fe 2+ co-doped samples were superparamagnetic. The in vitro biological toxicity study revealed that the Ag + /Fe 2+ -nHAp nanoparticles are effective for targeting to kill cancerous cells, for example, human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells efficiently while they are non-toxic to normal cells. Applying these nanoparticles for drug delivery system, 5-fluorouracil was loaded in the nanoparticles and studied its release kinetics. In the case of Ag + /Fe 2+ co-doped nHAp samples, a pulsatile drug release profile was observed, which the drug was released for about a week on varying the Ag + and Fe 2+ concentrations. The 5-fluorouracil release kinetics was well fitted by the first-order model with diffusion. Thus, nHAps co-doped with Ag + /Fe 2+ material have the potential to lag the time on delivering the drug at site-specific could be with an application in biomedicine such as to treat malignant tumor without any bacterial side effect. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Recently, long noncoding RNA have been identified as new gene regulators and prognostic biomarkers in various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The expression and biological roles of LINC00961 have been reported in many human cancers. However, up to date, no study of LINC00961 has been shown in RCC. Currently, we aimed to investigate the function of LINC00961 in RCC progression. Interestingly, we observed that LINC00961 could act as a novel biomarker in predicting the diagnosis of RCC. Then, we found that LINC00961 was greatly downregulated in RCC cell lines (Caki-1, Caki-2, 786-O, A498, and ACHN cells) compared with normal renal cell lines (HK-2 cells). Then, 786-O cells and ACHN cells were infected with LV-LINC00961. As displayed in our current study, LINC00961 overexpression could obviously suppress the proliferation and survival of RCC cells in vitro. In addition, RCC cell apoptosis was greatly induced and cell cycle progression was blocked in G1 phase by upregulation of LINC00961 in 786-O cells and ACHN cells. Subsequently, we found that LV-LINC00961 was able to restrain RCC cell migration and cell invasion capacity. Meanwhile, the messenger RNA and protein expression levels of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated markers Slug and N-cadherin in RCC cell lines were dramatically inhibited by overexpressing LINC00961. Finally, the in vivo experiment was carried out and we observed that LINC00961 could inhibit RCC development through modulating EMT process. Taken these together, it was indicated in our study that LINC00961 was involved in RCC progression through targeting EMT pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway controls fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) regulates cytoplasmic MAPK signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) MAPK. To determine the role of DUSP6 in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, we characterized the intestinal epithelial phenotype of Dusp6 knockout (KO) mice under normal, oncogenic, and proinflammatory conditions. Our results show that loss of Dusp6 increased crypt depth and epithelial cell proliferation without altering colonic architecture. Crypt regeneration capacity was also enhanced, as revealed by ex vivo Dusp6 KO organoid cultures. Additionally, loss of Dusp6 induced goblet cell expansion without affecting enteroendocrine and absorptive cell differentiation. Our data also demonstrate that Dusp6 KO mice were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, as opposed to wild-type mice. In addition, Dusp6 gene deletion markedly enhanced tumor load in Apc Min/+ mice. Decreased DUSP6 expression by RNA interference in HT29 colorectal cancer cells enhanced ERK1/2 activation levels and promoted both anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as well as invasion through Matrigel. Finally, DUSP6 mRNA expression in human colorectal tumors was decreased in advanced stage tumors compared with paired normal tissues. These results demonstrate that DUSP6 phosphatase, by controlling ERK1/2 activation, regulates colonic inflammatory responses, and protects the intestinal epithelium against oncogenic stress. © 2018 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Malignant Brenner tumor (MBTs) is a rare histological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, accounting for <0.05% of all ovarian neoplasms. As such, current evidence on the treatment of MBTs is predominantly limited to case studies and small case series. To add to existing literature, we performed a retrospective review of 10 cases of MBT diagnosed and treated at a single institution between 1999 and 2018. For the 10 cases included in our cohort, the median age was 64 and the median tumor stage was IIa/IIb. All patients underwent either a primary or interval debulking surgery and achieved an R0 resection per classifications set by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). Lymph node dissections were performed on 6 patients and found no evidence of positive nodal disease. 7 patients received platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy and experienced a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 37 months. Recurrent disease was varied in terms of locoregional versus distant spread, and these patients had largely suboptimal responses to salvage chemotherapy with doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and eribulin. Sites of metastatic disease included the liver, lungs, bone, and brain. While there is no consensus for the optimal treatment of this rare disease, MBTs seem to respond well to adjuvant platinum-taxane treatment after complete surgical resection, consistent with the current management approach of other epithelial ovarian cancers. Recurrent disease is considerably more difficult to manage, and clinicians may consider a wider avenue of treatment options to include hormonal, biologic, and radiation therapies. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Common fragile sites (cFSs) represent parts of the normal chromosome structure susceptible to breakage under replication stress. Although only a small number of cFSs have been molecularly characterized, genomic damage of cFS genes appears to be critical for the development of various human diseases. In this study, we fine mapped the location of FRA14B and showed that the fragile region spans 765 kb at 14q23.3, containing the large gephyrin (GPHN) gene. The FRA14B sequence is enriched in perfect A/T &gt;24 stretches and R-loop forming sequences (RLFS), and harbors a large palindromic motif in the core region. FRA14B instability is not only limited to lymphocytes, but also occurs in neuroblastoma and breast epithelial cells. Using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), we examined copy number alteration patterns within FRA14B in a panel of 180 cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Our CGH data and a survey of 1046 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia profiles demonstrate that focal deletions cluster within FRA14B and disrupt the genomic integrity of GPHN in approximately 5% of cancer cells. Moreover, germline CNVs (copy number variants) profiles provided by the Database of Genomic Variants and available literature suggest that germline CNVs and rare pathogenic deletions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders cluster within the core fragile region of GPHN. Overall, our data provide insight into the molecular structure of FRA14B, and identify GPHN, as a large cFS gene in the human genome, whose disruption appears to trigger various neurodevelopmental diseases. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer cells are considered to have high morphological heterogeneity in human melanoma tissue. Here, we report that epithelial cancer cells are dominant in different development stages of human melanoma tissues. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that maintain melanoma cells in the epithelial state are further investigated in the A2058 cell line. We find that micropore (8 µm) transwell invasion, but not superficial migration in the scratch assay, can induce remarkable morphological changes between epithelial and mesenchymal melanoma cells within 4 days. The morphological switch is associated with dynamic changes of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) hallmarks E-cadherin and vimentin. Further immunoflurencent staining and co-immunoprecipitation assay showed the uncoupling of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in epithelial melanoma cells. Specific knockdown of M3 mAChR by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly abrogates the transition of spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells to epithelial cells. Collectively, we report a cellular model of invasiveness-triggered state transition (ITST) in which melanoma cell invasion can induce morphological changes between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. ITST is one of the biological basis for maintaining metastatic melanoma cells in the epithelial state. Furthermore, M3 mAChR receptor-mediated ITST provides a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit the development of malignant melanoma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The serine/threonine kinase, CHK2 (checkpoint kinase 2), is a key mediator in DNA damage response and a tumor suppressor, which is implicated in promoting cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA repair. Accumulating evidence suggests that these functions are primarily exerted through phosphorylation downstream factors such as p53 and BRCA1. Recent studies have shown that ubiquitination is an important mode of regulation of CHK2. However, it remains largely unclear whether deubiquitinases participate in regulation of CHK2. Here, we report that a deubiquitinase, USP39, is a new regulator of CHK2. Mechanistically, USP39 deubiquitinates and stabilizes CHK2, which in turn enhances CHK2 stability. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated knockdown of USP39 led to deregulate CHK2, which resulted in compromising the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint, decreasing apoptosis, and conferring cancer cells resistance to chemotherapy drugs and radiation treatment. Collectively, we identify USP39 as a novel regulator of CHK2 in the DNA damage response. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background/purpose: In-vivo-accuracy analysis (IVA) of dose-delivery with active motion-management (gating/tracking) was performed based on registration of post-radiotherapeutic MRI-morphologic-alterations (MMA) to the corresponding dose-distributions of gantry-based/robotic SBRT-plans. Methods: Forty targets in two patient cohorts were evaluated: (1) gantry-based SBRT (deep-inspiratory breath-hold-gating; GS) and (2) robotic SBRT (online fiducial-tracking; RS). The planning-CT was deformably registered to the first post-treatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. An isodose-structure cropped to the liver (ISL) and corresponding to the contoured MMA was created. Structure and statistical analysis regarding volumes, surface-distance, conformity metrics and center-of-mass-differences (CoMD) was performed. Results: Liver volume-reduction was −43.1 ± 148.2 cc post-RS and −55.8 ± 174.3 cc post-GS. The mean surface-distance between MMA and ISL was 2.3 ± 0.8 mm (RS) and 2.8 ± 1.1 mm (GS). ISL and MMA volumes diverged by 5.1 ± 23.3 cc (RS) and 16.5 ± 34.1 cc (GS); the median conformity index of both structures was 0.83 (RS) and 0.80 (GS). The average relative directional errors were ≤0.7 mm (RS) and ≤0.3 mm (GS); the median absolute 3D-CoMD was 3.8 mm (RS) and 4.2 mm (GS) without statistically significant differences between the two techniques. Factors influencing the IVA included GTV and PTV (p = 0.041 and p = 0.020). Four local relapses occurred without correlation to IVA. Conclusions: For the first time a method for IVA was presented, which can serve as a benchmarking-tool for other treatment techniques. Both techniques have shown median deviations <5 mm of planned dose and MMA. However, IVA also revealed treatments with errors ≥5 mm, suggesting a necessity for patient-specific safety-margins. Nevertheless, the treatment accuracy of well-performed active motion-compensated liver SBRT seems not to be a driving factor for local treatment failure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effects of PSMA7 silencing on cervical cancer (CC) cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CC tissues (n = 43) and normal tissues (n = 27) were first collected from patients. Human CC cell line (SiHa) and human normal cervical epithelial cells (H8) were obtained and classified into the normal, blank, negative control (NC), PSMA7-shRNA1, and PSMA7-shRNA2 groups, respectively. In situ hybridization was used to detect the expressions of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins. Immunofluorescence assay was carried out to test the activity of 20S proteasomes. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were both performed to determine the expressions of PSMA7, ubiquitin, P27, P53, and VEGF in sample tissues and cells. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to analyze cell proliferation rates, and flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and the apoptotic rate. Compared with normal tissues, CC tissues showed increased expression levels of PSMA7, ubiquitin, p53, VEGF as well as increased activity of 20S proteasomes but exhibited a decrease in p27 expression. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the PSMA7-shRNA1 and PSMA7-shRNA2 groups all had decreased expression levels of PSMA7, ubiquitin, p53, and VEGF as well as decreased cell proliferation, 20S proteasomes activity, and cell number in the S phase, increased p27 expression, cell apoptosis and cell number in the G0/G1 phase. Our study demonstrated that PSMA7 silencing can suppress CC cell proliferation and VEGF expression in addition to promoting cell apoptosis through inhibiting the UPP signaling pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A series of thirteen new aryl/hetarylbichalcophene-5-carboxamidines was prepared and screened for an in vitro anti-proliferative activity against sixty cancer cell lines. The tested monocationic bichalcophenes displayed promising potent anticancer activity against most cancer cell lines with GI 50 values of 1.34–3.09 μM. The most potent compound was derivative 8 (median GI 50 and TGI values of 1.34 and 3.23 μM, respectively), being also the least cytotoxic in this bichalcophene series with an LC 50 of 77.6 μM. The most responsive cancer cell lines were leukemia (SR and K-562) and colon (HCT-15 and HT29) with GI 50 in the sub-micromolar range. The effect of the tested bichalcophenes on normal human lung fibroblast (WI-38) cell line showed that they exerted their antiproliferative activity outside the realms of causing any toxicity in normal cells. To study apoptotic profiles of representatives of this class, compounds 4h, 4i, and 8 were found to cause significant reductions in cdk1 expression in HCT-116 colon cells by 46, 79, and 84%, respectively versus 52% reduction by 5- Flourouracil (5-FU). These three compounds were also unique being the only derivatives that significantly elevated the expression of p53 by ∼2, 4, and 5 folds, respectively. The tested bichalcophenes exhibited moderate to potent antioxidant activity in DPPH and ABTS as well as hydroxyl radical scavenging assays. Moreover, compounds IIIb, IIIc, 4c, and 4i, showed the highest pro-oxidant activity. Finally, to aid future endeavors for optimization of this series, a 5 descriptor 2D-QSAR model was derived from the common physicochemical parameters of these bichalcophenes and the external validation proved the model's good predictive efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) remains a major obstacle to treat colorectal cancer (CRC). Increasing evidences have suggested that bufadienolides contain several fractions displaying antitumor activity and may be applied in lymphatic chemotherapy. However, effects of the highly efficient and lowly toxic (HELT) bufadienolides on CRC in lymphatic chemotherapy have not been reported. Methods: Adenosine triphosphate tumor chemosensitivity assays (ATP-TCA) was performed to detect the inhibition rate (IR) of fractions of bufadienolides to cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells and tumor cells. HELT fraction-loaded emulsions of different concentrations were prepared. Nude mouse bearing HCT116 tumors in footpad received high-dose emulsion (HD-E), middle-dose emulsion (MD-E), low-dose emulsion (LD-E), control emulsion (CE), Cinobufacini Injection (CI), or normal saline (NS), respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Flow Cytometry (FCM), enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) and hematological examination were applied to evaluate therapeutic effects and potential toxicity. Results: F18 and F19 were screened out as HELT fractions in vivo and F18-loaded emulsions of different concentrations for lymphatic administration were prepared. We confirmed that HD-E and MD-E produced obvious antitumor activities in footpad tumors and LNM compared with other groups in vitro. We also verified the effects of F18-loaded emulsions on activating hematopoietic function, stimulating proliferation of the spleen and natural killer (NK) cells, and promoting the secretion of IFN-γ and IgG1, although HD-E performed mild toxicity on liver. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that lymphatic chemotherapy with HELT fraction of bufadienolides could be an effective approach to the treatment of CRC patients with LNM. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The nucleolus is a subnuclear compartment, which governs ribosome biogenesis. Moreover, it functions as hub in the stress response by orchestrating a variety of processes, such as regulation of cell cycle progression, senescence and apoptosis. Emerging evidence links the nucleolus also to the control of genomic stability and the development of human malignancies. Peter Pan (PPAN) is an essential ribosome biogenesis factor localized to nucleoli and mitochondria. We earlier showed that PPAN depletion triggers p53-independent nucleolar stress and apoptosis. In this study we investigated the precise localization of nucleolar PPAN during cell cycle and its function in cell cycle regulation. We show that PPAN knockdown impairs cell proliferation and induces G0/G1 as well as later G2/M cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. Although PPAN knockdown stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and induces CDKN1A/p21, the proliferation defects occur largely in a p53/p21-independent manner. We noticed a reduced number of knockdown cells entering cytokinesis and an elevation of binucleation. PPAN knockdown is also associated with increased H2A.X phosphorylation (γH2A.X) in cancer cells. We evaluated a potential signaling axis through the DNA damage response kinases ATM and ATR and alternatively apoptosis as a potent driver of γH2A.X. Interestingly, PPAN knockdown does not involve activation of ATM/ATR. Instead, γH2A.X is generated as a consequence of apoptosis induction in cancer cells. Strikingly, PPAN depletion in human fibroblasts did neither provoke apoptosis nor H2A.X phosphorylation, but recapitulated p53 stabilization. In summary, our data underline the notion that the PPAN-mediated, p53-independent nucleolar stress response has multiple facets. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are standard treatments for chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CN-mCRPC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these medications in elderly (≥ 75 years old) compared with young CN-mCRPC patients in a real-world clinical setting. Secondarily, we explored the survival prognostic value of different anatomo-clinical factors in elderly group. Methods: In this retrospective observational multicentre study, we included 134 consecutive CN-mCRPC patients, 64 young and 70 elderly men, who had received AA or Enz. Results: We did not find significant differences in treatment duration [16.6 months, (95% CI 9–24.2 months) vs. 16.8 months (95% CI: 6.3–27.2 months); p = 0.926] and overall survival [median not reached vs. 23.3 months (95% CI 10.2–36.3 months); p = 0.131] between the young and elderly groups. In elderly group, the only predictors of overall survival with AA or Enz were good ECOG performance status and high G8 score. Adverse events of grade ≥3 was similar in elderly group (12.9%) and in the young group (15.6%). Treatment was discontinued due to AEs in 6.3% of young group and 18.6% of elderly group. Conclusions: Effectiveness and safety of treatment of CN-mRCPC with Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide were similar in older and younger patients, although treatment discontinuation due to AEs was more frequent in the older age group. In addition to ECOG PS, assessment using specific geriatric scales as G8 screening tool could help to identify patients aged ≥75 who would most benefit from treatment with new-generation hormone therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: SABR is a widely accepted treatment for early-stage lung cancer but there are safety concerns for central and ultra-central tumours. Herein we report our experience using risk-adapted fractionation (prescribed doses: 40–60 Gy in 3–8 fractions) with prioritization of dose to organs at risk. Methods: Patient declining or unsuitable for surgery with primitive or recurrent lung cancer were included. Tumours inside a 2 cm area around proximal bronchial tree (PBT) were classified as central while tumours with PTV overlapping PBT, oesophagus, great vessels and pericardial pleura were classified as ultra-central. We assessed overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC) and toxicities. Results: From 2009 to 2016, 137 patients were treated (median age: 75 years), with 60 central and 77 ultra-central tumours. Median follow-up was 36 months. Median tumour size, GTV and PTV were 2.5 cm (0.9–7), 7.8 cm 3 (0.7–94.2) and 30.6 cm 3 (6.5–274.3), respectively. For the whole population, median OS and DFS were 46 months and 33 months. One- and 2-years LC rates were 95% and 81%. Median OS between central and ultra-central tumours was statistically different with 57 vs 37 months (HR 0.48, p = 0.017), but LC was not different among them. We observed 4 Grade 3 and 6 Grade 5 toxicities (no grade 4). Conclusions: SABR for central and ultra-central tumours is associated with good OS, DFS and LC rates, with 7.3% grade 3–5 toxicities. Central tumours had a better prognosis in our cohort. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Motion management in the treatment of lung cancer is necessary to assure highest quality of the delivered radiation therapy. In this study, the breath-hold technique is experimentally investigated for pencil beam scanned (PBS) proton therapy, with respect to the dosimetric effect of residual breath-hold motion. Material and methods: Three-dimensional (3D)-printed tumours extracted from CT scans of three patients were inserted into a dynamic anthropomorphic breathing phantom. The target was set up to move with the individual patient's tumour motion during breath-hold as previously assessed on fluoroscopy. Target dose was measured with radio-chromic film, and both single field uniform dose (SFUD) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans were delivered. Experiments were repeated for each patient without any motion, to compute the relative dose deviation between static and breath-hold cases. Results: SFUD plans showed small dose deviations between static and breath-hold cases, as evidenced by the gamma pass rate (3%, 3 mm) of 85% or higher. Dose deviation was more evident for IMPT plans, with gamma pass rate reduced to 50–70%. Conclusions: The breath-hold technique is robust to residual intra-breath-hold motion for SFUD treatment plans, based on our experimental study. IMPT was less robust with larger detected dose deviations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
