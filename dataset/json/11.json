    "Abstract": "n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is a potential anti-cancer drug, which can be extracted from Angelica sinensis (Danggui). Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Artemisinin is used as an antimalarial and anticancer agent with minimal toxic effects on the host body. Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the major health issues in the world presently with high tendency of leading to hepatocarcinoma, cirrhosis and liver cancer, especially if not properly managed. It has been estimated that there are about 2 billion people with a serological profile of HBV infection, and 360 million patients worldwide living with chronic HBV-associated liver disease, hence the need to find an efficient and precise diagnosis technique to drive a robust treatment for Hepatitis B virus cannot be over emphasized. The emergence of analytical device like biosensor which combines biological and physicochemical element to detect HBV in screened samples has been very helpful in providing a timely intervention to tame this virus. This review focuses on the current state of biosensor researches with respect to various in-depth application of gold nanoparticle for the detection of HBV. © 2019 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Flotillin-2 (FLOT2) was reported as oncogene and involves in the pathogenic process of several cancers, yet the precise mechanism of FLOT2 in glioma is still limited. In this study, we demonstrated that FLOT2 expression levels were greatly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and the FLOT2 expression in glioma tissue was markedly associated with tumour stage and size. Overexpression of FLOT2 was correlated with poor prognosis of glioma patients. The functional assay revealed that silenced FLOT2 repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. And then, we detected the relationship between miR-449 and FLOT2. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot results showed that miR-449 directly binding the 3′UTR sequence of FLOT2 and regulated FLOT2 expression in glioma cells. Finally, we detected the expression levels of miR-449 in glioma tissue and cell lines and found that miR-449 was significantly downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrated that overexpression FLOT2 was associated with poor prognosis of glioma patients and involved in the progression of glioma, identifying a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma progression. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Chromosome changes are one of the hallmarks of human malignancies. Chromosomal rearrangement is frequent in human cancers. One of the consequences of chromosomal rearrangement is gene fusions in the cancer genome. We have previously identified a panel of fusion genes in aggressive prostate cancers. In this study, we showed that 6 of these fusion genes are present in 7 different types of human malignancies with variable frequencies. Among them, the CCNH-C5orf30 and TRMT11-GRIK2 gene fusions were found in breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer and liver cancer, with frequencies ranging from 12.9% to 85%. In contrast, four other gene fusions (mTOR-TP53BP1, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) are less frequent. Both TRMT11-GRIK2 and CCNH-C5orf30 are also frequently present in lymph node metastatic cancer samples from the breast, colon and ovary. Thus, detecting these fusion transcripts may have significant biological and clinical implications in cancer patient management. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "It is unknown whether the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects the incidence of laryngeal cancer. The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Quantifying the genetic correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Colon cancer is a major health problem worldwide. While chemotherapy remains a main approach for treating late-stage colon cancer patients, most, if not all, of them will develop drug resistance and die of uncontrollable disease progression eventually. Therefore, identification of mechanism of drug resistance and development of overcoming strategy hold great significance in management of colon cancer. In this study, we discovered that activation of the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways is required for colon cancer cells to survive treatment of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), one of the first-line chemotherapeutics for late-stage colon cancer patients. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PERK or its downstream factors greatly sensitize colon cancer cells to 5-FU. Most importantly, in vivo use of PERK inhibitor synergizes with 5-FU in suppressing the growth of colon cancer cells in mouse models. In summary, our findings established a promising way to overcome resistance to chemotherapy in colon cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains dismal despite continuous and considerable efforts. Integrins (ITGs) are highly expressed in various malignant cancers. However, very few studies investigated the role of integrin α3 (ITGα3) in malignant cancers. Here, we determined the functional role of ITGα3 in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of public microarray databases and Western blot analysis indicated a unique expression of ITGα3 in human pancreatic cancer. Silencing ITGα3 expression significantly inhibited the viability and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, ablation of ITGα3 expression resulted in a significant decrease of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression compared with transfection of control-siRNA through an increased number of leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (LRIG1) expression. In addition, ablating ITGα3 inhibited tumour growth via blockade of EGFR signalling in vivo. Furthermore, the highly expressed ITGα3 led to a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Our results provide novel insights into ITGα3-induced aggressive pancreatic cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The discovery of anticancer therapeutics effective in eliminating dormant cells is a significant challenge in cancer biology. Here, we describe new synthetic polymer-based anticancer agents that mimic the mode of action of anticancer peptides. These anticancer polymers developed here are designed to capture the cationic, amphiphilic traits of anticancer peptides. The anticancer polymers are designed to target anionic lipids exposed on the cancer cell surfaces and act by disrupting the cancer cell membranes. Because the polymer mechanism is not dependent on cell proliferation, we hypothesized that the polymers were active against dormant cancer cells. The polymers exhibited cytotoxicity to proliferating prostate cancer. Importantly, the polymer killed dormant prostate cancer cells that were resistant to docetaxel. This study demonstrates a new approach to discover novel anticancer therapeutics. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The causes of occupational diseases are changing, thats why a regular update of Czech List of Occupational Diseases is needed. New compensable occupational diseases, such as cancer of the larynx and ovarian cancer due to asbestos, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases due to black coal dust were included in the last two updates of the Czech List. The need of an early examination at the Centers of Occupational Diseases is stressed in this article, especially before a surgery or other treatment of epicondylitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. These treatments may suppress the diagnostic hallmarks requested for acknowledgements of these disorders. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis, allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma are underdiagnosed, and isocyanates belong among the key factors. Only about 10 % patients with mesotheliomas due to asbestos are compensated. The latency in cancers due to asbestos may reach more than 50 years.

    "Abstract": "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for many cancers including breast, esophageal, colon, and thyroid cancer. We aimed to evaluate the association of thyroid cancer with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and weight change. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 11,323,006 adults who joined the national health screening program. Weight change was defined as the difference between the weight of the subjects measured during the study period and the weight at the time of four years ago. For evaluating the association between the weight change and the risk of thyroid cancer, subjects without weight change for four years were defined as the reference group. Mean age was 50.1 ± 13.7 years and 44% were female. In total, 50,464 subjects (0.4%) had newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer. After multivariable analyses, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased significantly in subjects with larger WC as well as higher BMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In subjects who were lean and became obese, the incidence of thyroid cancers increased significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.11–1.19]). In subjects who were obese and became lean, the incidence of thyroid cancers decreased significantly (HR 0.89 [0.86–0.93]). These results demonstrated that higher BMI and larger WC were significantly associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Weight gain in lean subjects was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, and weight reduction in subjects with obesity was associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A quantitative technique to detect cancer in single cells could transform cancer diagnosis. Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is known to result from a combination of a small number of genetic defects. However, the specific combinations of mutations responsible for the vast majority of cancers have not been identified. Current computational approaches focus on identifying driver genes and mutations. Although individually these mutations can increase the risk of cancer they do not result in cancer without additional mutations. We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types. We then present an approach based on mutational profile that can be used to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations within these genes. These combinations, with experimental validation, can aid in better diagnosis, provide insights into the etiology of cancer, and provide a rational basis for designing targeted combination therapies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A growing emphasis in anticancer drug discovery efforts has been on targeting histone acetylation modulators. Here we comprehensively analyze the genomic alterations of the genes encoding histone acetylation modulator proteins (HAMPs) in the Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and observe that HAMPs have a high frequency of focal copy number alterations and recurrent mutations, whereas transcript fusions of HAMPs are relatively rare genomic events in common adult cancers. Collectively, 86.3% (63/73) of HAMPs have recurrent alterations in at least 1 cancer type and 16 HAMPs, including 9 understudied HAMPs, are identified as putative therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types. For example, the recurrent focal amplification of BRD9 is observed in 9 cancer types and genetic depletion of BRD9 inhibits tumor growth. Our systematic genomic analysis of HAMPs across a large-scale cancer specimen cohort may facilitate the identification and prioritization of potential drug targets and selection of suitable patients for precision treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Solid stress is a biomechanical abnormality of the tumor microenvironment that plays a crucial role in tumor progression. When it is applied to cancer cells, solid stress hinders their proliferation rate and promotes cancer cell invasion and metastatic potential. However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration. Our results suggest a novel solid stress signal transduction mechanism bringing GDF15 to the centre of pancreatic tumor biology and rendering it a potential target for future anti-metastatic therapeutic innovations. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumour sequencing identifies highly recurrent point mutations in cancer driver genes, but rare functional mutations are hard to distinguish from large numbers of passengers. We developed a novel computational platform applying a multi-modal approach to filter out passengers and more robustly identify putative driver genes. The primary filter identifies enrichment of cancer mutations in CATH functional families (CATH-FunFams) – structurally and functionally coherent sets of evolutionary related domains. Using structural representatives from CATH-FunFams, we subsequently seek enrichment of mutations in 3D and show that these mutation clusters have a very significant tendency to lie close to known functional sites or conserved sites predicted using CATH-FunFams. Our third filter identifies enrichment of putative driver genes in functionally coherent protein network modules confirmed by literature analysis to be cancer associated. Our approach is complementary to other domain enrichment approaches exploiting Pfam families, but benefits from more functionally coherent groupings of domains. Using a set of mutations from 22 cancers we detect 151 putative cancer drivers, of which 79 are not listed in cancer resources and include recently validated cancer associated genes EPHA7, DCC netrin-1 receptor and zinc-finger protein ZNF479. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Our purpose is to identify cancer patients at highest risk of suicide compared to the general population and other cancer patients. This is a retrospective, population-based study using nationally representative data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, 1973-2014. Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male (83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin lymphoma had the highest SMRs (> 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white, unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

We investigated whether dietary lutein/zeaxanthin intake affects colorectal cancer risk in patients with a DICER1 rs3742330 polymorphism. In this hospital-based case-control study, we recruited 923 colorectal cancer patients and 1,846 controls based on eligibility criteria, a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and the DICER1 rs3742330 genotype. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusted for confounders. The highest quartile of lutein/zeaxanthin consumption was inversely associated with a reduced colorectal cancer risk (OR, 95% CI = 0.25, 0.18–0.36). Carrying G allele (AG + GG) showed a significantly reduced colorectal cancer incidence compared with that of AA carriers (OR, 95% CI = 0.71, 0.55–0.91). Those carrying the G allele (AG + GG) along with high lutein/zeaxanthin consumption were markedly associated with a decreased colorectal cancer risk (OR, 95% CI = 0.32, 0.22–0.46, P for interaction = 0.018), particularly for rectal cancer (OR, 95% CI = 0.24, 0.15–0.39, P for interaction = 0.004), compared with that of AA carriers with low lutein/zeaxanthin intakes. In conclusion, colorectal cancer risk was related to an interactive effect between dietary lutein/zeaxanthin intake and the DICER1 rs3742330 polymorphism. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The UHRF1-DNMT1 axis plays a key role in DNA maintenance methylation in mammals. Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The importance of body size versus weight distribution for cancer risk is unclear. We investigated associations between measures of body size and shape and the risk of developing cancer. The study population consisted of 26,607 participants from the Alberta’s Tomorrow Project cohort. Two main measures of body shape and size were examined: i) body mass index (BMI) and ii) waist circumference (WC). Incident cancers were identified via linkage to the Alberta Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m −2 ) have a 33% and 22% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines. Mutual adjustment for WC attenuates the association between BMI and all-cancer risk, especially among females. Central adiposity appears to be a stronger predictor of all-cancer risk than body size. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth with the ability to penetrate or develop to the other parts of the body. Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Chromobox 6 (CBX6) is a subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that mediates epigenetic gene repression and acts as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in a cancer type-dependent manner. The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We reported on the ability of immortalized or oncosuppressor-mutated cells (OMCs) to uptake circulating cancer-factors and give tumors when transplanted into mice. This led to the first biological based liquid biopsy test, which we called MATER-D platform. In the present study, we showed for the first time that a different type of OMCs (PTEN-deficient human epithelial MCF10A cells) turn malignant when exposed to cancer patient’s sera, confirming the concept that different cells with diverse oncosuppressor mutations can uptake cancer factors and be used in biological based liquid biopsy tests. Our observations were confirmed in a large variety of solid and haematological malignancies. This test was able to detect dysplasia and carcinomas in situ lesions in different organs and circulating factors in cancer patients years after the removal of their lesions. To our knowledge, this ability is unique and not shared by other liquid biopsy platforms. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the xenotransplants revealed identical patterns of differentiation regardless of the cancer type, showing that differentiation through horizontal transfer might be dependent on the nature of the target cells rather than the type of cancer factors. These data strengthen the notion that OMC-based liquid biopsy tests might be promising platforms for cancer screening. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that make use of the cancer-specific accumulation of porphyrins. We have reported that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitROS) upregulate uptake transporter of porphyrins, heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1). The accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins was increased by mitROS production, thereby the cancer-specific PDT cytotoxicity was enhanced. Thus we investigated whether mitROS production by hyperthermia can enhanced the cytotoxicity of PDT or not. In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies showed that changes to the gut microbiome alters the microbiome-derived metabolome, potentially promoting carcinogenesis in organs that are distal to the gut. In this study, we assessed the relationship between breast cancer and cadaverine biosynthesis. Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients. Taken together, cadaverine production seems to be a regulator of early breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite the development of treatment options in breast cancer, many patients die of recurrence and metastasis. Owing to enhanced permeability and retention in solid tumor tissue, nanoparticle (NP) delivery systems have been emerged as novel strategy in cancer chemotherapy. As extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) could bind its surface receptor adhesion molecule CD44 which is strongly expressed on breast cancer. We have previously reported a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HA-Lys-LA X-NPs (X-NP-DOX) NP delivery system for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Owing to its enhanced efficacy and higher targetability compared to free DOX, low-dose DOX delivered by NP system may be a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women. Although cure rates are high for early stage disease, clinical outcomes for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease remain poor. To change this panorama, a deeper understanding of cervical cancer biology and novel study models are needed. Immortalized human cancer cell lines such as HeLa constitute crucial scientific tools, but there are few other cervical cancer cell lines available, limiting our understanding of a disease known for its molecular heterogeneity. This study aimed to establish novel cervical cancer cell lines derived from Brazilian patients. We successfully established one (HCB-514) out of 35 cervical tumors biopsied. We confirmed the phenotype of HCB-514 by verifying its’ epithelial and tumor origin through cytokeratins, EpCAM and p16 staining. It was also HPV-16 positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1 and IRX2. A copy number variation (CNV) analysis by nanostring and WES revealed amplification of genes mainly related to kinases proteins involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and validated by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the HCB-514 cell line was sensitive to cisplatin. In summary, this novel Brazilian cervical cancer cell line exhibits relevant key molecular features and constitutes a new biological model for pre-clinical studies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common diagnosed cancer globally. Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice. These findings indicate that targeting colon cancer cells by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing cell survival mechanisms may suppose a therapeutic option in colon cancer through the combination of rosemary compounds and chemotherapeutic drugs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Systemic inflammation has been associated with aggressive tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of 26 kinds of inflammatory cytokine expression patterns among 185 patients with breast cancer and 54 healthy volunteers followed by chemometric analysis. We identified the specific cytokine expression patterns of breast cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers with (1) VEGF, IL-9, GM-CSF, IL-13, IL-4, and IFNγ, (2) IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-5, IL-7, IL-1α, GCSF, IL-1β, and TNFα and (3) IL-2, Eotaxin, MIP1β, MIP1α, IL-17, and bFGF. Among the patients with breast cancer, we identified the specific cytokine signature of metastatic patients compared to non-metastatic patients. We also established a mathematical model for distinguishing patients with breast cancer from healthy volunteers and metastatic patients from non-metastatic patients. This cytokine network analysis could provide new insights into early intervention and effective therapeutic strategy for patients with breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) promotes cancer development but also impedes tumor growth by activating anti-cancer barriers. To determine how cancer cells adapt to RS, we have monitored the expression of different components of the ATR-CHK1 pathway in primary tumor samples. We show that unlike upstream components of the pathway, the checkpoint mediators Claspin and Timeless are overexpressed in a coordinated manner. Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that enhanced levels of Claspin and Timeless represent a gain of function that protects cancer cells from of oncogene-induced RS in a checkpoint-independent manner. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A single outcome in a biological procedure at the time of cancer therapy is due to multiple changes happening simultaneously. Hence to mimic such complex biological processes, an understanding of stimuli responsiveness is needed to sense specific changes and respond in a predictable manner. Such responses due to polymers may take place either simultaneously at the site or in a sequential manner from preparation to transporting pathways to cellular compartments. The present review comprehends the stimuli-responsive polymers and multi-responsiveness with respect to cancer therapy. It focuses on the exploitation of different stimuli like temperature, pH and enzymes responsiveness in a multi-stimuli setting. Nanogels and micelles being two of the most commonly used responsive polymeric carriers have also been discussed. The role of multiple stimuli delivery system is significant due to multiple changes happening in the near surroundings of cancer cells. These responsive materials are able to mimic some biological processes and recognize at the molecular level itself to manipulate development of custom-designed molecules for targeting cancer cells.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of our observational prospective study was to investigate the severity and prevalence of urinary and pelvic floor disorders in gynecologic cancer survivors. All patients surviving gynecological cancer in the region as well as women receiving invitations to attend breast-screening checkups as the control population were asked to fill-in questionnaires assessing pelvic prolapse symptoms (PFDI-20, Wexner) and associated quality of life (PFIQ-7). Eighty-nine women were included in the cancer survivor group and 1088 in the control group. Pelvic floor symptoms (PFDI-20 questionnaire) were significantly worse in cancer survivors than in control women (score: 33.3 [14.6–74.1] vs. 20 [4.2–50.0], p = 0.0003). Urge incontinence was significantly worse in cancer survivors in both univariable (ORb = 2.061 [95% CI = 1.284–3.309], p = 0.0027) and multivariable analyses (ORa = 1.672 [95% CI = 1.014–2.758], p = 0.0442), as was fecal incontinence in univariable (ORb = 3.836 [95% CI = 1.710–8.602], p = 0.0011) and in multivariable (ORa = 3.862 [95% CI = 1.657–9.001], p = 0.0018) analyses. Women with benign hysterectomies had poorer quality of life and increased pelvic floor disorders compared to women with no history of surgery. Survivors of gynecological cancer experience significantly more pelvic floor symptoms and an associated reduction in quality of life. © 2019, The Author(s).",

Our study investigated the presence of BLV genome in healthy (n = 72) and cancerous (n = 72) paraffin-embedded samples of breast tissues from women in south Brazil. BLV DNA was found most frequently (30.5%) in breast cancer tissue than in healthy breast (13.9%) (Odds ratio = 2.73; confidence interval = 1.18–6.29; p = 0.027). In contrast, antibodies to BLV were found in a very small percentage of healthy blood donors. There was no association between BLV DNA and other tumor prognostic biological markers such as hormonal receptors, HER2 oncoprotein, proliferation index, metastasis in sentinels lymph nodes, and tumor grade and size. Our findings suggest that BLV should be considered a potential predisposing factor to breast cancer in women. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Copy number loss of PIK3R1 (p85α) most commonly occurs in ovarian cancer among all cancer types. Here we report that ovarian cancer cells manifest a spectrum of tumorigenic phenotypes upon knockdown of PIK3R1. PIK3R1 loss activates AKT and p110-independent JAK2/STAT3 signaling through inducing changes in the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab2, thereby relieving the negative inhibition on AKT and promoting the assembly of JAK2/STAT3 signalosome, respectively. Additional mechanisms leading to AKT activation include enhanced p110α kinase activity and a decrease in PTEN level. PIK3R1 loss renders ovarian cancer cells vulnerable to inhibition of AKT or JAK2/STAT3. The combination of AKT and STAT3 inhibitors significantly increases the anti-tumor effect compared to single-agent treatments. Together, our findings provide a rationale for mechanism-based therapeutic approach that targets tumors with loss of PIK3R1. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancers in the bone produce a number of severe symptoms including pain that compromises patient functional status, quality of life, and survival. The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. RNAseq was performed on a representative clone to comprehensively examine the transcriptional cellular signature in response to xCT knockdown, identifying multiple differentially regulated factors relevant to cancer pain including nerve growth factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating factor-1. Mice were inoculated intrafemorally and recordings of pain-related behaviors including weight bearing, mechanical withdrawal, and limb use were performed. Animals implanted with xCT knockdown cancer cells displayed a delay until the onset of nociceptive behaviors relative to control cells. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that a reduction in glutamate release from cancers in bone by inhibition of the system x C − transporter may decrease the severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases. © The Author(s) 2019.",

    "Abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising therapies for haematological cancers. Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we aimed to identify mutations of key genes associated with docetaxel resistance in nine endometrial cancer cell lines. Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment. The molecular mechanism involves truncation of the 403 amino acid PTEN protein at amino acid 68 by the Y68 frame shift, leading to the loss of PTEN protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Turmeric, since in ancient Indian traditional medicinal system, has been implicated for its therapeutic and chemopreventive properties against a broad spectrum of diseases. Curcumin, the active polyphenol from turmeric, helps to obstruct the growth of many types of cancers at various stages which include prostrate, melanoma, breast, brain tumor, pancreatic, leukemia, etc. The initiation and recurrence of cancer have been attributed to few mutated cells in bulk of tumor called as cancer stem cells which have the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3B) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase, originally found in mammals, an important component of diverse signaling pathways, dysregulation of which leads to affect the cancer stem cell properties. The nutritional- and phytochemical-based dietary interventions may complement current chemotherapy to prevent recurrence and relapse of cancer. The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of retinoic acid and curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates against GSK-3B protein. The in silico results indicate that molecule 3 (curcumin–retinoic acid conjugates) might be a potent inhibitor of GSK-3B and a novel future drug candidate for the treatment of cancer. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "DNA replication timing is known to facilitate the establishment of the epigenome, however, the intimate connection between replication timing and changes to the genome and epigenome in cancer remain largely uncharacterised. Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. A subset of altered replication timing domains are conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Notably, late-replicating regions in cancer cells display a loss of DNA methylation, and a switch in heterochromatin features from H3K9me3-marked constitutive to H3K27me3-marked facultative heterochromatin. Finally, analysis of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating regions are prone to cis and early-replication to trans chromosomal rearrangements. Together, our data suggests that the nature of chromosomal rearrangement in cancer is related to the spatial and temporal positioning and altered epigenetic states of early-replicating compared to late-replicating loci. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have vastly expanded our view of RNA world in intracellular signal regulating networks. Here, we functionally characterized a normally highly expressed miRNA, miR-30a-5p (MIMAT0000087), which exhibits downregulated expression profiles in prostate cancer samples. MiR-30a-5p knockdown and overexpression in PC-3 cell line alters cell proliferation supporting a tumour suppressor role. We also discovered that PCLAF is the direct target of miR-30a-5p. Notably, PC-3 cell proliferation is inhibited by miR-30a-5p/PCLAF axis. miR-30a-5p represents a novel molecule of functionally important miRNAs which may shed light on the novel therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts has been considered a good index that reflects the local immune response and systemic inflammation. However, the use of the SII has not been reported in cervical cancer. In this study, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that a high SII was associated with poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients in the primary and validation cohorts. A higher SII had a significant correlation with larger tumours but had no correlation with other clinicopathological parameters. Among all systemic immune indexes, the SII is the only independent prognostic factor for cervical cancer patients. Compared with the area under the curve for the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR), the area for the SII was larger at 3 and 5 years. In addition, the SII still retains it prognostic values across all FIGO stages. The SII can independently predict the overall survival of patients with cervical cancer receiving radical resection and is thus superior to existing systemic inflammatory indexes. The prognostic nomogram based on the SII is a reliable model for predicting the postoperative survival of patients with cervical cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Increased Crabp2 levels have been found in various types of cancer, and are associated with poor patients’ survival. Although Crabp2 is found to be overexpressed in lung cancer, its role in metastasis of lung cancer is unclear. In this study, Crabp2 was overexpressed in high-metastatic C10F4 than low-metastatic lung cancer cells. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that high CRABP2 levels were correlated with lymph node metastases, poor overall survival, and increased recurrence. Knockdown of Crabp2 decreased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and in vivo metastasis. Crabp2 was co-immunoprecipitated with HuR, and overexpression of Crabp2 increased HuR levels, which promoted integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling. Inhibition of HuR or integrin β1/FAK/ERK signaling reversed the promoting effect of Crabp2 in migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Knockdown of Crabp2 further inhibited the growth of cancer cells as compared with that by gemcitabine or irinotecan alone. The expression of Crabp2 in human lung tumors was correlated with stress marker CHOP. In conclusion, our findings have identified the promoting role of Crabp2 in anoikis resistance and metastasis. CRABP2 may serve as a prognostic marker and targeting CRABP2 may be exploited as a modality to reduce metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer cell lines (CCL) are an integral part of modern cancer research but are susceptible to misidentification. The increasing popularity of sequencing technologies motivates the in-silico identification of CCLs based on their mutational fingerprint, but care must be taken when identifying heterogeneous data. We recently developed the proof-of-concept Uniquorn 1 method which could reliably identify heterogeneous sequencing data from selected sequencing technologies. Here we present Uniquorn 2, a generic and robust in-silico identification method for CCLs with DNA/RNA-seq and panel-seq information. We benchmarked Uniquorn 2 by cross-identifying 1612 RNA and 3596 panel-sized NGS profiles derived from 1516 CCLs, five repositories, four technologies and three major cancer panel-designs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 96% for RNA-seq and 95% for mixed DNA-seq and RNA-seq identification. Even for a panel of only 94 cancer-related genes, accuracy remains at 82% but decreases when using smaller panels. Uniquorn 2 is freely available as R-Bioconductor-package ‘Uniquorn’. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer diagnosis currently relies on histological detection of endoluminal neoplasia in biopsy specimens. However, clinical visual endoscopy provides no quantitative subsurface cancer information. In this ex vivo study of nine fresh human colon specimens, we report the first use of quantified subsurface scattering coefficient maps acquired by swept-source optical coherence tomography to reveal subsurface abnormities. We generate subsurface scattering coefficient maps with a novel wavelet-based-curve-fitting method that provides significantly improved accuracy. The angular spectra of scattering coefficient maps of normal tissues exhibit a spatial feature distinct from those of abnormal tissues. An angular spectrum index to quantify the differences between the normal and abnormal tissues is derived, and its strength in revealing subsurface cancer in ex vivo samples is statistically analyzed. The study demonstrates that the angular spectrum of the scattering coefficient map can effectively reveal subsurface colorectal cancer and potentially provide a fast and more accurate diagnosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We are increasingly accumulating molecular data about a cell. The challenge is how to integrate them within a unified conceptual and computational framework enabling new discoveries. Hence, we propose a novel, data-driven concept of an integrated cell, iCell. Also, we introduce a computational prototype of an iCell, which integrates three omics, tissue-specific molecular interaction network types. We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes. Our methodology is universal and enables integrative comparisons of diverse omics data over cells and tissues. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "CD47 is a prominent new target in cancer immunotherapy, with antagonistic antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. For effective evaluation of this strategy it is crucial to identify which patients are suited for CD47-targeted therapy. In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy. Moreover, SLAMF7 also does not impact on phagocytosis induction by CD20 antibody rituximab nor associates with overall survival of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients. In contrast, expression of CD47 negatively impacts on overall and progression free survival. In conclusion, cancer cell expression of SLAMF7 is not required for phagocytosis and, in contrast to CD47 expression, should not be used as selection criterion for CD47-targeted therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2019, The Author(s).",

The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin. It is concluded that SPG-56 may have potential as a novel anti-tumor candidate for breast cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Urine samples provide a potential alternative to physician-taken or self-collected cervical samples for cervical screening. Screening by primary hrHPV testing requires additional risk assessment (so-called triage) of hrHPV-positive women. Molecular markers, such as DNA methylation, have proven most valuable for triage when applied to cervical specimens. This study was set out to compare hrHPV and DNA methylation results in paired urine and cervical scrapes, and to evaluate the feasibility of DNA methylation analysis in urine to detect cervical cancer. Urine samples (n = 41; native and sediment) and paired cervical scrapes (n = 38) from cervical cancer patients, and urine from 44 female controls, were tested for hrHPV and 6 methylation markers. Results on native urine and sediment were highly comparable. A strong agreement was found between hrHPV testing on urine and scrapes (kappa = 0.79). Also, methylation levels in urine were moderately to strongly correlated to those detected in scrapes (r = 0.508–0.717). All markers were significantly increased in urine from cervical cancer patients compared to controls and showed a good discriminatory power for cervical cancer (AUC = 0.744–0.887). Our results show a good agreement of urine-based molecular analysis with reference cervical samples, and suggest that urine-based DNA methylation testing may provide a promising strategy for cervical cancer detection. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Combinational therapy is usually considered as a preferable approach for effective cancer therapy. Especially, combinational chemo and photothermal therapy is of particular interest due to its high flexibility as well as efficiency. In this article, we the silica nanoparticles (SLN) were surface conjugated with Cetuximab (Cet-SLN) to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a common receptor that usually observed to overexpress in multiple breast cancers. Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Infection caused by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are implicated in the aetiology of cervical cancer. Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cachexia is a wasting syndrome associated with high mortality in cancer patients through inducing the failure of normal metabolism and reducing the efficacy of cancer treatment. Thus, it is critically important to diagnose cancer cachexia early. To provide background data for the diagnosis of cachexia, cancer cachectic factors were characterized in the present situation, including immunological cachectic changes during cachexia progression in a cancer cachexia mouse model. Major constitution of cachexia progression is known as the stages of pre-cachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia. In the pre-cachexia stage, the weights of immune-related organs, including the thymus and spleen were significantly. T cell populations in spleen were markedly reduced and cachectic cytokines consistently increased in a time-dependent manner. Immunosuppression by activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 was induced earlier in CD4 + cells versus other T cell populations. Furthermore, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-6 levels in the cachexia group were significantly increased at 3 days from C26 cell inoculation whereas significant carcass weight loss as a classical diagnostic marker occurred at 9 days from C26 cell inoculation. In conclusion, the initiation of cachectic immunological changes was observed prior to weight loss, during the pre-cachexia stage. Accordingly, these findings reveal that the monitoring of humoral and immunological factors may be more sensitive than weight loss for the initial diagnosis and treatment of cachexia. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The integration of genomic and DNA methylation data has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy in understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis. These results have demonstrated that the integrative analysis using the expanded methylation data is powerful in identifying critical genes/pathways that may serve as new therapeutic targets. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, exerts beneficial effects in cancer patients. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood, normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles, cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The favourable kinetics of 18 F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) permits to depict cancer glucose consumption by a single evaluation of late tracer uptake. This standard procedure relies on the slow radioactivity loss, usually attributed to the limited tumour expression of G6P-phosphatase (G6Pase). However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells. Our data show that accounting for tracer access to the ER configures this compartment as the preferential site of FDG accumulation. This is confirmed by the reticular localization of fluorescent FDG analogues. Remarkably enough, reticular accumulation rate of FDG is dependent upon extracellular glucose availability, thus configuring the same ER as a significant determinant of cancer glucose metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer detected in women and current screening methods for the disease are not sensitive. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include endogenous metabolites that provide information about health and disease which might be useful to develop a better screening method for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to classify mice with and without tumors and compare tumors localized to the mammary pad and tumor cells injected into the iliac artery by differences in VOCs in urine. After 4T1.2 tumor cells were injected into BALB/c mice either in the mammary pad or into the iliac artery, urine was collected, VOCs from urine headspace were concentrated by solid phase microextraction and results were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were employed to find potential biomarkers for breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer in mice models. A set of six VOCs classified mice with and without tumors with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.85, 1.00]) via five-fold cross validation. Classification of mice with tumors in the mammary pad and iliac artery was executed utilizing a different set of six VOCs, with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [0.75, 1.00]). © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "More than a third of the world’s population relies on solid fuels for cooking and heating, with major health consequences. Although solid fuel combustion emissions are known to increase the prevalence of illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, however, their effect on the eyes is underexplored. This study assesses the acute toxicity of solid fuel combustion emissions on healthy ocular cells and a cancer cell line. Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells. This acute exposure study provides compelling proof that biomass combustion emissions compromise the viability of ocular cells and increase ROS generation. The increased ROS generation was fatal for ocular cells, but it promoted the growth of cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "T cells targeting shared oncogenic mutations can induce durable tumor regression in epithelial cancer patients. Such T cells can be detected in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, but whether such cells can be detected in the peripheral blood of patients with the common metastatic epithelial cancer patients is unknown. Using a highly sensitive in vitro stimulation and cell enrichment of peripheral memory T cells from six metastatic cancer patients, we identified and isolated CD4 + , and CD8 + memory T cells targeting the mutated KRAS G12D and KRAS G12V variants, respectively, in three patients. In an additional two metastatic colon cancer patients, we detected CD8 + neoantigen-specific cells targeting the mutated SMAD5 and MUC4 proteins. Therefore, memory T cells targeting unique as well as shared somatic mutations can be detected in the peripheral blood of epithelial cancer patients and can potentially be used for the development of effective personalized T cell-based cancer immunotherapy across multiple patients. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",

    "Abstract": "Indocyanine green (ICG) accumulates only in hepatocytes and their malignant counterpart, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have developed ICG-conjugated anti-cancer drugs and noted their significant accumulation in HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. ICG-conjugated gemcitabine was less toxic to normal cells and it had superior anti-tumor action compared to gemcitabine alone in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft. ICG conjugation can provide a novel fluorescent drug delivery system for treatment of liver cancer and this system can be used to both diagnose and treat HCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Mitochondrial topoisomerase IB (TOP1MT) is a nuclear-encoded topoisomerase, exclusively localized to mitochondria, which resolves topological stress generated during mtDNA replication and transcription. Here, we report that TOP1MT is overexpressed in cancer tissues and demonstrate that TOP1MT deficiency attenuates tumor growth in human and mouse models of colon and liver cancer. Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we show that TOP1MT associates with mitoribosomal subunits, ensuring optimal mitochondrial translation and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes that are critical for sustaining tumor growth. The TOP1MT genomic signature profile, based on Top1mt-KO liver cancers, is correlated with enhanced survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Our results highlight the importance of TOP1MT for tumor development, providing a potential rationale to develop TOP1MT-targeted drugs as anticancer therapies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Personalized cancer therapy relies on identifying patient subsets that benefit from a therapeutic intervention and suggest alternative regimens for those who don’t. A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian carcinoma is caused by multiple factors, but its etiology associated with microbes and infection is unknown. Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing methods, the diversity and composition of the microbiota from ovarian cancer tissues (25 samples) and normal distal fallopian tube tissues (25 samples) were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development. In addition, transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses suggested that the transcriptional profiles were statistically different between ovarian carcinoma and normal distal fallopian tubes. Moreover, a set of genes including 84 different inflammation-associated or immune-associated genes, which had been named as the human antibacterial-response genes were also modulated expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that the microbial composition change, as a novel risk factor, may be involving the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer via influencing and regulating the local immune microenvironment of fallopian tubes except for regular pathways. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Focal oncogene amplification and rearrangements drive tumor growth and evolution in multiple cancer types. We present AmpliconArchitect (AA), a tool to reconstruct the fine structure of focally amplified regions using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and validate it extensively on multiple simulated and real datasets, across a wide range of coverage and copy numbers. Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA. AA reconstruction, integrated with metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PacBio sequencing on the cell-line UPCI:SCC090 confirm the extrachromosomal origin and fine structure of a Forkhead box E1 (FOXE1)-containing hybrid amplicon. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cancer remains one of the biggest threats to human society. There are massive demands for compounds to selectively kill cancerous cells. Earlier studies have shown that bovine α -lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (BAMLET) becomes cytotoxic against cancer cells in complex with oleic acid {Hoque, M. et. al., PLoSOne8, e68390 (2013)}. In our study, we obtained bovine α-lactalbumin complexed with lanthanum ion (La 3+ -B-α-LA) and determined its high resolution crystal structure. The natural calcium binding site of bovine α-lactalbumin is replaced by lanthanum. The La 3+ complex formation by B-α-apo-LA was also supported by various biophysical methods. Interestingly, our complex, La 3+ -B-α-LA exhibits much greater anticancer activity against breast cancer cells as compared to the reported BAMLET-oleic acid complex. This study shows that La 3+ -B-α-LA complex is preferentially more toxic to MCF-7 cells as compared to KB (oral cancer) and HeLa (cervical) cells, while almost non-toxic to the healthy cells that we studied. Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe. These alterations are potentially related to the effects of both chemotherapy and psychological distress. Future research involving a larger sample size of patients with breast cancer is recommended. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Several pioneering work have established that apart from genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications contribute significantly in tumor progression. Remarkable role of EZH2 in cancer highlights the importance of identifying its targets. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential. While investigating the relevance of these target genes, different mutations of them were found in breast cancer patients. Seeking the clinical relevance of our study, following our recent publication that reports the role of EZH2 in nicotine-mediated breast cancer development and progression, we observed significant reduced expression of SUMF1 in breast cancer patient samples with smoking history in comparison to never-smoked patient samples. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Primary bronchial cancer accounts for almost 20% of all cancer death worldwide. One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Oxaliplatin is a key chemotherapy drug in patients with colorectal cancer. Administration of oxaliplatin via a peripheral vein often causes vascular pain. However, no studies have evaluated vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer in relation to peripheral venous administration of chemotherapy with or without oxaliplatin. We evaluated oxaliplatin-induced vascular pain using subjective and objective methods. We determined if oxaliplatin induced vascular pain in patients with colorectal cancer using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and a PainVision PS-2100 device. We compared VAS score between chemotherapy regimens with or without oxaliplatin, and between genders. We also examined the correlations of VAS score with pain intensity examined by the PainVision PS-2100, and with age and vessel diameter. A total of 98 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study, including 78 patients who received oxaliplatin via peripheral venous administration and 20 who received chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. The median VAS scores in patients with and without oxaliplatin were 36.5 (interquartile range 9.0–60.0) and 0 (0–4.0), respectively (P < 0.001), and the median pain intensities according to PainVision were 43.5 (14.3–98) and 36.5 (9.3–58.5), respectively (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between VAS and pain intensity (r = 0.584), but no correlation between VAS score and age (r = −0.174) or vessel diameter (r = −0.107). Peripheral venous administration of oxaliplatin induced vascular pain, measured both subjectively and objectively, in patients with colorectal cancer, regardless of vessel diameter. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate anti-cancer properties of hesperetin (Hsp) and hesperetin-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (HspNPs) for glioblastoma treatment. Nanoparticles prepared by single emulsion method had a size of less than 300 nm with 70.7 ± 3.9% reaction yield and 26.4 ± 1.1% Hsp loading capacity. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with HspNPs for 24 and 48 h resulted in dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with approximate IC50 of 28 and 21 μg/mL, respectively (p = .036 for 24 h, p = .025 for 48 h). The percentage of PCNA positive cells decreased to 20% and 10%, respectively, for Hsp- and HspNP-treated cells at concentration of 100 µg/mL. Treatment with increasing concentrations of HspNPs (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL) resulted in 9.1-, 7-, 12.5- and 12.7-fold in increase in apoptotic cell number. Optimum doses of Hsp and HspNPs were found to increase oxidative damage in C6 glioma cells. MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were found to be significantly elevated at 75 and 100 µg/mL exposure concentration of HspNPs with (p = .002) and (p = .018), respectively for 48-h treatment. The results obtained with this study showed biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle systems has great advantages to enhance anti-cancer activity and poor solubility of therapeutic agents. Overall our findings suggest that Hsp-loaded PLGA nanoparticle systems showed significant anti-cancer activity and HspNPs could be used as promising novel anti-cancer agent.",

    "Abstract": "The selection of effective genes that accurately predict chemotherapy responses might improve cancer outcomes. We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35). This approach should be adaptable to other studies of chemotherapy responses, regardless of the drug or cancer types. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Oxaliplatin is important for the clinical treatment of colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal malignancies, but tumour resistance is limiting. Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Solid malignancies are associated with the development of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for PJP among patients with lung cancer. This retrospective case-control study compared patients who had lung cancer with PJP (n = 112) or without PJP (n = 336) matched according to age, sex, histopathology, and stage. PJP definition was based on (i) positive PCR or direct immunofluorescence results for pneumocystis, (ii) clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities that were consistent with a pneumonic process, and (iii) received targeted PJP treatment. The development of PJP was associated with radiotherapy (RTx), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRTx), lymphopenia, and prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for ≥3 weeks). Multivariate analysis revealed independent associations with prolonged high-dose steroid therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–3.63; p = 0.032) and CCRTx (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.27–3.43; p = 0.004). Steroid use was frequently related to RTx pneumonitis or esophagitis (29 patients, 43.3%). Prolonged high-dose steroid therapy and CCRTx were risk factors for PJP development among patients with lung cancer. As these patients had a poor prognosis, clinicians should consider PJP prophylaxis for high-risk patients with lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Whole exome sequencing (WES), targeted gene panel sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are increasingly used for the identification of actionable alterations that are critical to cancer care. Here, we compared The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) breast cancer genomic datasets (array and next generation sequencing (NGS) data) in detecting genomic alterations in clinically relevant genes. We performed an in silico analysis to determine the concordance in the frequencies of actionable mutations and copy number alterations/aberrations (CNAs) in the two most common breast cancer histologies, invasive lobular and invasive ductal carcinoma. We found that targeted sequencing identified a larger number of mutational hotspots and clinically significant amplifications that would have been missed by WES and SNP arrays in many actionable genes such as PIK3CA, EGFR, AKT3, FGFR1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ESR1. The striking differences between the number of mutational hotspots and CNAs generated from these platforms highlight a number of factors that should be considered in the interpretation of array and NGS-based genomic data for precision medicine. Targeted panel sequencing was preferable to WES to define the full spectrum of somatic mutations present in a tumor. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively. The synergistic effect of p53/p63 with AP2 to activate genes was lost with the L350P/L423P mutation in p53/p63, but p73 bearing the L377P mutation was able to interact with AP2 and exerted its normal synergistic effects. We propose that p73 and AP2 synergistically activate the NEU4 promoter in colon cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Iron deposits are a phenotypic trait of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Histological iron imaging and contrast-agent free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect these deposits, but their presence in human cancer, and correlation with immunotherapeutic response is largely untested. Here, primarily using these iron imaging approaches, we evaluated the spatial distribution of polarized macrophage populations containing high endogenous levels of iron in preclinical murine models and human breast cancer, and used them as metabolic biomarkers to correlate TAM infiltration with response to immunotherapy in preclinical trials. Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins. We therefore demonstrate that iron deposition serves as an endogenous metabolic imaging biomarker of TAM infiltration in breast cancer that has high translational potential for evaluation of immunotherapeutic response. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as second messengers in signal transduction, but high ROS levels can also cause cell death. MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO), the most common derivative of graphene, is an exceptional nanomaterial that possesses multiple physical properties critical for biomedical applications. GO exhibits pH-dependent fluorescence emission in the visible/near-infrared, providing a possibility of molecular imaging and pH-sensing. It is also water soluble and has a substantial platform for functionalization, allowing for the delivery of multiple therapeutics. GO physical properties are modified to enhance cellular internalization, producing fluorescent nanoflakes with low (<15%) cytotoxicity at the imaging concentrations of 15 μg/mL. As a result, at lower flake sizes GO rapidly internalizes into HeLa cells with the following 70% fluorescence based clearance at 24 h, assessed by its characteristic emission in red/near-IR. pH-dependence of GO emission is utilized to provide the sensing of acidic extracellular environments of cancer cells. The results demonstrate diminishing green/red (550/630 nm) fluorescence intensity ratios for HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells in comparison to HEK-293 healthy cells suggesting a potential use of GO as a non-invasive optical sensor for cancer microenvironments. The results of this work demonstrate the potential of GO as a novel multifunctional platform for therapeutic delivery, biological imaging and cancer sensing. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is a group of multigenic diseases. It is the most common cancer diagnosed among women worldwide and is often treated with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is catalysed by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), and inter-individual variations in the enzyme due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could alter enzyme activity. We evaluated SNPs in patients from Colombia in South America who were receiving tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer. Allelic diversity in the CYP2D6 gene was found in the studied population, with two patients displaying the poor-metaboliser phenotype. Molecular dynamics and trajectory analyses were performed for CYP2D6 from these two patients, comparing it with the common allelic form (CYP2D6*1). Although we found no significant structural change in the protein, its dynamics differ significantly from those of CYP2D6*1, the effect of such differential dynamics resulting in an inefficient enzyme with serious implications for tamoxifen-treated patients, increasing the risk of disease relapse and ineffective treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We aimed to assess if GLP-1 agonists are associated with pancreatic cancer. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials with GLP-1 agonists as an intervention was performed. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to assess if the available information is sufficient to reject this association. Twelve trials met the study criteria, with a total of 36, 397 patients. GLP-1 analogues did not increase the risk for pancreatic cancer when compared to other treatments (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; I 2 14%). TSA confirmed that enough patients were randomized and again no association of the medications and pancreatic cancer was observed considering a NNH of 1000 and the short mean follow-up of the included trials (1.7 years). Larger studies with longer duration would be required to exclude a greater NNH and to aside concerns regarding possible influence of study duration and the outcome. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bladder cancer is one of the most common and highly vascularized cancers. To better understand its genomic structure and underlying etiology, we conduct whole-genome and targeted sequencing in urothelial bladder carcinomas (UBCs, the most common type of bladder cancer). Recurrent mutations in noncoding regions affecting gene regulatory elements and structural variations (SVs) leading to gene disruptions are prevalent. Notably, we find recurrent ADGRG6 enhancer mutations and FRS2 duplications which are associated with higher protein expression in the tumor and poor prognosis. Functional assays demonstrate that depletion of ADGRG6 or FRS2 expression in UBC cells compromise their abilities to recruit endothelial cells and induce tube formation. Moreover, pathway assessment reveals recurrent alterations in multiple angiogenesis-related genes. These results illustrate a multidimensional genomic landscape that highlights noncoding mutations and SVs in UBC tumorigenesis, and suggest ADGRG6 and FRS2 as novel pathological angiogenesis regulators that would facilitate vascular-targeted therapies for UBC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "ADP-ribosylation is a unique posttranslational modification catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) using NAD + as ADP-ribose donor. PARPs play an indispensable role in DNA damage repair and small molecule PARP inhibitors have emerged as potent anticancer drugs. However, to date, PARP inhibitor treatment has been restricted to patients with BRCA1/2 mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancer. One of the major challenges to extend the therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors to other cancer types is the absence of predictive biomarkers. Here, we show that ovarian cancer cells with higher level of NADP + , an NAD + derivative, are more sensitive to PARP inhibitors. We demonstrate that NADP + acts as a negative regulator and suppresses ADP-ribosylation both in vitro and in vivo. NADP + impairs ADP-ribosylation-dependent DNA damage repair and sensitizes tumor cell to chemically synthesized PARP inhibitors. Taken together, our study identifies NADP + as an endogenous PARP inhibitor that may have implications in cancer treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor suppressor SMARCA4 (BRG1), a key SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling gene, is frequently inactivated in cancers and is not directly druggable. We recently uncovered that SMARCA4 loss in an ovarian cancer subtype causes cyclin D1 deficiency leading to susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibition. Here, we show that this vulnerability is conserved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where SMARCA4 loss also results in reduced cyclin D1 expression and selective sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In addition, SMARCA2, another SWI/SNF subunit lost in a subset of NSCLCs, also regulates cyclin D1 and drug response when SMARCA4 is absent. Mechanistically, SMARCA4/2 loss reduces cyclin D1 expression by a combination of restricting CCND1 chromatin accessibility and suppressing c-Jun, a transcription activator of CCND1. Furthermore, SMARCA4 loss is synthetic lethal with CDK4/6 inhibition both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors could be effective to treat this significant subgroup of NSCLCs. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AGAP2 (Arf GAP with GTP-binding protein-like domain, Ankyrin repeat and PH domain 2) isoform 2 is considered a proto-oncogene, but not much is known about AGAP2 gene expression regulation. To get some insight into this process, AGAP2 proximal promoter was cloned and characterised using reporter assays. We have identified SP1 as a transcription factor bound to AGAP2 promoter and required for AGAP2 expression in two different types of cancer cells (KU812, a chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line; and DU145, a prostate cancer cell line): silencing SP1 decreased AGAP2 protein levels. We have also found that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment increased AGAP2 protein levels in both cell lines whilst curcumin treatment reduced ATRA-mediated AGAP2 increase. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed the presence of RARα, RXRα and the lysine acetyl transferase PCAF in AGAP2 promoter. Our results provide a novel understanding of AGAP2 expression regulation that could be beneficial to those patients with cancers where AGAP2 is overexpressed. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant metabolism of cancer cells is well appreciated, but the identification of cancer subsets with specific metabolic vulnerabilities remains challenging. We conducted a chemical biology screen and identified a subset of neuroendocrine tumors displaying a striking pattern of sensitivity to inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Using a variety of orthogonal approaches, we demonstrate that sensitivity to SQLE inhibition results not from cholesterol biosynthesis pathway inhibition, but rather surprisingly from the specific and toxic accumulation of the SQLE substrate, squalene. These findings highlight SQLE as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of neuroendocrine tumors, particularly small cell lung cancers. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The HER2 oncogene and its truncated form p95HER2 play central roles in breast cancer. Here, we show that although HER2 and p95HER2 generally elicit qualitatively similar changes in miRNA profile in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, a subset of changes are distinct and p95HER2 shifts the miRNA profile towards the basal breast cancer subtype. High-throughput miRNA profiling was carried out 15, 36 and 60 h after HER2 or p95HER2 expression and central hits validated by RT-qPCR. miRNAs strongly regulated by p95HER2 yet not by HER2, included miR-221, miR-222, miR-503, miR-29a, miR-149, miR-196 and miR-361. Estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) expression was essentially ablated by p95HER2 expression, in a manner recapitulated by miR-221/-222 mimics. c-Myb family transcription factors MYB and MYBL1, but not MYBL2, were downregulated by p95HER2 and by miR-503 or miR-221/-222 mimics. MYBL1 3′UTR inhibition by miR-221/222 was lost by deletion of a single putative miR-221/222 binding sites. p95HER2 expression, or knockdown of either MYB protein, elicited upregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease-2 (TIMP2). miR-221/222 and -503 mimics increased, and TIMP2 knockdown decreased, cell migration and invasion. A similar pathway was operational in T47D- and SKBr-3 cells. This work reveals important differences between HER2- and p95HER2- mediated miRNA changes in breast cancer cells, provides novel mechanistic insight into regulation of MYB family transcription factors by p95HER2, and points to a role for a miR-221/222– MYB family–TIMP2 axis in regulation of motility in breast cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a lack of hormonal receptors and HER2 overexpression. It is the only breast cancer subgroup that does not benefit from targeted therapies, and its prognosis is poor. Several studies have developed specific molecular classifications for triple-negative breast cancer. However, these molecular subtypes have had little impact in the clinical setting. Gene expression data and clinical information from 494 triple-negative breast tumors were obtained from public databases. First, a probabilistic graphical model approach to associate gene expression profiles was performed. Then, sparse k-means was used to establish a new molecular classification. Results were then verified in a second database including 153 triple-negative breast tumors treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Clinical and gene expression data from 494 triple-negative breast tumors were analyzed. Tumors in the dataset were divided into four subgroups (luminal-androgen receptor expressing, basal, claudin-low and claudin-high), using the cancer stem cell hypothesis as reference. These four subgroups were defined and characterized through hierarchical clustering and probabilistic graphical models and compared with previously defined classifications. In addition, two subgroups related to immune activity were defined. This immune activity showed prognostic value in the whole cohort and in the luminal subgroup. The claudin-high subgroup showed poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Through a novel analytical approach we proved that there are at least two independent sources of biological information: cellular and immune. Thus, we developed two different and overlapping triple-negative breast cancer classifications and showed that the luminal immune-positive subgroup had better prognoses than the luminal immune-negative. Finally, this work paves the way for using the defined classifications as predictive features in the neoadjuvant scenario. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Dysregulation of RNA splicing by spliceosome mutations or in cancer genes is increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer. Small molecule splicing modulators have been introduced into clinical trials to treat solid tumors or leukemia bearing recurrent spliceosome mutations. Nevertheless, further investigation of the molecular mechanisms that may enlighten therapeutic strategies for splicing modulators is highly desired. Here, using unbiased functional approaches, we report that the sensitivity to splicing modulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family genes is a key mechanism underlying preferential cytotoxicity induced by the SF3b-targeting splicing modulator E7107. While BCL2A1, BCL2L2 and MCL1 are prone to splicing perturbation, BCL2L1 exhibits resistance to E7107-induced splicing modulation. Consequently, E7107 selectively induces apoptosis in BCL2A1-dependent melanoma cells and MCL1-dependent NSCLC cells. Furthermore, combination of BCLxL (BCL2L1-encoded) inhibitors and E7107 remarkably enhances cytotoxicity in cancer cells. These findings inform mechanism-based approaches to the future clinical development of splicing modulators in cancer treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Aggressive behaviours of solid tumours are highly influenced by the tumour microenvironment. Multiple signalling pathways can affect the normal function of stromal fibroblasts in tumours, but how these events are coordinated to generate tumour-promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is not well understood. Here we show that stromal expression of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) is associated with aggressive breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers. We demonstrate that DKK3 is a HSF1 effector that modulates the pro-tumorigenic behaviour of CAFs in vitro and in vivo. DKK3 orchestrates a concomitant activation of β-catenin and YAP/TAZ. Whereas β-catenin is dispensable for CAF-mediated ECM remodelling, cancer cell growth and invasion, DKK3-driven YAP/TAZ activation is required to induce tumour-promoting phenotypes. Mechanistically, DKK3 in CAFs acts via canonical Wnt signalling by interfering with the negative regulator Kremen and increasing cell-surface levels of LRP6.

    "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) carry a wealth of information on primary and metastatic tumors critical for precise cancer detection, monitoring, and treatment. Numerous microfluidic platforms have been developed in the past few years to capture these rare cells in patient bloodstream for deciphering the critical information needed. However, the practical need for a high-quality method of CTC isolation remains to be met. Herein, we demonstrate a novel multi-flow microfluidic device that is able to sensitively provide high purity (>87%) of separation outcome without labeling. Our device is constructed and configured based on the phenomenal effect of size-dependent inertial migration. The recovery rate of >93% has been achieved using spiked cancer cells at clinically relevant concentrations (10 cells per 5 mL and above). We have also successfully detected CTCs from 6 out of 8 non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) patients, while none for 5 healthy control subjects. With these results, we envision our approach is a promising alternative for reliable CTC capture, and thus for facilitating the progress of extracting information from CTCs to personalize treatment strategies for solid tumor patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Most targeting strategies of anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs) rely on the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with specific ligands, which trigger the internalization in cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite the widening range of high-throughput platforms and exponential growth of generated data volume, the validation of biomarkers discovered from large-scale data remains a challenging field. In order to tackle cancer heterogeneity and comply with the data dimensionality, a number of network and pathway approaches were invented but rarely systematically applied to this task. We propose a new method, called NEAmarker, for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways. These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables. The method was first tested using in vitro data from three anti-cancer drug screens and then on clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new screen of anti-cancer compounds validated the performance of multivariate models of drug sensitivity. The previously proposed methods of enrichment analysis could achieve comparable levels of performance in certain tests. However, only our method could discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Some inflammatory biomarkers are associated with the post-surgical prognosis in cancer patients. However, their clinical importance in gallbladder cancer has rarely been explored. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of surgical intervention and the effectiveness of preoperative test on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) for predicting the prognosis in gallbladder cancer patients. In this study, a total of 255 gallbladder cancer patients were retrospectively selected. For each patient, we recorded his/her treatment algorithm (with or without surgery) and their preoperative inflammatory biomarkers, as well as their detailed survival information for 5 years. A total of 216 patients received surgical intervention and the other 39 chose conservative treatment. The median survival time was 4.6 months for non-surgical group (P < 0.001), and 12.2 months for surgical intervention group. Among the surgical group, ROC analysis showed the AUC of NLR, PLR and MLR were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.600 to 0.751, P < 0.001), 0.599 (95% CI: 0.520 to 0.677, P = 0.017) and 0.607 (95% CI: 0.529 to 0.686, P = 0.009), respectively. In conclusion, surgical intervention did improve the overall survival, and elevated NLR and MLR before surgery are associated with shorter OS of GBC patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Predictive utility of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with concurrent trastuzumab remains unclear. We examined TILs grades of pretreatment cancer tissue specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab and determined the predictive utility of the TILs grade in pathological complete response (pCR) and the prognostic power of TILs in HER2-positive breast cancer. This cohort study included 128 HER2-positive breast cancer who received NAC with trastuzumab. TILs grading of the tumor stroma in pretreatment biopsy specimens and residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab was categorized as low, intermediate, and high based on the criteria of the International Working Group. In current study, the pCR rate was 64.8%, and the Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly worse in the non-pCR group than in the pCR group. The pCR rate correlated with the TILs grade in pretreatment tumors. In 45 non-pCR patients, TILs grade was higher in the residual tumors than in the pretreatment tumors. The RFS was significantly better in residual tumors with high TILs grade than those with low TILs grade (p = 0.033). In conclusion, assessment of the TILs grade in residual tumors after NAC with trastuzumab might be necessary to determine patients with good prognosis among those who do not achieve pCR. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We aimed to evaluate and determine the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in early stage cervical cancer (CC) patients. Patients with primary cervical cancer and newly diagnosed were selected from ten different cancer specialist hospitals of Malaysia. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were obtained for the prognostic analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate patients’ survival time (CSS and OS) with DM status and values were compared using the log-rank test. A total of 19,785 newly diagnosed CC patients were registered during 2010–2016, among them only 16,946 (85.6%) with primary CC tumor. There was no difference in treatment modality between DM and non-DM patients. However intergroup assessment showed that type 2DM have significantly higher rate of mortality in both overall mortality (28.3%) and CC-specific (11.7%) as compared to Type 1DM (17.3%; 5.5%) and non DM patients (12.7%; 9.1%) (p < 0.001). Within group assessments showed that Type 2DM patients have better quality of life (mean 7.13 ± 3.67) (p < 0.001) and less distress levels (mean 2.41 ± 0.63) (p < 0.011) as compared to type1 DM (meant 10.54 ± 2.11; 3.19 ± 1.07). This study concluded that T2DM prognostic effect still remained after adjusting demographic and clinical parameters. Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed better OS and CSS then type2 DM. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A novel multifunctional nanoplatform constructed from methoxy-PEGylated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) generation 3 dendrimers with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) entrapped in their core, containing curcumin as the payload drug and folic acid (folate) as the targeting ligand (abbreviated as FA-mPEG-PAMAM G3-CUR@SPIONs), is presented in this study. SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex. Therefore, functionalizing the nanocomplex with folate modulated the response to thermo-chemotherapy by shifting the cell death pathways toward apoptosis.",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and approximately 42% of all cases diagnosed each year worldwide are diagnosed in China. A large number of clinical applications have revealed that Trametes robiniophila Μurr. (Huaier) exhibits an anti-tumour effect. However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier. These results suggest that Huaier n-butanol extract could be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy is a major cause of therapeutic failure in colon cancer cure. Development of combined therapies constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit cancer cells and prevent the emergence of drug resistance. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups. Overall, our data propose Kaempferol as a potential chemotherapeutic agent to be used alone or in combination with 5-FU to overcome colon cancer drug resistance. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 15–20% of breast tumors and associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. p130Cas represents a nodal scaffold protein regulating cell survival, migration and proliferation in normal and pathological contexts. p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 human breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis formation. Recent data indicate that p130Cas association to ErbB2 protects ErbB2 from degradation, thus enhancing tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibiting p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction might represent a new therapeutic strategy to target breast cancer. Here we demonstrate by performing Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, dot blot, ELISA and fluorescence quenching experiments, that p130Cas binds directly to ErbB2. Then, by structure-based virtual screening, we identified two potential inhibitors of p130Cas/ErbB2 interaction. Their experimental validation was performed in vitro and in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cellular models. The results highlight that both compounds interfere with p130Cas/ErbB2 binding and significantly affect cell proliferation and sensitivity to Trastuzumab. Overall, this study identifies p130Cas/ErbB2 complex as a potential breast cancer target revealing new therapeutic perspectives for protein-protein interaction (PPI). © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Synchronous liver metastasis (SLM) remains a major challenge for rectal cancer. Early detection of SLM is a key factor to improve the survival rate of rectal cancer. In this radiomics study, we predicted the SLM based on the radiomics of primary rectal cancer. A total of 328 radiomics features were extracted from the T2WI images of 194 patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to reduce the feature dimension and to construct the radiomics signature. after LASSO, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to sort the features of the surplus characteristics, and selected the features of the total contribution of 85%. Then the prediction model was built by linear regression, and the decision curve analysis was used to judge the net benefit of LASSO and PCA. In addition, we used two independent cohorts for training (n = 135) and validation (n = 159). We found that the model based on LASSO dimensionality construction had the maximum net benefit (in the training set (AUC [95% confidence interval], 0.857 [0.787–0.912]) and in the validation set (0.834 [0.714–0.918]). The radiomics nomogram combined with clinical risk factors and LASSO features showed a good predictive performance in the training set (0.921 [0.862–0.961]) and validation set (0.912 [0.809–0.97]). Our study indicated that radiomics based on primary rectal cancer could provide a non-invasive way to predict the risk of SLM in clinical practice. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, predominantly developing from squamous cell epithelia (HNSCC). The main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, excessive alcohol use, and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV positive (+) cancers are etiologically different from other HNSCC and often show better prognosis. The current knowledge regarding HNSCC miRNA profiles is still incomplete especially in the context of HPV+ cancer. Thus, we analyzed 61 freshly collected primary oral (OSCC) and oropharyngeal (OPSCC) SCC samples. HPV DNA and RNA was found in 21% cases. The Illumina whole-genome small-RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing was done on 22 samples and revealed 7 specific miRNAs to HPV+ OSCC, 77 to HPV+ OPSCC, and additional 3 shared with both; 51 miRNAs were specific to HPV− OPSCC, 62 to HPV− OSCC, and 31 shared with both. The results for 9 miRNAs (miR-9, -21, -29a, -100, -106b, -143 and -145) were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction on the whole study population. The data was additionally confirmed by reanalyzing publicly available miRNA sequencing Cancer Genome Atlas consortium (TCGA) HNSCC data. Cell signaling pathway analysis revealed differences between HPV+ and HPV− HNSCC. Our findings compared with literature data revealed extensive heterogeneity of miRNA deregulation with only several miRNAs consistently affected, and miR-9 being the most likely HPV related miRNA. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The association between perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) with adverse oncological outcomes have been previously reported in multiple malignancies including RCC. Nevertheless, the importance of transfusion timing is still unclear. The primary purpose of this study is to appraise whether the receipt of intraoperative blood transfusion (BT) differ from postoperative BT in regards to cancer outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nephrectomy. Data on 1168 patients with RCC, who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy as primary therapy between 1988–2013 were analyzed. PBT was defined as transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) during surgery or the postsurgical period. Survival was analyzed and compared using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Of 1168 patients, 198 patients (16.9%) received a PBT. Including 117 intraoperative BT and 81 postoperative BT. Only 21 (10.6%) patients required both intraoperative and postoperative BT. On multivariate analyses, receipt of PBT was associated with significantly worse local disease recurrence (HR: 2.4; P = 0.017), metastatic progression (HR: 2.7; P = 0.005), cancer-specific mortality (HR: 3.5; P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.1; P = 0.005). Nevertheless, postoperative BT was not independently associated with increased risk of local recurrence (p = 0.1), metastatic progression (P = 0.16) or kidney cancer death (P = 0.63), yet did significantly increase the risk of overall mortality (HR: 2.6; P = 0.004). In the current study, intraoperative transfusion of allogeneic RBC is associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and mortality following nephrectomy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Using standardized forms for prescription and administration of medications is one of the main solutions for reducing medication errors in the chemotherapy process. Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer, in this study we tried to design and validate a standard printed form and evaluate oncologists’ and nurses’ adherence to this form. This cross-sectional study was performed in Omid hospital, Mashhad, Iran from January 2015 to October 2015. A Chemotherapy form including various demographic and clinical parameters and approved chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer was designed by the clinical pharmacist and validated by clinical oncologists working in this center. All eligible patients admitted in this center during this period of time were included in the study. Adherence of the oncologists and nurses to this form and probable medication errors were identified by the pharmacy student. Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer and a total of 251 chemotherapy courses were evaluated. All patients received regimens compatible with developed form but in 206 courses (98.56%) of chemotherapy dosing error happened and in most of cases patients received lower than calculated dose (37.8%). Three errors occurred in administration step by nurses which they infused the medication in shorter than recommended duration. In general, oncologists’ adherence with developed form for chemotherapy of colorectal cancer was relatively high, except in dose calculation. Avoiding from rounding the calculated medications’ doses and precise calculation of patients’ body surface area can prevent most of medication errors and reduce risk of adverse drug reaction occurrence. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Halophilic archaea are known as the novel producers of natural products and their supernatant metabolites could have cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. In the present study, we screened the anticancer potential of supernatant metabolites from eight native haloarchaeal strains obtained from a culture collection in Iran. Five human cancer cell lines including breast, lung, prostate and also human fibroblast cells as the normal control were used in the present study. Moreover, to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the selected supernatant, inhibition of sphere formation and tumor development was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo, respectively. Among all strains, supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 had the most potent cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 0.5 mg/mL) without any effects on normal cells. It significantly increased both early and late apoptosis (about 11% and 9%, respectively) in the androgen-dependent PC3 cell line, reduced sphere formation ability of DU145 and PC3 cells with down-regulation of SOX2 gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that tumors developed in nude mice significantly shrank post intratumor injection of metabolites of the haloarchaeal strain. In conclusion, we suggested here for the first time that supernatant metabolites from Halobacterium salinarum IBRC M10715 could be a novel component against prostate cancer in-vitro and in-vivo with remarkable reduction in stem-like properties of tumor. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are primary effectors of cytotoxicity induced by many anti-cancer drugs. Rhythms in the pseudo-steady-state (PSS) levels of particular intracellular ROS in cancer cells and their relevance to drug effectiveness are unknown thus far. We report that the PSS levels of intracellular superoxide (SOX), an important ROS, exhibit an inherent rhythm in HCT116 colon cancer cells, which is entrained (reset) by the SOX inducer, menadione (MD). This reset was dependent on the expression of p53, and it doubled the sensitivity of the cells to MD. The period of oscillation was found to have a linear correlation with MD concentration, given by the equation, T, in h = 23.52 − 1.05 [MD concentration in µM]. Further, we developed a mathematical model to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in rhythm reset. Biologically meaningful parameters were obtained through parameter estimation techniques; the model can predict experimental profiles of SOX, establish qualitative relations between interacting species in the system and serves as an important tool to understand the profiles of various species. The model was also able to successfully predict the rhythm reset in MD treated hepatoma cell line, HepG2. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) for cancer treatment is emerging as a successful strategy that combines the direct, targeted killing of the cancer with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response. Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge. This study establishes that OV-therapy confers long-term protection when administered in the pre-operative window of opportunity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still one of the most aggressive adult cancers with an unacceptable prognosis. For this reason novel therapies accounting for PDAC peculiarities, such as the relevant stromal reaction, are urgently needed. Here adipose mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (AD-MSC) have been armed to constantly release a soluble trimeric and multimeric variant of the known anti-cancer TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). This cancer gene therapy strategy was in vitro challenged demonstrating that sTRAIL was thermally stable and able to induce apoptosis in the PDAC lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and against primary PDAC cells. sTRAIL released by AD-MSC relocated into the tumor stroma was able to significantly counteract tumor growth in vivo with a significant reduction in tumor size, in cytokeratin-7+ cells and by an anti-angiogenic effect. In parallel, histology on PDAC specimens form patients (n = 19) was performed to investigate the levels of TRAIL DR4, DR5 and OPG receptors generating promising insights on the possible clinical translation of our approach. These results indicate that adipose MSC can very efficiently vehicle a novel TRAIL variant opening unexplored opportunities for PDAC treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Protein kinase D2 (PKD2) has been reported to be related with progression and invasion in various cancers. However, its prognostic value and the underlying mechanism in lung cancer remains unclear. Herein we evaluated the expression of PKD2 in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated its relationship with EMT. GSEA, TCGA and K-M plotter database were applied and revealed that high PKD2 expression predicted poor outcome and related with lymph nodes metastasis in lung cancer. IHC and qRT-PCR were performed and found PKD2 was elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and negatively related with OS (p = 0.015), PFS (p = 0.006) and the level of E-cadherin (p = 0.021). Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Malignant melanoma is one of the untreatable cancers in which conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, are hardly effective. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic targets involved in melanoma progression is urgently needed for developing effective therapeutic methods. Overexpression of interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2) is observed in several cancer types including glioma and pancreatic cancer. Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin. These results suggest that IL13Rα2 enhances tumorigenicity by inducing angiogenesis in malignant melanoma, and serves as a potential therapeutic target of malignant melanoma. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The incidence of developing cancer should increase with the body mass, yet is not the case, a conundrum referred to as Peto’s paradox. Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We have shown that Raman microspectroscopy is a powerful method for visualization of glycocalyx offering cellular interrogation without staining, unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution, and biochemical information. We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors. We have identified two glycoforms in the normal breast tissue and the malignant brain tissue in contrast to the breast cancer tissue where only one glycoform has been identified. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite recent improvements in treatment, ovarian cancer is still the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. Today, marine mollusks are considered as natural source of new biologically and pharmacologically active compounds by scientists and the pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study is to investigate the selective apoptotic effects of Turbo coronatus crude extract fractions on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and mitochondria. The cells and mitochondria were isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous ovarian tissues and exposed to IC 50 concentration of F1 fraction for evaluation of mitochondrial and cellular parameters. Our results showed that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract significantly induced toxic effects only in the cancerous ovarian mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial swelling, and cytochrome c release.Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that F1 fraction of T. coronatus progressively induced apoptosis and necrosis only on EOC but not non-cancerous cells. We eventuallyconcluded that F1 fraction of T. coronatus crude extract selectively induces apoptosis in EOC through a ROS-mediated pathway. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Very recently, we postulated that the incorporation of citral into nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC-Citral) improves solubility and delivery of the citral without toxic effects in vivo. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer effects of NLC-Citral in MDA MB-231 cells in vitro through the Annexin V, cell cycle, JC-1 and fluorometric assays. Additionally, this study is aimed to effects of NLC-Citral in reducing the tumor weight and size in 4T1 induced murine breast cancer model. Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the NLC-Citral inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro, majorly through the induction of apoptosis, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis potentials, and reducing the tumor weight and size without altering the therapeutic effects of citral. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known for its hypovascularity. Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic drug, added to standard chemotherapy demonstrated no improvement in outcome for PDAC. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased vascularity may be associated with improved outcomes in PDAC possibly due to better delivery of tumor specific immune cells. To test this hypothesis, PDAC patients were classified into either high or low CD31 expression groups utilizing mRNA expression from RNA-sequence data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pancreatic cancer cohort. High expression of CD31, which indicates presence of more vascular endothelial cells, was associated with significantly better OS (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that residual tumor (R1, 2; p = 0.026) and CD31 low expression (p = 0.007) were the only independent predictors that negatively impacted OS. Vascular stability as well as immune response related pathways were significantly upregulated in the CD31 high expressing tumors. Furthermore, there were higher proportions of anti-cancer immune cells infiltration, including activated memory CD4+ T cells (p = 0.038), CD8+ T cells (p = 0.027), gamma-delta T cells (p < 0.001) as well as naïve B cells (p = 0.006), whereas lower proportions of regulatory T cell fractions (p = 0.009), which induce an immune tolerant microenvironment, in the CD31 high expressing tumors. These findings imply that stable vessels supply anti-cancer immune cells, which are at least partially responsible for better OS in the CD31 high expressing tumors. In conclusion, CD31 high expressing PDACs have better OS, which may be due to stable vessels that supply anti-cancer immune cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The present study was aimed to develop an effective nanoliposomal vaccine delivery system with P435 HER2/neu-derived peptide conjugated to Maleimide-PEG2000-DSPE. The nanoliposome formulation composed of DSPC/DSPG/Chol/DOPE and monophosphoryl lipid A was used as an adjuvant. Liposomal formulations were prepared and their physical properties were characterized. Anti-tumoral efficacy of formulations was evaluated by immunization of tumor-bearing BALB/c mice and the generated immune response was studied by using ELISpot and flow cytometry analysis. The results of the study demonstrated Lip + DOPE + P535 formulation caused the lowest tumor size and the longest survival time in TUBO mice model and could make it a promising candidate in developing effective vaccines against HER2-positive breast cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Derailed transmembrane receptor trafficking could be a hallmark of tumorigenesis and increased tumor invasiveness, but receptor dynamics have not been used to differentiate metastatic cancer cells from less invasive ones. Using single-particle tracking techniques, we developed a phenotyping asssay named Transmembrane Receptor Dynamics (TReD), studied the dynamics of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in seven breast epithelial cell lines and developed a phenotyping assay named Transmembrane Receptor Dynamics (TReD). Here we show a clear evidence that increased EGFR diffusivity and enlarged EGFR confinement size in the plasma membrane (PM) are correlated with the enhanced metastatic potential in these cell lines. By comparing the TReD results with the gene expression profiles, we found a clear negative correlation between the EGFR diffusivities and the breast cancer luminal differentiation scores (r = −0.75). Upon the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), EGFR diffusivity significantly increased for the non-tumorigenic MCF10A (99%) and the non-invasive MCF7 (56%) cells, but not for the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cell. We believe that the reorganization of actin filaments during EMT modified the PM structures, causing the receptor dynamics to change. TReD can thus serve as a new biophysical marker to probe the metastatic potential of cancer cells and even to monitor the transition of metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Plastin 3 (PLS3) overexpression may serve as a marker for predicting chemotherapeutic outcomes in drug-resistant cancer cells, but the mechanism is unclear. Herein, we show that the down-regulation of PLS3 by PLS3 gene silencing augments the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells to paclitaxel. Interestingly, a low concentration of paclitaxel was able to induce strong apoptosis in the PLS3-silenced cells. Further study revealed that p38 MAPK signalling was responsible for the increased sensitivity to paclitaxel in these cells, as the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 impaired the changes mediated by PLS3 down-regulation in response to paclitaxel. Therefore, our study identifies PLS3 as a potential target for enhancing the p38 MAPK-mediated apoptosis induced by paclitaxel. Unlike paclitaxel, Abraxane was unable to induce strong apoptosis in the PLS3-silenced cells. As PLS3 was found to be involved in the process of endocytosis in breast cancer cells, the reliance of cellular Abraxane uptake on this process may render it not as efficient as paclitaxel in PLS3-depleted tumour cells. The finding that PLS3 could be a critical regulator of paclitaxel sensitivity may have important implications for breast cancer chemotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "The efficacy of chemotherapy for cancer treatment can be increased by targeted drug delivery to the cancer cells. This is particularly important for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) for which chemotherapy is a major form of treatment. Here we designed and screened a library of 30 peptides starting with a previously reported epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting peptide GE11 (YHWYGYTPQNVI). A direct peptide array-whole cell binding assay, where the peptides are conjugated to a cellulose membrane, was used to identify four peptides with enhanced binding to TNBC cells. Next, the four peptides were synthesized as FITC-labelled soluble peptides to study their direct uptake by TNBC cells using flow cytometry. The results showed that peptide analogue 22 had several fold higher uptake by the TNBC cells compared to the lead peptide GE11. The specific uptake of the peptide analogue 22 was confirmed by competition experiment using pure EGF protein. Further, peptide 22 showed dose dependent uptake by the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells (10 5 ) with uptake saturating at around 2 μM peptide concentration. Thus, peptide 22 is a promising EGFR specific TNBC cell binding peptide that can be conjugated directly to a chemotherapeutic drug or to nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Metastasis is one of the main causes of mortality in cancer patients. Inotilone, a major component of Inonotus linteus, is a traditional Chinese medical herb. In this study, MTT results showed that inotilone had no obvious cytotoxicity. Animal model results revealed that inotilone suppressed cancer metastatic efficacy. Serum results showed that inotilone reduced the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) activity as well as NO content. Additionally, inotilone affected MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 protein expression and improved the activity of the antioxidant enzymes in the lung tissues of LLC-bearing mice. In addition, cell experimental results showed that inotilone reduced the activity of MMP-2/-9 and inhibited the ability for cellular migration and invasion. Inotilone decreased interleukin (IL)-8 expression in A549 cells. Western blot results revealed that inotilone affected the protein expression of MMPs, nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, anti-oxidant enzymes, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT, and nuclear factor (NF)κB. Therefore, we propose that inotilone is a potential therapeutic candidate against metastatic lung cancer cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can enzymatically transferred acetyl functional group from protein or lysine residues of histone, so they can regulate the expression of lots of genes. Now HDACs are used as drug targets and many HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) were approved for cancer therapy or in clinical trials. However, the physiological mechanisms and regulatory processes of HDACi anti-cancer effects are largely unexplored and uncompleted. Here we use the virtual screening workflow obtained 25 hit compounds and ZINC24469384 can significantly inhibit HDAC activity while arrest cell cycle at G1/S phase and significantly induced HepG2 cell apoptosis, time-course RNA-seq demonstrate that HepG2 cells transcriptionally respond to ZINC24469384. Pathway analysis of DEGs and DASGs reveal that NR1H4 may play an important role in ZINC24469384-induced anti-proliferation effect and is dramatically alleviated by down-regulating the SOCS2 expression and promoting STAT3 phosphorylation in knockdown NR1H4 HepG2 cells. Analysis based on TCGA database indicated that NR1H4 and SOCS2 were downregulated in liver cancer, this suggest NR1H4 and SOCS2 may play an important role in tumorigenesis. These results indicated that ZINC24469384 is a novel benzamine lead compound of HDACi and provides a novel mechanism for HDACi to inhibit cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Developing tumors interact with the surrounding microenvironment. Myeloid cells exert both anti- and pro-tumor functions and chemokines are known to drive immune cell migration towards cancer cells. It is documented that CXCR4 signaling supports tumor metastasis formation in tissues where CXCL12, its cognate ligand, is abundant. On the other hand, the role of the neutrophilic CXCR4 signaling in driving cancer invasion and metastasis formation is poorly understood. Here, we use the zebrafish xenotransplantation model to study the role of CXCR4 signaling in driving the interaction between invasive human tumor cells and host neutrophils, supporting early metastasis formation. We found that zebrafish cxcr4 (cxcr4b) is highly expressed in neutrophils and experimental micrometastases fail to form in mutant larvae lacking a functional Cxcr4b. We demonstrated that Cxcr4b controls neutrophil number and motility and showed that Cxcr4b transcriptomic signature relates to motility and adhesion regulation in neutrophils in tumor-naïve larvae. Finally, Cxcr4b deficient neutrophils failed to interact with cancer cells initiating early metastatic events. In conclusion, we propose that CXCR4 signaling supports the interaction between tumor cells and host neutrophils in developing tumor metastases. Therefore, targeting CXCR4 on tumor cells and neutrophils could serve as a double bladed razor to limit cancer progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death, despite the advent of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Therefore, it is crucial to identify novel molecular features unique to lung tumors. Here, we show that cyclopamine tartrate (CycT) strongly suppresses the growth of subcutaneously implanted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenografts and nearly eradicated orthotopically implanted NSCLC xenografts. CycT reduces heme synthesis and degradation in NSCLC cells and suppresses oxygen consumption in purified mitochondria. In orthotopic tumors, CycT decreases the levels of proteins and enzymes crucial for heme synthesis, uptake, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). CycT also decreases the levels of two regulators promoting OXPHOS, MYC and MCL1, and effectively alleviates tumor hypoxia. Evidently, CycT acts via multiple modes to suppress OXPHOS. One mode is to directly inhibit mitochondrial respiration/OXPHOS. Another mode is to inhibit heme synthesis and degradation. Both modes appear to be independent of hedgehog signaling. Addition of heme to NSCLC cells partially reverses the effect of CycT on oxygen consumption, proliferation, and tumorigenic functions. Together, our results strongly suggest that CycT suppress tumor growth in the lung by inhibiting heme metabolism and OXPHOS. Targeting heme metabolism and OXPHOS may be an effective strategy to combat lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Resistance to 5-Fluoruracil (5-FU) has been linked to elevated expression of the main target, thymidylate synthase (TYMS), which catalyses the de novo pathway for production of deoxythymidine monophosphate. The potent oncogenic forkhead box transcription factor, FOXM1 is is regulated by E2F1 which also controls TYMS. This study reveals a significant role of FOXM1 in 5-FU resistance. Overexpression and knock-down studies of FOXM1 in colon cancer cells suggest the importance of FOXM1 in TYMS regulation. ChIP and global ChIP-seq data also confirms that FOXM1 can also potentially regulate other 5-FU targets, such as TYMS, thymidine kinase 1 (TK-1) and thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP). In human colorectal cancer tissue specimens, a strong correlation of FOXM1 and TYMS staining was observed. Elevated FOXM1 and TYMS expression was also observed in acquired 5-FU resistant colon cancer cells (HCT116 5-FU Res). A synergistic effect was observed following treatment of CRC cells with an inhibitor of FOXM1, thiostrepton, in combination with 5-FU. The combination treatment decreased colony formation and migration, and induced cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and apoptosis in CRC cell lines. In summary, this research demonstrated that FOXM1 plays a pivotal role in 5-FU resistance at least partially through the regulation of TYMS. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer and has a poor prognosis. miR-302a is an important regulator of tumor occurrence and deterioration, while MAP3K2 and PBX3 genes are involved in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, the expression of miR-302a and MAP3K2/PBX3 were evaluated by qPCR in liver cancer cell lines. Next, the target relationship between miR-302a and MAP3K2/PBX3 was verified using luciferase assays. Meanwhile, the expression correlation between miR-302a and target genes was analyzed in cancer tissue and para-cancerous tissue. In addition, an increased miR-302a level in HepG2 cells and SMMC-7721 cells were achieved through transfection with miR-302a mimics, and the effects on HepG2 cell and SMMC-7721 cell proliferation, apoptosis and MAPK pathways were determined using MTT, flow cytometry, qPCR and western blot assays. The results showed that liver cancer cell lines exhibited low miR-302a expression and MAP3K2 and PBX3 were confirmed to be the target genes of miR-302a. Meanwhile, the HE results showed that cells became enlarged with loose cytoplasm and formed balloon-like lesions in HCC specimens and we found a significant negative correlation between miR-302a and MAP3K2/PBX3 expression. In addition, treatment with miR-302a mimics inhibited HepG2 cells and SMMC-7721 cells proliferation and increased the apoptosis rate. Further research revealed that the MAPK key factors p-p38, p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK were significantly reduced in miR-302a transfected cells and MAP3K2/PBX3 silenced cells. Besides, MAP3K2 and PBX3 overexpression in miR-302a mimics-treated cells exerted the opposite effects. In conclusion, miR-302a inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in human hepatoma cells by targeting MAP3K2 and PBX3. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Halocnemum strobilaceum is a halophyte present in the humid and arid bioclimatic regions of Egypt. The current study aimed at UPLC/PDA/ESI-MS n qualitative chemical profiling of the phyto-constituents underlining both antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of the bio-active fraction in comparison with the other fractions. It resulted in detection of several related compounds to prenylated flavonol icariin as a first report in this species. Results showed that ethyl acetate exhibits an appreciable antioxidant activity using in-vitro DPPH assay with percentage of 82.35% and remarkable anticancer capacity against most common types of cancer in Egypt; breast (MCF-7), human prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines, and human lung carcinoma (A-549) with IC 50 43.1± 2 µg/mL, 115±5 µg/ml, and 53.3±3 µg/mL respectively. These findings point out the appropriate solvent for extraction of the bio-phenolics with this halophyte which is a considerable source of remarkable potential secondary metabolites that exhibit original and interesting anticancer capacity. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

    "Abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of histological type is important for therapy selection in lung cancer. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and histochemical stains are often used to complement morphology for definite diagnosis and are incorporated in the WHO classification. Our main aim was to compare different mucin stains and assess their value in relation to common IHC analyses in lung cancer diagnostics. Using tissue microarrays from 657 surgically treated primary lung cancers, we evaluated the mucin stains periodic acid-Schiff with diastase (PASD), alcian blue–periodic acid-Schiff (ABPAS) and mucicarmine, and compared with the IHC markers p40, p63, cytokeratin 5, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), napsin A and cytokeratin 7. Ten or more cytoplasmic mucin inclusions in a tissue microarray core were seen in 51%, 48% and 31% of the 416 adenocarcinomas and 3%, 4% and 0.5% of the 194 squamous cell carcinomas with PASD, ABPAS and mucicarmine, respectively. Diagnostic pitfalls, such as entrapped benign epithelium, apoptotic/necrotic cells and glycogen, partly differed for the mucin stains. TTF-1 and napsin A IHC stainings had similar specificity but better sensitivity for adenocarcinoma than the mucin stains, but addition of PASD or ABPAS identified more tumors as adenocarcinomas (n = 8 and n = 10, respectively) than napsin A (n = 1) in cases with solid growth that were negative for TTF-1 and p40. We conclude that PASD and ABPAS have similar diagnostic performance and that these markers are of value in poorly differentiated cases. However, morphology and TTF-1 and p40 IHC staining is sufficient for correct diagnosis in most non-small cell lung cancers. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the correlations between diffuse splenic Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and inflammatory markers and to evaluate the prognostic significance of splenic FDG uptake in rectal cancer patients who underwent curative surgery. We retrospectively analyzed the data from 161 patients who underwent splenic FDG PET/CT staging and subsequent curative surgical resection of rectal cancer between July 2006 and September 2014. The spleen-to-liver uptake ratio (S/L ratio) was calculated by dividing the spleen SUV mean by liver SUV mean . We found significant positive correlations between the S/L ratio and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.013) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.007). In a Kaplan–Meier analysis, patients with S/L ratio ≤0.815 had a significantly higher recurrence-free survival rate than those with S/L ratio &gt;0.815 (P = 0.028). Also, patients with S/L ratio ≤0.731 had a significantly higher overall survival rate than those with S/L ratio &gt;0.731 (P = 0.036). In multivariate analysis, higher S/L ratio, as well as male, poor differentiation, higher TNM stage, perineural invasion, and larger tumor size, was independently predictive of cancer recurrence (&gt;0.815 vs ≤0.815, hazard ratio [HR]: 2.04, P = 0.046). With regard to OS, S/L ratio was also an independent prognostic factor for death during follow-up (&gt;0.731 vs ≤0.731, HR: 3.81, P = 0.017). Our results show significant correlations between S/L ratio on PET/CT and systemic inflammatory markers. Further, S/L ratio was an independent prognostic factor for predicting recurrence and death in patient with rectal cancer after curative surgery. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: 68Ga-labeled Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC ([68Ga]PSMA-11) has been increasingly used to image prostate cancer using positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) both during diagnosis and treatment planning. It has been shown to be of clinical value for patients both in the primary and secondary stages of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the effective dose and organ doses from injection of [68Ga]PSMA-11 in a cohort of low-risk prostate cancer patients. Methods: Six low-risk prostate cancer patients were injected with 133–178 MBq [68Ga]PSMA-11 and examined with four PET/CT acquisitions from injection to 255 min post-injection. Urine was collected up to 4 h post-injection, and venous blood samples were drawn at 45 min, 85 min, 175 min, and 245 min post-injection. Kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, salivary and lacrimal glands, and total body where delineated, and cumulated activities and absorbed organ doses calculated. The software IDAC-Dose 2.1 was used to calculate absorbed organ doses according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) publication 107 using specific absorbed fractions published in ICRP 133 and effective dose according to ICRP Publication 103. We also estimated the absorbed dose to the eye lenses using Monte Carlo methods. Results: [68Ga]PSMA-11 was rapidly cleared from the blood and accumulated preferentially in the kidneys and the liver. The substance has a biological half-life in blood of 6.5 min (91%) and 4.4 h (9%). The effective dose was calculated to 0.022 mSv/MBq. The kidneys received approximately 40 mGy after an injection with 160 MBq [68Ga]PSMA-11 while the lacrimal glands obtained an absorbed dose of 0.12 mGy per administered MBq. Regarding the eye lenses, the absorbed dose was low (0.0051 mGy/MBq). Conclusion: The effective dose for [68Ga]PSMA-11 is 0.022 mSv/MBq, where the kidneys and lacrimal glands receiving the highest organ dose. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer worldwide. The mutational frequency of EGFR and KRAS genes in lung adenocarcinoma varies worldwide per ethnicity and smoking. The impact of EGFR and KRAS mutations in Brazilian lung cancer remains poorly explored. Thus, we investigated the frequency of EGFR and KRAS mutations in a large Brazilian series of lung adenocarcinoma together with patients’ genetic ancestry, clinicopathological and sociodemographic characteristics. The mutational frequency of EGFR was 22.7% and KRAS was 20.4%. The average ancestry proportions were 73.1% for EUR, 13.1% for AFR, 6.5% for AME and 7.3% for ASN. EGFR mutations were independently associated with never-smokers, high-Asian ancestry, and better performance status. KRAS mutations were independently associated with tobacco exposure and non-Asian ancestry. EGFR-exon 20 mutations were associated with worse outcome. The Cox regression model indicated a worse outcome for patients whose were older at diagnosis (>61 y), solid histological subtype, loss of weight (>10%), worse performance status (≥2), and presence of KRAS mutations and EGFR mutational status in TKi non-treated patients. In conclusion, we assessed the clinicopathological and ethnic impact of EGFR and KRAS mutations in the largest series reported of Brazilian lung adenocarcinomas. These findings can support future clinical strategies for Brazilian lung cancer patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Red cell distribution width (RDW) to platelet ratio (RPR) is a prognosticator in acute pancreatitis and myocardial infarction; however, the prognostic values of RDW and RPR in breast cancer have not been studied. This retrospective analysis of 299 breast cancer patients investigated the association between RDW and RPR and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis, compared to platelet distribution width to platelet count ratio (PDW/P) which is a known independent prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer. We found a significant correlation between RPR, and age and HER2 status. An elevated RPR significantly correlated with age and HER2 status. After a median follow-up duration of 48 months, tumour size, nuclear grade, PDW/P, and RPR were recgnized to be significantly associated with lower disease-free survival rates (tumour size: p < 0.01; nuclear grade, PDW/P, and RPR: p < 0.05) in univariate analysis. Tumour size and RPR were significant prognostic factors for lower disease-free survival rates, with hazard ratios of 4.31 (95% confidence interval: 1.76–10.53) (p < 0.01)] and 2.79 [95% confidence interval: 1.01–87.69) (p < 0.05)], respectively, in a multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model. This is the first study showing that an elevated RPR could independently predict poor prognosis in patients with breast carcinoma. Thus, RPR could be a novel biomarker for prognostic estimation. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Melatonin is a pleiotropic anti-cancer molecule that controls cancer growth by multiple mechanisms. RNA-Seq can potentially evaluate therapeutic response and its use in xenograft tumor models can differentiate the changes that occur specifically in tumor cells or in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Melatonin actions were evaluated in a xenograft model of triple-negative breast cancer. Balb/c nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumors were treated with melatonin or vehicle. RNA-Seq was performed on the Illumina HiSeq. 2500 and data were mapped against human and mouse genomes separately to differentiate species-specific expression. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to detect clusters of highly co-expressed genes. Melatonin treatment reduced tumor growth (p < 0.01). 57 DE genes were identified in murine cells, which represented the TME, and were mainly involved in immune response. The WGCNA detected co-expressed genes in tumor cells and TME, which were related to the immune system among other biological processes. The upregulation of two genes (Tnfaip8l2 and Il1f6) by melatonin was validated in the TME, these genes play important roles in the immune system. Taken together, the transcriptomic data suggests that melatonin anti-tumor actions occur through modulation of TME in this xenograft tumor model. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Histone methylation is thought to control the regulation of genetic program and the dysregulation of it has been found to be closely associated with cancer. JMJD3 has been identified as an H3K27 demethylase and its role in cancer development is context specific. The role of JMJD3 in gastric cancer (GC) has not been examined. In this study, JMJD3 expression was determined. The prognostic significance of JMJD3 and its association with clinical parameters were evaluated. JMJD3 dysregulation mechanism and targets were analyzed. The effect of JMJD3 mutation was determined by functional study. Results showed that JMJD3 was overexpressed in different patient cohorts and also by bioinformatics analysis. High JMJD3 expression was correlated with shortened overall survival in patients with GC and was an independent prognosis predictor. Genetic aberration and DNA methylation might be involved in the deregulation of JMJD3 in GC. Downstream network of JMJD3 was analyzed and several novel potential targets were identified. Furthermore, functional study discovered that both demethylase-dependent and demethylase-independent mechanisms were involved in the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC. Importantly, histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 could reverse the oncogenic effect of JMJD3 overexpression. In conclusion, our study report the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC for the first time. JMJD3 might serve as an important epigenetic therapeutic target and/or prognostic predictor in GC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this research is to utilize a hybrid system of liposomal doxorubicin (DOX-Lip) loaded thermogel (DOX-Lip-Gel) to realize the steady sustained delivery of doxorubicin (DOX), a small hydrophilic drug, for the treatment of breast cancer locally. Herein, liposomal doxorubicin was prepared via the traditional film dispersion method with the particle size of 75 nm and drug entrapment efficiency of 86%. And, the triblock copolymer of poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide)-b-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly (D, L-lactide -co-glycolide) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) was synthesized via ring-opening polymerization to prepare the thermosensitive hydrogel through dissolving the polymers in DOX-Lip solution. The liposome loaded hydrogel was in a sol state at room temperature and converted into the gel state at body temperature and would degrade gradually during the time in vivo. The drug release of DOX out of DOX-Lip-Gel could be in a steady sustained manner up to 11 days without significant burst release as compared to that of DOX-loaded hydrogel (DOX-Gel). An orthotopic breast cancer model was adopted to evaluate the in vivo antitumor efficacy. And, the results revealed DOX-Lip-Gel had better antitumor efficiency as well as lower side effects.",

    "Abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib are widely used for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but they have shown limited efficacy in an unselected population of patients. The KRAS mutations, which are identified in approximately 20% of NSCLC patients, have shown to be associated with the resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Currently, there is no clinically available targeted therapy which can effectively inhibit NSCLC tumors harboring KRAS mutations. This study aims to show the effectiveness of KYA1797K, a small molecule which revealed anti-cancer effect in colorectal cancer by destabilizing Ras via inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, for the treatment of KRAS-mutated NSCLC. While erlotinib fail to have anti-transforming effect in NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS mutations, KYA1797K effectively inhibited the Ras-ERK pathway in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. As a result, KYA1797K treatment suppressed the growth and transformation of KRAS mutant NSCLC cells and also induced apoptosis. Furthermore, KYA1797K effectively inhibited Kras-driven tumorigenesis in the Kras LA2 mouse model by suppressing the Ras-ERK pathway. The destabilization of Ras via inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutated NSCLC that is resistant to EGFR TKI. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been linked to cancer, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and there is a paucity of reagents to translate this for cancer therapy. Here, we report that an IRE1α RNase-specific inhibitor, MKC8866, strongly inhibits prostate cancer (PCa) tumor growth as monotherapy in multiple preclinical models in mice and shows synergistic antitumor effects with current PCa drugs. Interestingly, global transcriptomic analysis reveal that IRE1α-XBP1s pathway activity is required for c-MYC signaling, one of the most highly activated oncogenic pathways in PCa. XBP1s is necessary for optimal c-MYC mRNA and protein expression, establishing, for the first time, a direct link between UPR and oncogene activation. In addition, an XBP1-specific gene expression signature is strongly associated with PCa prognosis. Our data establish IRE1α-XBP1s signaling as a central pathway in PCa and indicate that its targeting may offer novel treatment strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers in both women and female dogs. Methylation changes of LINE-1 have been reported in human cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the hypomethylation of canine LINE-1 in liquid biopsies for canine mammary tumors (CMT) and to assess its diagnostic performance in human plasma. BC associated LINE-1 methylation was measured by methylation sensitive (HpaII) and insensitive (MspI) restriction enzyme digestion followed by real-time PCR using the cfDNA isolated from 300 µl of plasma. The relative level of methylated canine LINE-1 was less than 0.4 in the benign and malignant CMTs (0.29 ± 0.061 and 0.39 ± 0.066, respectively) when it was 0.92 ± 0.067 in the healthy controls. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was significantly high in both benign and malignant tumors (0.97 and 0.93). Furthermore, this approach was also successfully implemented in a set of 26 human BCs with 10 healthy controls (AUC = 0.78). Altogether, our data suggest that the comparative approach using a dog model might be helpful to rapidly develop a new diagnostic biomarker and that the methylation of LINE-1 in cfDNA may be a good target as a diagnostic marker of both human BC and CMT. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MiR-494 plays an important role in several types of human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although the role of miR-494 has been investigated in several studies, the expression profile and underlying mechanism are still poorly understood. In this study, we found that overexpression of miR-494 promoted the proliferation and colony formation of NSCLC cells and reduced their sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. By using microarray and Dual luciferase reporter assays, we further showed that caspase-2 (CASP2) is a functional target of miR-494, and the expression of CASP2 is inversely associated with miR-494 in vitro. In addition, miR-494 promoted the proliferation and colony formation of NSCLC cells and reduced their sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting CASP2. Therefore, our results suggest that miR-494 plays an oncomiR role in NSCLC cells and may be a candidate biomarker for malignant transformation and a therapeutic target of NSCLC. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Converting carcinomas in benign oncocytomas has been suggested as a potential anti-cancer strategy. One of the oncocytoma hallmarks is the lack of respiratory complex I (CI). Here we use genetic ablation of this enzyme to induce indolence in two cancer types, and show this is reversed by allowing the stabilization of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α). We further show that on the long run CI-deficient tumors re-adapt to their inability to respond to hypoxia, concordantly with the persistence of human oncocytomas. We demonstrate that CI-deficient tumors survive and carry out angiogenesis, despite their inability to stabilize HIF-1α. Such adaptive response is mediated by tumor associated macrophages, whose blockage improves the effect of CI ablation. Additionally, the simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of CI function through metformin and macrophage infiltration through PLX-3397 impairs tumor growth in vivo in a synergistic manner, setting the basis for an efficient combinatorial adjuvant therapy in clinical trials. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The accurate and noninvasive preoperative prediction of the state of the axillary lymph nodes is significant for breast cancer staging, therapy and the prognosis of patients. In this study, we analyzed the possibility of axillary lymph node metastasis directly based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breast in cancer patients. After mass segmentation and feature analysis, the SVM, KNN, and LDA three classifiers were used to distinguish the axillary lymph node state in 5-fold cross-validation. The results showed that the effect of the SVM classifier in predicting breast axillary lymph node metastasis was significantly higher than that of the KNN classifier and LDA classifier. The SVM classifier performed best, with the highest accuracy of 89.54%, and obtained an AUC of 0.8615 for identifying the lymph node status. Each feature was analyzed separately and the results showed that the effect of feature combination was obviously better than that of any individual feature on its own. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human cancers. It thrives in a nutrient-poor environment; however, the mechanisms by which PDAC cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to adapt to metabolic stress are still poorly understood. Here, we show that microRNA-135 is significantly increased in PDAC patient samples compared to adjacent normal tissue. Mechanistically, miR-135 accumulates specifically in response to glutamine deprivation and requires ROS-dependent activation of mutant p53, which directly promotes miR-135 expression. Functionally, we found miR-135 targets phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) and inhibits aerobic glycolysis, thereby promoting the utilization of glucose to support the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Consistently, miR-135 silencing sensitizes PDAC cells to glutamine deprivation and represses tumor growth in vivo. Together, these results identify a mechanism used by PDAC cells to survive the nutrient-poor tumor microenvironment, and also provide insight regarding the role of mutant p53 and miRNA in pancreatic cancer cell adaptation to metabolic stresses. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Different thresholds of Wnt signalling are thought to drive stem cell maintenance, regeneration, differentiation and cancer. However, the principle that oncogenic Wnt signalling could be specifically targeted remains controversial. Here we examine the requirement of BCL9/9l, constituents of the Wnt-enhanceosome, for intestinal transformation following loss of the tumour suppressor APC. Although required for Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells and regeneration, Bcl9/9l deletion has no impact upon normal intestinal homeostasis. Loss of BCL9/9l suppressed many features of acute APC loss and subsequent Wnt pathway deregulation in vivo. This resulted in a level of Wnt pathway activation that favoured tumour initiation in the proximal small intestine (SI) and blocked tumour growth in the colon. Furthermore, Bcl9/9l deletion completely abrogated β-catenin driven intestinal and hepatocellular transformation. We speculate these results support the just-right hypothesis of Wnt–driven tumour formation. Importantly, loss of BCL9/9l is particularly effective at blocking colonic tumourigenesis and mutations that most resemble those that occur in human cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The five-year survival rate of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is approximately 35–40% despite maximal treatment efforts, highlighting a need for stratification biomarkers for personalized treatment. Here we extract 657 quantitative mathematical descriptors from the preoperative CT images of 364 EOC patients at their initial presentation. Using machine learning, we derive a non-invasive summary-statistic of the primary ovarian tumor based on 4 descriptors, which we name “Radiomic Prognostic Vector” (RPV). RPV reliably identifies the 5% of patients with median overall survival less than 2 years, significantly improves established prognostic methods, and is validated in two independent, multi-center cohorts. Furthermore, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis from two independent datasets elucidate that stromal phenotype and DNA damage response pathways are activated in RPV-stratified tumors. RPV and its associated analysis platform could be exploited to guide personalized therapy of EOC and is potentially transferrable to other cancer types. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) remains a major clinical problem. Approximately 10–16% of patients with breast cancer develop brain metastases (BCBM). However, no systemic therapy has gained regulatory approval for the specific treatment of BCBM and this remains an area of persistent, unmet medical need. Rapid, predictive and clinically-relevant animal models are critical to study the biology of brain metastases and to identify effective therapeutic approaches for patients with BCBM. Here, we describe a method for efficient establishment of orthotopic mouse models of patient-derived brain metastases via an improved intracarotid injection protocol that permits tumor cell growth in the unique brain microenvironment without compromising the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrate that our newly improved models of patient-derived brain metastases recapitulate the histologic, molecular, and genetic characteristics of their matched patient tumor specimens and thus represent a potentially powerful tool for pre-clinical and translational research. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A novel EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), osimertinib, has marked efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. However, some patients show intrinsic resistance and an insufficient response to osimertinib. This study showed that osimertinib stimulated AXL by inhibiting a negative feedback loop. Activated AXL was associated with EGFR and HER3 in maintaining cell survival and inducing the emergence of cells tolerant to osimertinib. AXL inhibition reduced the viability of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cells overexpressing AXL that were exposed to osimertinib. The addition of an AXL inhibitor during either the initial or tolerant phases reduced tumor size and delayed tumor re-growth compared to osimertinib alone. AXL was highly expressed in clinical specimens of EGFR-mutated lung cancers and its high expression was associated with a low response rate to EGFR-TKI. These results indicated pivotal roles for AXL and its inhibition in the intrinsic resistance to osimertinib and the emergence of osimertinib-tolerant cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Wilms tumor gene on the X chromosome (WTX) is a putative tumor suppressor gene in Wilms tumor, but its expression and functions in other tumors are unclear. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women and the second leading cause in men in the United States. We demonstrated that WTX frequently lost in CRC which was highly correlated with cell proliferation, tumor invasion and metastasis. Mechanistically, WTX loss disrupts the interaction between RhoGDIα and CDC42 by losing of the binding with RhoGDIα and triggers the activation of CDC42 and its downstream cascades, which promotes CRC development and liver metastasis. The aberrant upregulation of miR-20a/miR-106a were identified as the reason of WTX loss in CRC both in vivo and in vitro. These study defined the mechanism how miR-20a/miR-106a-mediated WTX loss regulates CRC progression and metastasis, and provided a potential therapeutic target for preventing CRC progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Telomere length (TL) in offspring is positively correlated with paternal age at the time of the offspring conception. The paternal-age-at-conception (PAC) effect on TL is puzzling, and its biological implication at the population level is unknown. Using a probabilistic model of transgenerational TL and population dynamics, we simulated the effect of PAC on TL in individuals over the course of 1,000 years. Findings suggest a key role for an isometric PAC midpoint (PACmp) in modulating TL across generations, such that offspring conceived by males younger than the isometric PACmp have comparatively short telomeres, while offspring conceived by males older than the isometric PACmp have comparatively long telomeres. We further show that when cancer incidence escalates, the average PAC drops below the isometric PACmp and transgenerational adaptation to cancer ensues through TL shortening. We propose that PAC serves to maintain an optimal TL across generations. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Penile cancer belongs to group of relatively rare malignancies. It represents, on average, 0.5-1% of all tumours in males globally and occurs predominantly in older individuals (&gt; 65 years). The geographical distribution of malignant cancer of the penis is reported. A higher incidence is observed in less developed parts of the world, particularly in South America, Southeast Asia, and some areas of Africa (&gt; 2.0/100,000). In Slovakia, there has been a recent increase in incidence (1.1/100,000 in 2011). Mortality has stabilized at 0.3/100,000 in recent years. Significant risk factors for malignant cancers include social and cultural habits and hygienic and religious practices. Important risk factors are inadequate hygiene of the foreskin sac, phimosis, human papillomavirus infection, sexual promiscuity, smoking, genital infections, and a low socio-economic and educational status. PURPOSE: The present paper provides an overview of pathology, symptomatology, diagnostic approaches, and classification of the extent of the disease. Treatment of the primary tumour depends on the extent of the disease and includes topical treatment, photodynamic treatment, cryoablation, laser photocoagulation, conservative surgical treatment, especially circumcision, and even radical treatment - penile amputation with perineal urethrostomy. An important part of the management of this malignancy is surgical treatment of metastases in inguinal lymph nodes. The article devotes more attention to non-surgical treatment modalities, in particular radiotherapy (external and brachytherapy) and systemic therapy (chemotherapy and biologic therapy), offering an overview of the indications and regimens in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant and palliative approaches, with and without concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and describes possible adverse effects of the treatments.  Conclusion: Patients with penile cancer should be concentrated in centres that have abundant experience in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.

    "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play a key role during the metastatic process of human cancers and their reliable detection and characterization could enable new and effective ways of cancer diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. However, due to their ultralow concentration in patient blood, the CTCs must first be enriched before such analysis can be performed. Classical microfiltration is an important and widely used method for the mechanical enrichment of CTCs. This method exploits that CTCs are generally larger than the accompanying blood cells, however, does not differentiate the cells in other ways. In an affinity filtration, selectivity is added by functionalizing the membrane with specific antibodies against a CTC-characteristic surface protein such as the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). A common shortcoming of both filtration approaches is that there is still a poor understanding of the enrichment process and the systems developed so far are frequently operated under non-optimized conditions. To address this, systematic filtration experiments are performed in this work using the EpCAM + cell line MCF-7 as CTC-model and standard track-etched membranes modified with or without antibodies against EpCAM. The influences of the key filtration parameters time and applied pressure are studied and it is found that in all cases the extent of cell recovery is limited by a lysis process which occurs on the membrane surface. Counterintuitively, it is found that filtration at rather high pressures is advantageous to ensure high recovery rates. To describe the pressure-induced lysis process a biophysical model is developed. This model allows the determination of optimum filtration conditions to achieve both high cancer cell recovery and large blood sample throughput. It is demonstrated that this way practically 100% of spiked cancer cells can be recovered from milliliters of undiluted whole blood within seconds. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Although the protumoral functions of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are well known, some now-forgotten studies report antitumoral roles for these cells. The present work examines the antitumoral effect of maintained neutrophilia induced via the injection of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 100 μg/kg/day) in a Panc-1 subcutaneous xenograft murine model of pancreatic cancer. This treatment was compared with gemcitabine administration (120 mg/kg every two days) and a saline control (n = 6–7 mice per group). Compared to the controls, both the rhG-CSF- and gemcitabine-treated mice showed significantly suppressed tumor growth by day 4 (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.013 respectively). From a mean starting volume of 106.9 ± 3.1 mm 3 for all treatment groups, the final mean tumor volumes reached were 282.0 ± 30.7 mm 3 for the rhG-CSF-treated mice, 202.6 ± 18.1 mm 3 for the gemcitabine-treated mice and 519.4 ± 62.9 mm 3 for the control mice (p &lt; 0.004 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively, vs. control). The rhG-CSF-treated tumors showed higher percentage necrosis than those treated with gemcitabine (37.4 ± 4.6 vs. 7.5 ± 3.0; p &lt; 0.001). This is the first report of a clear anti-tumoral effect of rhG-CSF when used in monotherapy against pancreatic cancer. Since rhG-CSF administration is known to be associated with very few adverse events, it may offer an attractive alternative in the clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are often found as small lesions, which can be treated by endoscopic resection. However, high risk cases with lymph node (LN) metastasis are indication of radical surgery. Furthermore, rectal NETs are often associated with late recurrences and/or multiple cancer development. Therefore, proper surgical indication and patients’ management are required. We investigated the clinicopathological features of 79 rectal NET cases in order to elucidate risk factors for synchronous LN metastasis, recurrence, and multiple cancers. Recently, we reported that in pancreatic NET patients, a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in PHLDA3 was associated with poorer prognosis, and that LOH of both PHLDA3 and MEN1 was frequently observed. Therefore, PHLDA3 and MEN1 LOH were also assessed in rectal NET patients for their association with clinicopathological features. Of the 79 patients, LN metastases were found in 12.7%, recurrences in 3.8%, and multiple cancers in 30.4% of the subjects. PHLDA3 and MEN1 LOH were found in 60.0% and 66.7% of the subjects, respectively. Lymphatic invasion and WHO classification 2010 were found to be independent risks for LN metastasis. There were three cases of recurrence, all of which occurred more than 3 years after resection and two of which exhibited LN metastasis. Older age and LOH in PHLDA3 were associated with the presence of multiple cancers. Long-term and systemic management of patients with rectal NETs is therefore recommended in accordance with these risk factors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Cooking-related emissions are associated with environmental pollution and adverse health effects. Of the various chemical species emitted during cooking, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aldehydes are two chemical species with carcinogenic or tumor promoting characteristics. Although PAH exposure has been studied in commercial kitchen workers, few studies have investigated simultaneous exposure to PAHs and aldehydes in these workers. The aims of this study were to compare personal concentrations of PAH and aldehyde in three commercial cooking workplaces and to estimate their corresponding cancer risks. The three cooking workplaces included western fast food restaurant kitchens, Chinese cafeteria kitchens, and street food carts. Comparisons showed that workers in western fast food restaurant kitchens and Chinese cafeteria kitchens tended to have lower personal concentrations of these pollutants compared to workers in street food carts. The geometric mean (95% CI) cancer risks in the three workplaces were, from lowest to highest, 1.36 (1.12–1.67) × 10 −5 for western fast food restaurant kitchens, 1.52 (1.01–2.28) × 10 −5 for Chinese cafeteria kitchens, and 3.14 (2.45–4.01) × 10 −5 for street food carts. The percentage contributions of aldehyde species to cancer risk were very high (74.9–99.7%). Street food cart workers had high personal exposure to aldehyde probably due to lack of effective exhaust systems. Thus, their cancer risk was significantly higher than those of workers in western fast food restaurant kitchens (p &lt; 0.001) and Chinese cafeteria kitchens (p = 0.013). © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma are serious human diseases. Here, we examined the in vivo and in vitro inhibitory effect of extracts of Qizhu decoction (a traditional Chinese medicine) on hepatitis caused by diethylnitrosamine or hepatitis B virus and on diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. The results showed that both the aqueous and ethanol extracts (QC and QS, respectively) of Qizhu decoction significantly inhibited hepatic inflammation and liver cancer induced by diethylnitrosamine or hepatitis B virus by suppressing NF-κB signaling and decreasing the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. Both QC and QS inhibited the proliferation and migration of primary cancer hepatocytes by reducing cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and N-cadherin expression and increasing E-cadherin expression. QC and QS also promoted the apoptosis of primary cancer hepatocytes by upregulating caspase-3 and downregulating BCL-2 expression. The knockdown of p65 in NF-κB signaling inhibited the ability of QC and QS to significantly reduce the colony formation ability of liver cancer cells. Additionally, QC and QS might significantly inhibit the DNA replication of hepatitis B virus in vivo and in vitro, and we found that corilagin and polydatin were the active compounds of QC and QS. Taken together, our in vitro findings and our results in C57BL/6 mice showed that extracts of Qizhu decoction might inhibit hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma by suppressing NF-κB signaling. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We focused on the biomechanical and morphological characteristics of prostate cancer cells and their changes resulting from the effect of docetaxel, cisplatin, and long-term zinc supplementation. Cell population surviving the treatment was characterized as follows: cell stiffness was assessed by atomic force microscopy, cell motility and invasion capacity were determined by colony forming assay, wound healing assay, coherence-controlled holographic microscopy, and real-time cell analysis. Cells of metastatic origin exhibited lower height than cells derived from the primary tumour. Cell dry mass and CAV1 gene expression followed similar trends as cell stiffness. Docetaxel- and cisplatin-surviving cells had higher stiffness, and decreased motility and invasive potential as compared to non-treated cells. This effect was not observed in zinc(II)-treated cells. We presume that cell stiffness changes may represent an important overlooked effect of cisplatin-based anti-cancer drugs.

    "Abstract": "Cancer progression involves complex signals within the tumor microenvironment that orchestrate proliferation and invasive processes. The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within this microenvironment has been demonstrated to influence growth and the migratory phenotype that precedes invasion. Here we present the integration of a label-free quantitative phase imaging technique, spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM)—with protein-conjugated hydrogel substrates—to explore how the stiffness of the ECM influences melanoma cells of varying metastatic potential. Melanoma cells of high metastatic potential demonstrate increased growth and velocity characteristics relative to cells of low metastatic potential. Cell velocity in the highly metastatic population shows a relative insensitivity to matrix stiffness suggesting adoption of migratory routines that are independent of mechanics to facilitate invasion. The use of SLIM and engineered substrates provides a new approach to characterize the invasive properties of live cells as a function of microenvironment parameters. This work provides fundamental insight into the relationship between growth, migration and metastatic potential, and provides a new tool for profiling cancer cells for clinical grading and development of patient-specific therapeutic regimens. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tandem satellite repeats account for 3% of the human genome. One of them, Human Satellite II (HSATII), is highly expressed in several epithelial cancers and cancer cell lines. Here we report an acute induction of HSATII RNA in human cells infected with two herpes viruses. We show that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 and IE2 proteins cooperate to induce HSATII RNA affecting several aspects of the HCMV replication cycle, viral titers and infected-cell processes. HSATII RNA expression in tissue from two chronic HCMV colitis patients correlates with the strength of CMV antigen staining. Thus, endogenous HSATII RNA synthesis after herpesvirus infections appears to have functionally important consequences for viral replication and may provide a novel insight into viral pathogenesis. The HSATII induction seen in both infected and cancer cells suggests possible convergence upon common HSATII-based regulatory mechanisms in these seemingly disparate diseases. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Owing to their self-organizing evolutionary plasticity, cancers remain evasive to modern treatment strategies. Previously, for sensitizing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-resistant human fibrosarcoma (HT1080), we developed and validated a dynamic computational model that showed the inhibition of protein kinase (PK)C, using bisindolylmaleimide (BIS) I, enhances apoptosis with 95% cell death. Although promising, the long-term effect of remaining ~ 5% cells is a mystery. Will they remain unchanged or are they able to proliferate? To address this question, here we adopted a discrete spatiotemporal cellular automata model utilizing simple rules modified from the famous “Conway’s game of life”. Based on three experimental initializations: cell numbers obtained from untreated (high), treatment with TRAIL only (moderate), and treatment with TRAIL and BIS I (low), the simulations show cell proliferation in time and space. Notably, when all cells are fixed in their initial space, the proliferation is rapid for high and moderate cell numbers, however, slow and steady for low number of cells. However, when mesenchymal-like random movement was introduced, the proliferation becomes significant even for low cell numbers. Experimental verification showed high proportion of mesenchymal cells in TRAIL and BIS I treatment compared with untreated or TRAIL only treatment. In agreement with the model with cell movement, we observed rapid proliferation of the remnant cells in TRAIL and BIS I treatment over time. Hence, our work highlights the importance of mesenchymal-like cellular movement for cancer proliferation. Nevertheless, re-treatment of TRAIL and BIS I on proliferating cancers is still largely effective. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Little has been published on the diagnostic and referral pathway for lung cancer in Australia. This study set out to quantify general practitioner (GP) and lung specialist attendance and diagnostic imaging in the lead-up to a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and identify common pathways to diagnosis in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We used linked health data for participants of the 45 and Up Study (a NSW population-based cohort study) diagnosed with NSCLC between 2006 and 2012. Our main outcome measures were GP and specialist attendances, X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and lung cancer-related hospital admissions. Among our study cohort (N = 894), 60% (n = 536) had ≥4 GP attendances in the 3 months prior to diagnosis of NSCLC, 56% (n = 505) had GP-ordered imaging (chest X-ray or CT scan), 39% (N = 349) attended a respiratory physician and 11% (N = 102) attended a cardiothoracic surgeon. The two most common pathways to diagnosis, accounting for one in three people, included GP and lung specialist (respiratory physician or cardiothoracic surgeon) involvement. Overall, 25% of people (n = 223) had an emergency hospital admission. For 14% of people (N = 129), an emergency hospital admission was the only event identified on the pathway to diagnosis. We found little effect of remoteness of residence on access to services. This study identified a substantial proportion of people with NSCLC being diagnosed in an emergency setting. Further research is needed to establish whether there were barriers to the timely diagnosis of these cases. © 2019, Crown.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Pelvic exenteration (PE) is indicated in cases of unresponsive, recurrent pelvic cancer or for palliative intent. Despite the fact that the surgery is associated with a high rate of morbidity, it is currently the only real option that can effect a cure. Material and methods: Patients who underwent PE between January 2011 and July 2017 in our centre were retrospectively reviewed. Data related to surgery, complications and outcomes were recorded. Results: Twenty-three patients were included. PE was performed due to recurrent gynaecological cancer, persistence of disease and after first diagnosis in 19 (82%), 2 (9%) and 2 patients (9%), respectively. Total PE was performed in 15 cases (65%), followed by anterior PE in 5 cases (22%) and posterior PE in 3 cases (13%). Early grade II, III and IV complications occurred in 15 (65%), 5 (22%) and 2 patients (9%), respectively. No mortality was observed within 30 days. Medium-late grade II, III, IV and V complications occurred in 15 (65%), 11 (48%), 3 (13%) and 2 cases (9%), respectively. Two patients died after > 30-day period from surgery-related complications. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 48 months after PE was 41.6% and 30.8% respectively. Conclusions: PE provides about a 40% 4-year survival chance in a selected group of patients. The early-complications rate and 30-day mortality were acceptable. Nevertheless, the medium-late complication grades II–V were 65, 48, 18 and 9%, respectively. We must focus on identifying those patients who could potentially benefit most from PE. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "c-Src is a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase that has key roles in the signaling transduction that controls cell growth, adhesion, and migration. In the early stage of carcinogenesis, c-Src is activated under the plasma membrane and transduces oncogenic signals. Here we show that c-Src localized to the endosomal membrane has unique functions in c-Src–transformed cells. Our results indicate that activated c-Src in the endosomal membrane promoted the secretion of exosomes, in which c-Src was encapsulated. In addition, the ESCRT-interacting molecule, Alix was identified as a c-Src–interacting protein in exosomes. We revealed that the interaction between the SH3 domain of c-Src and the proline-rich region of Alix activates ESCRT–mediated intra-luminal vesicle (ILV) formation, resulting in the upregulation of exosome secretion in c-Src–transformed cells. We observed also a correlation between malignant phenotypes and Alix–dependent aberrant exosome secretion in Src–upregulated cancer cells. Collectively, our findings provide a unique mechanism for the upregulation of exosomes in cancer cells, as well as new insights into the significance of exosome secretion in cancer progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In the recent years, cancer research succeeded with sensitive detection methods, targeted drug delivery systems, and the identification of a large set of genes differently expressed. However, although most therapies are still based on antimitotic agents, which are causing wide secondary effects, there is an increasing interest for metabolic therapies that can minimize side effects. In the early 20 th century, Otto Warburg revealed that cancer cells rely on the cytoplasmic fermentation of glucose to lactic acid for energy synthesis (called “Warburg effect”). Our investigations aim to reverse this effect in reprogramming cancer cells’ metabolism. In this work, we present a metabolic therapy specifically targeting the activity of specific enzymes of central carbon metabolism, combining the METABLOC bi-therapeutic drugs combination (Alpha Lipoic Acid and Hydroxycitrate) to Metformin and Diclofenac, for treating tumors implanted in mice. Furthermore, a dynamic metabolic model describing central carbon metabolism as well as fluxes targeted by the drugs allowed to simulate tumors progression in both treated and non-treated mice, in addition to draw hypotheses on the effects of the drugs on tumor cells metabolism. Our model predicts metabolic therapies-induced reversed Warburg effect on tumor cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We report a design and fabricate multifunctional localized platform for cancer therapy. Multiple stimuli-responsive polydopamine (PDA) was used for surface modification of electrospun doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers to make a designated platform. Photothermal properties such as photothermal performance and stability of the resulting composite mats were studied under the irradiation of the near-infrared (NIR) laser of 808 nm. With the incorporation of PDA into the fiber, a remarkable increase of local temperature was recorded under NIR illumination in a concentration-dependent manner with excellent stability. Drug released assay results revealed PDA coated PCL-DOX mats showed pH and NIR dual responsive behavior thereby exhibiting improved drug release in an acidic medium compared to physiological pH condition (pH 7.4) which is further increased by NIR exposure. The cancer activity in vitro of the mats was evaluated using cell counting (CCK) and live and dead cell assays. The combined effect of NIR mediated hyperthermia and chemo release resulting improved cells death has been reported. In summary, this study presents a major step forward towards a therapeutic model to cancer treatment utilizing pH and NIR dual responsive property from PDA alone in a fibrous mat. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The tumors of the peritoneal surface, both primary and secondary, are associated with a very poor prognosis and rapid progression through conventional oncology treatment including systemic chemotherapy, targeted treatment, radiotherapy, surgery, and symptomatic treatment. Until recently, most of them were considered incurable. In the 1980s, the first cytoreductive surgery (\"CRS\") combined with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (\"HIPEC\") became the standard of treatment for selected tumor peritoneal tumor (pseudomyxoma peritonei and primary peritoneal malignant mesothelioma). In some cases of other peritoneal carcinomatosis associated with colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and ovarian cancer in the subgroup of well selected patients, this treatment can lead to a significant prolongation of overall survival and good standard of quality of life. This method is safe in specialized centers with an acceptable rate of morbidity and mortality comparable to foreign workplaces and is also available for patients in the Czech Republic.

    "Abstract": "Deguelin is a major active ingredient and principal component in several plants and it is a potential molecule to target proteins of cancer cell signaling pathway. As a complex natural extract, deguelin interacts with various molecular targets to exert its anti-tumor properties at nanomolar level. It induces cell apoptosis by blocking anti-apoptotic pathways, while inhibiting tumor cell multiplication and malignant transformation through p27-cyclin-E-pRb-E2F1- cell cycle control and HIF-1alphaVEGF antiangiogenic pathways. In silico studies of deguelin and its derivatives is performed to explore interactions with Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E to understand the molecular insights of derivatives with the receptors. Deguelin and its derivatives are minimized by Avogadro to achieve stable conformation. All docking simulation are performed with AutoDockVina and virtual screening of docked ligands are carried out based on binding energy and number of hydrogen bonds. Molecular dynamics (MD) and Simulation of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 is performed for 100 ns and stable conformation is obtained at 78 ns and 19 ns respectively. Ligands thus obtained from docking studies may be probable target to inhibit cancer cell signaling pathways. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been revealed to play vital roles in modulating gene expression and participate in several pathological responses including gastric cancer (GC). However, the larger numbers of the circRNAs in GC progression remain undetermined. In the present study, four GC related circRNAs expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were enrolled. We identified hsa_ circRNA_00067997 (circ_0067997) as an oncogene in GC. qRT-PCR was used to validate the expression of circ_0067997 in GC tissues and cell lines. The results revealed that circ_0067997 was upregulated in GC, and high circ_0067997 expression was associated with the poor overall survival rate of GC patients. Knockdown of circ_0067997 significantly reduced cell viability, inhibited colony formation, and attenuated invasive ability, whereas overexpression of circ_0067997 exhibited opposed effects. Circ_0067997 was identified to be a sponge for miR-515-5p directly. Moreover, XIAP was demonstrated to be targeted and regulated by miR-515-5p. In conclusion, circ_0067997 was identified to be an oncogene in GC by regulating miR-515-5p/XIAP axis.",

    "Abstract": "Two cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes, trans-[Co(salen)(DA) 2 ](ClO 4 ) (1) and trans-[Co(salophen)(DA) 2 ](ClO 4 ) (2) (where salen: N,N’-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine, salopen: N,N’-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-phenylenediamine, DA: dodecylamine) were synthesised and characterised using various spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The binding affinity of both the complexes with CT-DNA was explored adopting UV-visible, fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry techniques. The results revealed that both the complexes interacted with DNA via intercalation as well as notable groove binding. Protein (BSA) binding ability of these complexes was investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopy which indicate that these complexes engage in strong hydrophobic interaction with BSA. The mode of interaction between these complexes and CT-DNA/BSA was studied by molecular docking analysis. The in vitro cytotoxic property of the complexes was evaluated in A549 (human small cell lung carcinoma) and VERO (African green monkey kidney cells). The results revealed that the complexes affect viability of the cells. AO and EB staining and cell cycle analysis revealed that the mode of cell death is apoptosis. Both the complexes showed profound inhibition of angiogenesis as revealed in in-vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Of the two complexes, the complex 2 proved to be much more efficient in affecting the viability of lung cancer cells than complex 1. These results indicate that the cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes in this study can be potentially used for cancer chemotherapy and as inhibitor of angiogenesis, in general, and lung cancer in particular, for which there is need for substantiation at the level of signalling mechanisms and gene expressions. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Unresectable pancreatic cancer is almost universally lethal because chemotherapy and radiation cannot completely stop the growth of the cancer. The major problem with using radiation to approximate surgery in unresectable disease is that the radiation dose required to ablate pancreatic cancer exceeds the tolerance of the nearby duodenum. WR-2721, also known as amifostine, is a well-known radioprotector, but has significant clinical toxicities when given systemically. WR-2721 is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite, WR-1065, by alkaline phosphatases in normal tissues. The small intestine is highly enriched in these activating enzymes, and thus we reasoned that oral administration of WR-2721 just before radiation would result in localized production of the radioprotective WR-1065 in the small intestine, providing protective benefits without the significant systemic side effects. Here, we show that oral WR-2721 is as effective as intraperitoneal WR-2721 in promoting survival of intestinal crypt clonogens after morbid irradiation. Furthermore, oral WR-2721 confers full radioprotection and survival after lethal upper abdominal irradiation of 12.5 Gy × 5 fractions (total of 62.5 Gy, EQD2 = 140.6 Gy). This radioprotection enables ablative radiation therapy in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer and nearly triples the median survival compared to controls. We find that the efficacy of oral WR-2721 stems from its selective accumulation in the intestine, but not in tumors or other normal tissues, as determined by in vivo mass spectrometry analysis. Thus, we demonstrate that oral WR-2721 is a well-tolerated, and quantitatively selective, radioprotector of the intestinal tract that is capable of enabling clinically relevant ablative doses of radiation to the upper abdomen without unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BRCA1-mutated breast cancer is primarily driven by DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) containing large numbers of candidate driver genes. Validation of these candidates requires novel approaches for high-throughput in vivo perturbation of gene function. Here we develop genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of BRCA1-deficient breast cancer that permit rapid introduction of putative drivers by either retargeting of GEMM-derived embryonic stem cells, lentivirus-mediated somatic overexpression or in situ CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption. We use these approaches to validate Myc, Met, Pten and Rb1 as bona fide drivers in BRCA1-associated mammary tumorigenesis. Iterative mouse modeling and comparative oncogenomics analysis show that MYC-overexpression strongly reshapes the CNA landscape of BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors and identify MCL1 as a collaborating driver in these tumors. Moreover, MCL1 inhibition potentiates the in vivo efficacy of PARP inhibition (PARPi), underscoring the therapeutic potential of this combination for treatment of BRCA1-mutated cancer patients with poor response to PARPi monotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, with metastatic melanoma being refractory to currently available conventional therapies. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of coronatine (COR) on the proliferation of metastatic melanoma cells. COR inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells but negligibly affected the proliferation of normal melanocytes. Comparative metabolic and lipidomic profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and direct infusion-mass spectrometry was performed to investigate COR-induced metabolic changes. These analyses identified 33 metabolites and 82 lipids. Of these, the levels of lactic acid and glutamic acid, which are involved in energy metabolism, significantly decreased in COR-treated melanoma cells. Lipidomic profiling indicated that ceramide levels increased in COR-treated melanoma cells, suggesting that ceramides could function as a suppressor of cancer cell proliferation. In contrast, the levels of phosphatidylinositol (PI) species, including PI 16:0/18:0, 16:0/18:1, 18:0/18:0, and 18:0/18:1, which were found to be potential biomarkers of melanoma metastasis in our previous study, were lower in the COR-treated cells than in control cells. The findings of metabolomic and lipidomic profiling performed in the present study provide new insights on the anticancer mechanisms of COR and can be used to apply COR in cancer treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy is used in >50% of patients with cancer, both for curative and palliative purposes. Radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation to target and kill tumour tissue, but normal tissue can also be damaged, leading to toxicity. Modern and precise radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, may prevent toxicity, but some patients still experience adverse effects. The physiopathology of toxicity is dependent on many parameters, such as the location of irradiation or the functional status of organs at risk. Knowledge of the mechanisms leads to a more rational approach for controlling radiotherapy toxicity, which may result in improved symptom control and quality of life for patients. This improved quality of life is particularly important in paediatric patients, who may live for many years with the long-term effects of radiotherapy. Notably, signs and symptoms occurring after radiotherapy may not be due to the treatment but to an exacerbation of existing conditions or to the development of new diseases. Although differential diagnosis may be difficult, it has important consequences for patients. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between metformin and prostate cancer (PCa) remains controversial. To clarify this association, the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched from their inception dates to May 23, 2018, using the keywords “metformin” and “prostate cancer” to identify the related studies. The results included incidence, overall survival (OS), PCa-specific survival (CSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), which were measured as hazard ratios (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using Review Manager 5.3 software. A total of 30 cohort studies, including 1,660,795 patients were included in this study. Our study revealed that metformin treatment improves OS, CSS and RFS in PCa (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59–0.88, P = 0.001; HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.64–0.94, P = 0.009; and HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42–0.87 P = 0.006, respectively) compared with non-metformin treatment. However, metformin usage did not reduce the incidence of PCa (HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.55–1.34, P = 0.51). In conclusion, compared with non-metformin treatment, metformin therapy can significantly improve OS, CSS and RFS in PCa patients. No association was noted between metformin therapy and PCa incidence. This study indicates a useful direction for the clinical treatment of PCa. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Bladder cancer (BC) is heterogeneous and expresses various cell surface targets. Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) involves monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) conjugated to a photoabsorber (PA), IR Dye 700Dx, and then activated by near infra-red light (NIR) to specifically target tumors. We have demonstrated that tumors expressing EGFR can be targeted with PIT. However, PIT may be less effective when a tumor lacks “overwhelming” expression of a single target such as EGFR. We present a combinatorial PIT approach for targeting BC expressing EGFR and HER2, using PA- labeled panitumumab (pan) and trastuzumab (tra), respectively. Human BC tissues and cell lines were analyzed for EGFR and HER2 expression. Efficacy of PA-labeled MAbs singly and in combination was analyzed. About 45% of BC tissues stain for both EGFR and HER2. In vitro, the combination of pan IR700 and tra IR700 with NIR was more efficacious than either agent alone. Tumor xenografts treated with combination PIT showed significant tumor growth retardation. Combination PIT is a promising approach for treating BC with low/moderate expression of surface receptors. In addition, given the molecular heterogeneity of bladder cancer, targeting more than one surface receptor may allow for more effective cell death across different bladder tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The proto-oncoprotein MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a key role in cancer cell growth and invasion. We have used fluorescence-tagged antibodies to activate MET in live serum-starved glioblastoma cells and monitor the fate of antibody-bound MET receptor in single cell-based assays. We found that the antibodies induced rapid and transient formation of highly polarized MET clusters on the plasma membrane and promoted the activation of MET, resembling the initial effects of binding to its ligand, HGF. However, the antibody-induced clustering and activation of MET led to the rapid removal of the receptor from cell surface and altered its intracellular processing, resulted in rapid degradation of the receptor. Consequently, while cells pre-treated with HGF remain competent to respond to further HGF stimulation, cells pre-treated with antibodies are refractory to further HGF stimulation due to antibody-mediated MET depletion. Removal of MET by sustained treatment of antibodies blocked cancer cell migration and invasion. Our studies reveal a novel mechanism to alter the recycling process of MET in glioblastoma cancer cells by promoting the receptor degradation through a proteasome-sensitive and lysosome-dependent pathway through the ligand-independent activation of MET using anti-MET antibodies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Hypoxia-related gene (HRG) expression is associated with survival outcomes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Our aim was developing a nomogram predicting CRC overall survival (OS) with HRGs and clinicopathological factors. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used as discovery cohort and two Gene Expression Omnibus databases (GSE39582 and GSE41258) served as validation cohorts. A genetic risk score model prognosticating OS was developed using mRNA expression level of HRGs. Nomogram predicting OS was developed using genetic risk score model and clinicopathological variables. The genetic risk score model included four HRGs (HSPA1L, PUM1, UBE2D2, and HSP27) and successfully prognosticated OS of discovery and two validation cohorts (p < 0.001 for TCGA discovery set, p < 0.003 for the GSE39582 and p = 0.042 for the GSE41258 datasets). Nomogram included genetic risk score, age, and TNM stage. Harrell’s concordance indexes of the nomogram were higher than those of TNM stage alone in the discovery set (0.77 vs. 0.69, p < 0.001), GSE39582 (0.65 vs. 0.63, p < 0.001), and GSE41258 datasets (0.78 vs. 0.77, p < 0.001). Our nomogram successfully predicted OS of CRC patients. The mRNA expression level of the HRGs might be useful as an ancillary marker for prognosticating CRC outcome. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "PARP inhibitors have been proven clinically efficacious in platinum-responsive ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA1/2 status and in breast cancers with germline BRCA1/2 mutation. However, resistance to PARP inhibitors may preexist or evolve during treatment in many cancer types and may be overcome by combining PARP inhibitors with other therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which confer durable responses and are rapidly becoming the standard of care for multiple tumor types. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of combining niraparib, a highly selective PARP1/2 inhibitor, with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical tumor models. Our results indicate that niraparib treatment increases the activity of the type I (alpha) and type II (gamma) interferon pathways and enhances the infiltration of CD8 + cells and CD4 + cells in tumors. When coadministered in immunocompetent models, the combination of niraparib and anti-PD-1 demonstrated synergistic antitumor activities in both BRCA-proficient and BRCA-deficient tumors. Interestingly, mice with tumors cured by niraparib monotherapy completely rejected tumor growth upon rechallenge with the same tumor cell line, suggesting the potential establishment of immune memory in animals treated with niraparib monotherapy. Taken together, our findings uncovered immunomodulatory effects of niraparib that may sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Serum neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) is a potential predictive and prognostic marker in head and neck cancers. This study aimed to determine the role of pretreatment serum NLR in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. We retrospectively investigated the correlation between clinicopathological parameters and NLR status and analysed its impact on therapeutic response and survival. A total of 120 patients treated at a single institution between 2009 and 2015 were included. The median follow-up time was 24.1 months. High NLR (NLR ≥ 4) was associated with advanced T classification (p = 0.01*) and advanced stage (p = 0.02*) based on chi-square test. We also found that high pretreatment NLR was correlated with poor treatment response (HR = 2.42, 95% CI: 1.08–5.44, p = 0.03*). Pretreatment NLR was also an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (HR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.01–2.90, p = 0.046*) and overall survival (HR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.21–3.28, p = 0.01*) while correcting for known prognostic factors. Overall, these findings support that NLR is a potential biomarker for host response to tumour aggressiveness, therapeutic response to chemoradiotherapy and survival in HPC patients. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and further validation is warranted. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "It is important that questionnaires are as short as possible while still capturing the scope of problems relevant in an effective and reliable manner, to minimize the response burden. The purpose of our study was to develop a shortened version of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 for using in breast cancer survivors. Our data come from 10794 breast cancer survivors who completed the EORTC QLQ-BR23. Two-thirds of the sample was randomly selected from the original sample for development, and the remaining was used for validation. Item response theory methods were applied to shorten scales. The graded response model of Samejima was used to fit the item responses. The shortened scale was evaluated with the validation set by examining the mean difference, the proportion of respondents correctly predicted, correlation and weighted kappa between the shortened form and the original observed scores. Results reveal that a three-item BRBI, a four-item BRST, a three-item BRBS and a two-item BRAS forecast the scores on the original scales with wonderful consistency and are alike in measurement precision with no loss or only little loss in detecting group differences. Prospective validation on new diagnosed breast cancer patients and with poor QOL is needed. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Signal transduction pathways are important in physiology and pathophysiology. Targeted drugs aim at modifying pathogenic pathway activity, e.g., in cancer. Optimal treatment choice requires assays to measure pathway activity in individual patient tissue or cell samples. We developed a method enabling quantitative measurement of functional pathway activity based on Bayesian computational model inference of pathway activity from measurements of mRNA levels of target genes of the pathway-associated transcription factor. Oestrogen receptor, Wnt, and PI3K-FOXO pathway assays have been described previously. Here, we report model development for androgen receptor, Hedgehog, TGFβ, and NFκB pathway assays, biological validation on multiple cell types, and analysis of data from published clinical studies (multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, contact dermatitis, Ewing sarcoma, lymphoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, skin and prostate cancer). Multiple pathway analysis of clinical prostate cancer (PCa) studies showed increased AR activity in hyperplasia and primary PCa but variable AR activity in castrate resistant (CR) PCa, loss of TGFβ activity in PCa, increased Wnt activity in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion protein-positive PCa, active PI3K pathway in advanced PCa, and active PI3K and NFκB as potential hormonal resistance pathways. Potential value for future clinical practice includes disease subtyping and prediction and targeted therapy response prediction and monitoring. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is implicated in cancer metastasis and drug resistance. Specifically targeting cancer cells in an EMT-like state may have therapeutic value. In this study, we developed a cell imaging-based high-content screening protocol to identify EMT-selective cytotoxic compounds. Among the 2,640 compounds tested, salinomycin and monensin, both monovalent cation ionophores, displayed a potent and selective cytotoxic effect against EMT-like cells. The mechanism of action of monensin was further evaluated. Monensin (10 nM) induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in TEM 4-18 cells. In addition, monensin rapidly induced swelling of Golgi apparatus and perturbed mitochondrial function. These are previously known effects of monensin, albeit occurring at much higher concentrations in the micromolar range. The cytotoxic effect of monensin was not blocked by inhibitors of ferroptosis. To explore the generality of our findings, we evaluated the toxicity of monensin in 24 human cancer cell lines and classified them as resistant or sensitive based on IC 50 cutoff of 100 nM. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified EMT as the top enriched gene set in the sensitive group. Importantly, increased monensin sensitivity in EMT-like cells is associated with elevated uptake of 3 H-monensin compared to resistant cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Supervised learning methods are commonly applied in medical image analysis. However, the success of these approaches is highly dependent on the availability of large manually detailed annotated dataset. Thus an automatic refined segmentation of whole-slide image (WSI) is significant to alleviate the annotation workload of pathologists. But most of the current ways can only output a rough prediction of lesion areas and consume much time in each slide. In this paper, we propose a fast and refined cancer regions segmentation framework v3_DCNN, which first preselects tumor regions using a classification model Inception-v3 and then employs a semantic segmentation model DCNN for refined segmentation. Our framework can generate a dense likelihood heatmap with the 1/8 side of original WSI in 11.5 minutes on the Camelyon16 dataset, which saves more than one hour for each WSI compared with the initial DCNN model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a higher FROC score 83.5% with the champion’s method of Camelyon16 challenge 80.7%. Based on v3 DCNN model, we further automatically produce heatmap of WSI and extract polygons of lesion regions for doctors, which is very helpful for their pathological diagnosis, detailed annotation and thus contributes to developing a more powerful deep learning model. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) accounts for 5-10% of thyroid malignancies. The origin of medullary thyroid cancer is para-follicular cells of the thyroid. Several studies showed that relationship between adipokines and cancers. Omentin is an adipokine secreted from adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma levels of omentin in patients with medullary thyroid cancer. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 90 individuals were studied (45 cases and 45 controls). Omentin plasma levels of these individuals were measured by ELISA method. Results: In general, plasma levels of omnentin in all patients with MTC was significantly higher than the control group (P = 0.002). Omentin plasma levels in both women and men with MTC were ignificantly higher than the corresponding control group (P = 0.0371, and P = 0.0240, respectively). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that plasma levels omentin in patients with MTV were higher than the healthy group. Thus omentin may be considered as a novel and promising biomarker for diagnosis or confirmation of MTC. © 2019, Semnan University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The platinum-based drug cisplatin is a widely used first-line therapy for several cancers. Cisplatin interacts with DNA mainly in the form of Pt-d(GpG) di-adduct, which stalls cell proliferation and activates DNA damage response. Although cisplatin shows a broad spectrum of anticancer activity, its utility is limited due to acquired drug resistance and toxicity to non-targeted tissues. Here, by integrating genome-wide high-throughput Damage-seq, XR-seq, and RNA-seq approaches, along with publicly available epigenomic data, we systematically study the genome-wide profiles of cisplatin damage formation and excision repair in mouse kidney, liver, lung and spleen. We find different DNA damage and repair spectra across mouse organs, which are associated with tissue-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles. The framework and the multi-omics data we present here constitute an unbiased foundation for understanding the mechanisms of cellular response to cisplatin. Our approach should be applicable for studying drug resistance and for tailoring cancer chemotherapy regimens. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) comprises more than 50% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children and adolescents. An official report published by the Mexican National Center for the Control and Prevention of Cancer in the Pediatric and Adolescent Populations, reported a lymphoma OS of 71% (including all Hodgkin and NHL). The Mexican Association of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology conducted a retrospective study to analyze the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with diagnosis of B-NHL in Mexico, in order to perceive the main areas of improvement in the health care. METHODS: From 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016, 166 pediatric patients were diagnosed with B-cell NHL at the participant institutions. RESULTS: According to histology the outcomes were 5-year EFS 63%, for BL/BLL, and 80% DLBCL, (P = .051), 5-year PFS 81%, for BL/BLL, and 91% for DLBCL, (P = .126), and 5-year OS 71%, for BL/BLL, and 83% for DLBCL, (P = .095). DISCUSSION: Overall, 18 patients died due to acute treatment toxicity, resulting in a cumulative incidence of toxic death of 10.84% and an early death rate of 7.23%, defined as <30 days after initial treatment. In conclusion, there is an urgent need to establish an academic collaboration to create strategies to improve pediatric cancer care according to our resources, especially in diseases with expected excellent prognosis as B-NHL. These strategies must include comprehensive supportive care, early referral, and the creation of easy communication between pediatric and adults centers as well as late-effects clinics.",

    "Abstract": "In recent times, Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) synthesized from plant extracts and their anticancer activity have attracted significant attention. We report the green approach for the synthesis of AuNPs using extract from Abies spectabilis plant. In this study, the reaction parameters were optimized to control the size of the nanoparticle, which was confirmed by Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM). Various characterization technique such as SAED pattern, UV visible spectroscopy, EDX, FTIR, and AFM were employed to analyze the synthesized AuNPs obtained from A. spectabilis plant extract. Furthermore, we investigated the anticancer activities using T24 cell lines. Interestingly, the results of extensive screening on the applications of newly synthesized AuNPs were tested for their cytotoxicity effects on anticancer activity against T24 cells by MTT assay. The cell apoptosis was studied using TUNEL, DAPI, caspase activity, cell invasion and migration. Nanoparticles at different concentrations ranging from 1 to 25 μg/ml exhibited a dose dependent cytotoxicity for 24 h. Condensation and DNA fragmentation are characteristic of apoptosis by DAPI, TUNEL staining, and the significant up regulations of Beclin-1, Bax and caspase 3, whereas the expressions of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bid were down regulated. However, this study, therefore attempts to report the synthesis, characterization, and anticancer activity of gold nanoparticles of A. spectabilis plant extract beneficial for cancer therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "This study demonstrated that fenofibrate, a lipid-lowering drug, induced a significant time-dependent cytotoxicity of hepatoma Hep3B cells. Hep3B cells are significantly more sensitive to cell killing by fenofibrate than hepatoma HepG2, lung cancer CH27 and oral cancer HSC-3 cells. From the result of docking simulation, fenofibrate can bind excellently to the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FASN) binding site as orlistat, a FASN inhibitor, acts. The fenofibrate-induced cell cytotoxicity was protected by addition of palmitate, indicating that the cytotoxic effect of fenofibrate is due to starvation of Hep3B cells by inhibiting the formation of end product in the FASN reaction. Inhibition of lipid metabolism-related proteins expression, such as proteins containing thioesterase domain and fatty acid transport proteins, was involved in the fenofibrate-induced Hep3B cell death. Fenofibrate caused S and G2/M cell cycle arrest by inducing cyclin A/Cdk2 and reducing cyclin D1 and E protein levels in Hep3B cells. The anti-tumor roles of fenofibrate on Hep3B cells by inducing apoptosis and necroptosis were dependent on the expression of Bcl-2/caspase family members and RIP1/RIP3 proteins, respectively. These results suggest that fenofibrate has an anti-cancer effect in Hep3B cells and inhibition of lipid metabolism may be involved in fenofibrate-induced Hep3B cells apoptosis and necroptosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The objective is to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in breast cancer patients aged less than 40 years. This retrospective, single-center study evaluated 92 women aged <40 years who received a diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma between 2008 and 2012. These patients underwent a breast MRI before treatment and follow-up at the same institution. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze overall survival, with the log-rank test used to compare different groups. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) values. The mean age of the patients was 34 years (range: 25–39 years) and the mean tumor size was 3.9 cm in maximal dimension (range: 0.7–10.5 cm). Recurrence was observed in 21 (22.8%) patients and 15 (16.3%) patients did not survive during a mean follow-up period of 5.4 ± 1.9 years. MRI findings associated with worse overall survival included tumor size >5 cm (HR:5.404; 95% CI:1.922–15.198; p = 0.017), presence of non-mass enhancement (HR:3.730; 95% CI:1.274–10.922; p = 0.016) and multifocal tumor (HR:3.618; 95% CI:1.151–11.369; p = 0.028). Inconclusion, MRI findings that are suggestive of more extensive disease were associated with worse overall survival in young breast cancer patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery and mastectomy with node positive disease has been shown to reduce risk of recurrence and mortality in the treatment of breast cancer. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after conservative surgery offers several advantages over conventional RT including improved acute and late toxicity and quality of life (QoL). We undertook this study to prospectively evaluate acute (≤90 days after last dose of radiotherapy) and long-term (>90 days) cutaneous, esophageal, and fibrosis toxicity and QoL in breast cancer patients treated by adjuvant IMRT after breast surgery. We included patients with complex volumes for which 3D RT does not allow a good coverage of target volumes and sparing organs at risk. We report here an interim analysis with a median follow-up of 13.1 months (range, 6.5–25.9 months). Most of the acute toxicity was cutaneous (95.9%) and oesophageal (59.6%), and mostly grade 1 and 2. Medium-term cutaneous toxicity rate was 25.6%, and mostly grade 1. Medium-term esophageal toxicity was rare (1.8%). In this series acute oesophageal toxicity was found to be associated with dosimetric factors. QoL was well preserved throughout the study, and aesthetic outcomes were good. Based on these data, tomotherapy may be a favorable alternative to other techniques in patients needing a complex irradiation of the breast and lymph node volumes. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies. Five-year survival rate of OvCa ranges from 30–92%, depending on the spread of disease at diagnosis. Role of chemokines is well appreciated in cancer, including OvCa. However, their precise role is understudied. Here, we show clinical and biological significance of CXCR6-CXCL16 and ADAM10 in OvCa. Expression of CXCR6 and N-terminal CXCL16 was significantly higher in serous carcinoma tissues compared to endometrioid. OvCa cells (SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3) also showed higher expression of CXCR6 than normal ovarian epithelial cells (IOSE-7576) while CXCL16 was higher in SKOV-3 than IOSE-7576. Furthermore, N-terminal CXCL16 was higher in conditioned media of OvCa cells than IOSE-7576. Compared to OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 cells, which had higher CXCL16, expressed significantly higher transcripts of ADAM10, a protease that cleaves CXCL16. OVCAR-3 cells showed higher CXCR6 specific migration whereas SKOV-3 cells showed more invasion. Difference in invasive potential of these cells was due to modulation of different MMPs after CXCL16 stimulation. Higher CXCR6 expression in serous papillary carcinoma tissues suggests its association with aggressive OvCa. Increased migration-invasion towards CXCL16 implies its role in metastatic spread. Therefore, CXCR6-CXCL16 axis could be used to differentiate between aggressive versus non-aggressive disease and as a target for better prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is prolonged for some patients; however, the predictive factors remain unknown. We focused on a peripheral blood biomarker, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), regarding T-DM1 treatment efficacy. Fifty-three advanced or metastatic breast cancers treated with T-DM1 were retrospectively recruited from three institutes. The NLR in the peripheral blood was measured at baseline and after one cycle. The cutoff value of the NLR was set at median value 2.56. The progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with NLR-low at baseline (n = 26; median, not reached) was significantly better than that of patients with NLR-high (n = 27; median, 4.13 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.226; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.112–0.493; p = 0.0001). Longer overall survival was significantly associated with a low NLR (HR, 0.384; 95% CI, 0.170–0.910; p = 0.0296). In the subgroup analysis, patients with NLR-low consistently had longer PFS compared to those with NLR-high irrespective of the number of prior chemotherapy regimens, prior trastuzumab, visceral metastasis, estrogen receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) score. Although detailed mechanisms remain unknown, treatment efficacy of T-DM1 may be partly mediated by activation of the immune system. Low baseline NLR appears to be beneficial for treatment with T-DM1 in HER2-positive breast cancers. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer and antioxidant activities of low molecular weight subfractions isolated from secondary metabolites produced by the wood degrading fungus Cerrena unicolor. Human colon cancer cells (stage I) HT-29 and human normal colon epithelial cells CCD 841 CoTr were used in the research. The present study demonstrated that the low molecular weight subfractions exhibited inhibitory activity towards human colon cancer cells HT-29 at a concentration range of 25–200 μg/mL. All 6 subfractions inhibited proliferation of cells down to 47.5–9.2% at the highest concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. The most desired activity was exhibited by subfractions S, 3, 4, and 5, as the proliferation of HT-29 cells was inhibited to the greatest extent (16.5, 47.5, 42.7, and 26.1% of the control, respectively), while the effect on CCD 841 CoTr cells was the mildest (inhibition to 54.4, 71.4, 79.4, and 53.4%, compared to the control, respectively). The microscopic observation revealed that all extracts induced programmed cell death, i.e. apoptosis (up to 44.4% (subfraction 6) towards HT-29 and less than 20% (most fractions) towards CCD 841 CoTr), with no or a significantly low level of necrosis in both cell lines at the same time. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor volume is a parameter used to evaluate the performance of new therapies in lung cancer research. Conventional methods that are used to estimate tumor size in mouse models fail to provide fast and reliable volumetric data for tumors grown non-subcutaneously. Here, we evaluated the use of iodine-staining combined with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to estimate the tumor volume of ex vivo tumor-burdened lungs. We obtained fast high spatial resolution three-dimensional information of the lungs, and we demonstrated that iodine-staining highlights tumors and unhealthy tissue. We processed iodine-stained lungs for histopathological analysis with routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. We compared the traditional tumor burden estimation performed manually with H&E histological slices with a semi-automated method using micro-CT datasets. In mouse models that develop lung tumors with well precise boundaries, the method that we describe here enables to perform a quick estimation of tumorous tissue volume in micro-CT images. Our method overestimates the tumor burden in tumors surrounded by abnormal tissue, while traditional histopathological analysis underestimates tumor volume. We propose to embed micro-CT imaging to the traditional workflow of tumorous lung analyses in preclinical cancer research as a strategy to obtain a more accurate estimation of the total lung tumor burden. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "With the advancement of treatment modalities in radiation therapy for cancer patients, outcomes have improved, but at the cost of increased treatment plan complexity and planning time. The accurate prediction of dose distributions would alleviate this issue by guiding clinical plan optimization to save time and maintain high quality plans. We have modified a convolutional deep network model, U-net (originally designed for segmentation purposes), for predicting dose from patient image contours of the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). We show that, as an example, we are able to accurately predict the dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer patients, where the average Dice similarity coefficient is 0.91 when comparing the predicted vs. true isodose volumes between 0% and 100% of the prescription dose. The average value of the absolute differences in [max, mean] dose is found to be under 5% of the prescription dose, specifically for each structure is [1.80%, 1.03%](PTV), [1.94%, 4.22%](Bladder), [1.80%, 0.48%](Body), [3.87%, 1.79%](L Femoral Head), [5.07%, 2.55%](R Femoral Head), and [1.26%, 1.62%](Rectum) of the prescription dose. We thus managed to map a desired radiation dose distribution from a patient’s PTV and OAR contours. As an additional advantage, relatively little data was used in the techniques and models described in this paper. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Progesterone receptor membrane component1 (PGRMC1) is a heme-binding protein involved in cancers and Alzheimer’s disease. PGRMC1 consists of a short N-terminal extracellular or luminal domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a long cytoplasmic domain. Previously, we generated two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 108-B6 and 4A68 that recognize cell surface-expressed PGRMC1 (csPGRMC1) on human pluripotent stem cells and some cancer cells. In this study, flow cytometric analysis found that an anti-PGRMC1 antibody recognizing the N-terminus of PGRMC1 could not bind to csPGRMC1 on cancer cells, and 108-B6 and 4A68 binding to csPGRMC1 was inhibited by trypsin treatment, suggesting that the epitopes of 108-B6 and 4A68 are trypsin-sensitive. To examine the epitope specificity of 108-B6 and 4A68, glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fused PGRMC1 mutants were screened to identify the epitopes targeted by the antibodies. The result showed that 108-B6 and 4A68 recognized C-terminal residues 183–195 and 171–182, respectively, of PGRMC1, where trypsin-sensitive sites are located. A polyclonal anti-PGRMC1 antibody raised against the C-terminus of PGRMC1 could also recognized csPGRMC1 in a trypsin-sensitive manner, suggesting that the C-terminus of csPGRMC1 is exposed on the cell surface. This finding reveals that csPGRMC1 has a non-conventional plasma membrane topology, which is different from that of intracellular PGRMC1. © 2019, The Author(s).",
