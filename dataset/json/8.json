    "Abstract": "5-Nitrofurans are antibiotic pro-drugs that have potential as cancer therapeutics. Here, we show that 5-nitrofurans can be bio-activated by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A1/1A3 enzymes that are highly expressed in a subpopulation of cancer-initiating (stem) cells. We discover that the 5-nitrofuran, nifuroxazide, is selective for bio-activation by ALDH1 isoforms over ALDH2, whereby it both oxidizes ALDH1 and is converted to cytotoxic metabolites in a two-hit pro-drug mechanism. We show that ALDH1 High melanoma cells are sensitive to nifuroxazide, while ALDH1A3 loss-of-function mutations confer drug resistance. In tumors, nifuroxazide targets ALDH1 High melanoma subpopulations with the subsequent loss of melanoma-initiating cell potential. BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy increases ALDH1 expression in patient melanomas, and effectively combines with nifuroxazide in melanoma cell models. The selective eradication of ALDH1 High cells by nifuroxazide-ALDH1 activation goes beyond current strategies based on inhibiting ALDH1 and provides a rational basis for the nifuroxazide mechanism of action in cancer. © 2018 The AuthorsA major challenge for cancer treatment is that tumors are comprised of subpopulations with differing growth potential and drug sensitivity. Here, Sarvi and colleagues reveal that the clinically approved antibiotic, nifuroxazide, selectively eliminates ALDH1 High melanoma-initiating cell subpopulations. This conceptual advance opens up new avenues in drug repurposing and melanoma therapy. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: A number of studies have investigated the roles of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) gene rs3212986 polymorphisms as potential biomarkers in gastric cancer (GC). However, the results were inconsistent. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to explore ERCC1 rs3212986 polymorphisms in the chemotherapy response and clinical outcome of GC. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched up to July 28, 2017, for studies on the association between ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphisms and response to chemotherapy as well as overall survival time of GC. A fixed-effect or random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) based on the results from the heterogeneity tests. Results: The result revealed that there was no significant association between the ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphism and response to chemotherapy in GC under comparison models (AA + CA versus CC, OR 0.95, P=0.80, AA versus CA, OR 0.85, P=0.55, AA versus CC, OR 0.74, P=0.47). Further identification suggested that ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphisms were not linked with the overall survival of GC (AA + CA versus CC, OR 1.09, P=0.52, AA versus CA, OR 1.05, P=0.85, AA versus CC, OR 1.43, P=0.23). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis indicated that the ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphism was not associated with response to chemotherapy or overall survival time in GC. Well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and more ethnic groups should be performed to further validate our results. © 2018 Tang et al.",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the recent curative effect of the postoperative short-term quality of life between uniportal and three portal video-assisted thoracic surgery for non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 266 patients with NSCLC who underwent intended VATS lobectomy by a single surgical team in our ward between January 2016 and August 2017. The general clinical date, perioperative data and short-term life quality were individually compared and analyzed between the two groups. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in terms of clinicopathological features, total number of dissected lymph nodes and nodal stations, postoperative complications and pulmonary complications (P>0.05). Compared with three portal VATS, the intraoperative blood loss, chest tube duration, postoperative thoracic drainage, length of stay and NRS score were significantly decreased in uniportal VATS, with significant differences (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: As a more minimally invasive surgery, uniportal VATS can be safely and effectively performed for resectable lung cancer, which would achieve even better operation curative effect than three portal VATS.",

    "Abstract": "Targeted drug delivery has shown promise in improving the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs. Gemcitabine hydrochloride (GEM) is a broad-range chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of various cancers. However, systemic use of free GEM is restricted because of its poor physicochemical properties and nonspecific drug delivery, resulting in dose-dependent adverse effects. In this study, a fucose-conjugated graphene oxide (GO)-based smart targeted nanocarrier system was designed to provide high loading, sustained release, and targeted high concentrations of GEM to cancer cells. Fucose-conjugated GO nanosheets (FGONS) and GEM-loaded fucose-conjugated GO nanosheets (GEM-FGONS) were prepared and characterized by various techniques. About 36.2 % of GEM was loaded to the FGONS, which showed a pH-dependent release over a period of 48 h. A colloidal suspension of GEM-FGONS was found to be physiochemically stable for up to 96 h. In cytotoxicity studies, GEM-FGONS demonstrated time- and dose-dependent high toxicities on fucose-receptor-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and A549 human lung cancer cells. Moreover, targeted formulations were more efficacious than non-targeted or free GEM. Overall, bioconjugation of fucose helps in the stabilizing and targeting of graphene oxide nanosheets. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

    "Abstract": "Cisplatin is a widely used anti-cancer drug in clinic, while many cancer cells gradually exhibited serious cisplatin resistance recently, which resulted in reducing its clinical effects. Glutathione transferases (GSTs) as an extensive expressed metabolic enzyme in human, plays a significant role in the metabolism of cisplatin. Thus, sensitively and accurately detecting the activity of GSTs in various cancer cells and tumor tissues is very urgent for the rational use of cisplatin in clinic. Herein, a fluorescent probe (BDCN) for GSTs detection was developed, with the high selectivity, prominent sensitivity and an ultrahigh imaging resolution, importantly, this detection progress was not affected by the interference of endogenous and exogenous substances especially GSH. The activity of GSTs in MCF-7, LoVo cells and even tumor tissues was successfully analyzed and imaged by BDCN. Notably, MCF-7 cells displayed a much higher expression of GSTs than LoVo cells, which was also confirmed by western bolt. The significant differences of GSTs expression directly resulted in the stronger resistance of MCF-7 cells toward cisplatin than LoVo cells and inhibiting the expression of GSTs with siRNA, further decreasing MCF-7 cells resistance toward cisplatin. These findings demonstrated that GSTs contributed to the intrinsic resistance of cancer cells toward cisplatin. Importantly, BDCN may serve as a promising tool for studying the biological function and process of cellular GSTs in living systems and further provide vital guidance in cancer treatment by cisplatin. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR), as a major obstacle in cancer therapy, has resulted in over 90% of cancer chemotherapeutic failure. Mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSNs) have been demonstrated to be tuned with large pore sizes, mediating the MDR-reversal effects. However, the study that surface functionality of the large pore sized-MSNs affects the MDR-overcoming effects hasn't been extensively studied. In this study, we developed a new dendrimer-like MSNs delivery system based on a rational synthesis strategy and further modified MSNs with various surface functionalities to evaluate their roles in overcoming cancer MDR. Our results showed that the small particle sized-MSNs could be fabricated with dendrimer-like internal structure, resulting in the large pore size of 9 nm. Surface functionality of MSNs, especially hydroxylation and carboxylation, largely improved the intra-nuclear delivery and therapeutic efficiency of DOX for MCF7/ADR cells, which was not up to inhibiting P-gp expression but significantly increasing the intracellular drug accumulation of over 90% even under the strong drug efflux. This study indicates that surface functionality design strategy may display the potential of the large pore sized-MSNs as the efficient chemotherapeutic carriers to combat MDR. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This study reports data from three clinical studies using the time-resolved diffuse optical spectroscopy (TRS) system among breast cancer patients. The parameters of oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb), and oxygen saturation (SO2) were evaluated using TRS, and its efficacy was tested in three trials. In trial 1, we recruited 118 patients with primary breast cancer to estimate the tumor detection rate. The cumulative detection rate was 62.7%, while that in T stage 0 was 31.3% and in T stage 1 was 44.7%. These were lower than those of T stage 2 (78.9%) and T stage 3 (100%). Next, we used TRS to monitor tumor hemodynamic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 100) and found that pathological complete response (pCR) tumors had significantly lower tumor tHb than non-pCR tumors; a similar result was observed in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, but not in ER-positive tumors. The third trial monitored hemodynamic response to antiangiogenic therapy, bevacizumab (n = 28), and we demonstrated that sequential optical measurement of tumor SO2 might be useful for detecting acute hypoxia 1-3 days after bevacizumab initiation. Next, response monitoring of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (n = 30) suggested that changes in tumor tHb during treatment can predict and distinguish between responsive and non-responsive tumors early in letrozole therapy. In conclusion, our results show that hemodynamic monitoring of tumors by TRS could pair the unique features of tumor physiology to drug therapy and contribute to patient-tailored medicine. We recently established a platform for performing TRS in patients with breast cancer. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Recently, a combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat to kill cancer cells, respectively has attracted considerable attention because it gives synergistic effects on the cancer treatment by utilizing the radiation of nontoxic low-energy photons such as long wavelength visible light and near IR (NIR) penetrating into subcutaneous region. For the effective combination of the phototherapies, various organic photosensitizer-conjugated gold nanocomplexes have been developed, but they have still some disadvantages due to photobleaching and unnecessary energy transfer of the organic photosensitizers. Results: In this study, we fabricated novel inorganic phototherapeutic nanocomplexes (Au NR-TiO 2 NCs) by conjugating gold nanorods (Au NRs) with defective TiO 2 nanoparticle clusters (d-TiO 2 NP clusters) and characterized their optical and photothermal properties. They were observed to absorb a broad range of visible light and near IR (NIR) from 500 to 1000 nm, exhibiting the generation of ROS as well as the photothermal effect for the simultaneous application of PDT and PTT. The resultant combination of PDT and PTT treatments of HeLa cells incubated with the nanocomplexes caused a synergistic increase in the cell death compared to the single treatment. Conclusion: The higher efficacy of cell death by the combination of PDT and PTT treatments with the nanocomplexes is likely attributed to the increases of ROS generation from the TiO 2 NCs with the aid of local surface plasma resonance (LSPR)-induced hot electrons and heat generation from Au NRs, suggesting that Au NR-TiO 2 NCs are promising nanomaterials for the in vivo combinatorial phototherapy of cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although the genetic spectrum of human colorectal cancer (CRC) is mainly characterized by APC, KRAS and TP53 mutations, driver genes in tumor initiation have not been conclusively demonstrated. In this study, we aimed to identify novel markers for CRC. Methods: We performed exome analysis of sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC) coding regions to screen loss of function (LoF) mutation genes, and carried out systems-level approaches to confirm top rank gene in this study. Results: We identified loss of BMP5 is an early event in CRC. Deep sequencing identified BMP5 was mutated in 7.7% (8/104) of sCRC samples, with 37.5% truncating mutation frequency. Notably, BMP5 negative expression and its prognostic value is uniquely significant in sCRC but not in other tumor types. Furthermore, BMP5 expression was positively correlated with E-cadherin in CRC patients and its dysregulation play a vital role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus triggering tumor initiation and development. RNA sequencing identified, independent of BMP/Smads pathway, BMP5 signaled though Jak-Stat pathways to inhibit the activation of oncogene EPSTI1. Conclusions: Our result support a novel concept that the importance of BMP5 in sCRC. The tumor suppressor role of BMP5 highlights its crucial role in CRC initiation and development. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) was previously established to impact several phenotypes in many kinds of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. However, its prognostic significance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) needs support of further evidence. This study was designed to address the issue. Methods: PAI-1 expression was detected by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from 93 PDAC patients with surgical resection from September 2004 to December 2008. Its relationships with clinicopathologic variables and tumor-specific survival (TSS) were further evaluated using Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, as well as Cox regression analyses. Results: Expression of PAI-1 was much higher in tumor than that in nontumor tissues, based on comparison of all samples and 74 matched ones (95 [47.5, 180] vs. 80 [45, 95], Z = -2.439, P = 0.015 and 100 [46.9, 182.5] vs. 80 [45, 95], Z = -2.594, P = 0.009, respectively). In addition, tumoral PAI-1 expression was positively associated with N stage (22/35 for N1 vs. 21/51 for N0, χ 2 = 3.903, P = 0.048). Univariate analyses showed that TSS of patients with high PAI-1 tumors was significantly poorer than that of those with low PAI-1 tumors (log rank value = 19.00, P &lt; 0.0001). In multivariate Cox regression test, PAI-1 expression was identified as an independent predictor for long-term prognosis of resectable PDAC (hazard ratio = 2.559, 95% confidence interval = 1.499-4.367, P = 0.001). Conclusion: These results suggest that expression of PAI-1 is upregulated in PDAC and might serve as a poor prognostic indicator. © 2018 Chinese Medical Journal - Produced by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",

    "Abstract": "We report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of polyaminocarboxylate ligand-based antibody conjugates for potential application in targeted cancer therapy and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. We synthesized a new polyaminocarboxylate chelate (CAB-NE3TA) as a potential anticancer agent. CAB-NE3TA displayed potent inhibitory activities against various cancer cell lines. We then designed a multifunctional theranostic platform (CAB-NE3TA-PAN-IR800) constructed on an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted antibody (panitumumab, PAN) labeled with a NIR fluorescent dye. We also built the first atomistic model of the EGFR–PAN complex and loaded it with the cytotoxic CAB-NE3TA and the NIR dye. The therapeutic (CAB-NE3TA-PAN) and theranostic (CAB-NE3TA-PAN-IR800) conjugates were evaluated using an EGFR-positive A431 (human skin cancer) cell xenograft mouse model. Biodistribution studies using NIR fluorescence imaging demonstrated that the CAB-NE3TA-PAN labeled with the IR800 dye selectively targeted the A431 tumors in mice and resulted in prolonged retention in the tumor tissue and displayed excellent clearance in blood and normal organs. The therapeutic conjugate was capable of significantly inhibiting tumor growth, leading to nearly complete disappearance of tumors in the mice. The results of our pilot in vivo studies support further evaluation of the novel ligand-based therapeutic and theranostic conjugates for targeted iron chelation cancer therapy and imaging applications. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy have demonstrated great potential in cancer treatment. However, it is difficult to provide clear information of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of chemodrugs and transplanted immune cells in vivo by traditional approaches, resulting in inadequate therapy. Here, a multiplexed intravital imaging strategy by using fluorescence in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) is first developed to visualize the two events of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in vivo, so that a combinational administration is programed to improve the therapeutical effects against a mouse model of human breast cancer. In detail, Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) (λEm = 1350 nm) loaded with stromal-cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) and chemodrug doxorubicin (DOX) are first administrated to deliver the SDF-1α and DOX to the tumor site. After their arrival, monitored by Ag2Se QD fluorescence, natural killer (NK)-92 cells labeled with Ag2S QDs (λEm = 1050 nm) are intravenously injected so that the cells are recruited to the tumor by the chemotaxis of SDF-1α, which is visualized by Ag2S QD fluorescence. Such an imaging approach allows simultaneous evaluation of the behaviors of individual injections in vivo, and facilitates optimized administration regimens, resulting in enhanced tumor inhibition. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have been considered to be a promising candidate for hyperthermia-based anticancer therapy. Herein, we introduce albumin-assisted AuNCs composed of small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, <6 nm) assembled with strands of polyallylamine (PAH), which exhibited strong surface plasmon resonance upon near-infrared (NIR, ∼808 nm) laser irradiation and good in vivo stability. Our albumin-assisted PAH-AuNCs (BSA/PAH-AuNCs) were facilely fabricated as a top-down process by a simple ultrasonication after the preparation of large nano-aggregates of PAH-AuNPs. Albumin played a critical role as a stabilizer and surfactant in making loosely associated large aggregates and thereby producing small gold nanoclusters (∼60 nm) of slightly negative charge upon ultrasonication. The prepared BSA/PAH-AuNCs displayed excellent hyperthermal effects (∼60 °C) in response to ∼808-nm NIR laser irradiation in a 4T1 cell system in vitro and in 4T1 cell tumor xenograft mice in vivo, indicating their remarkable potential to suppress breast cancer growth, without almost no significant toxicity in histology. Consequently, our gold nanoclusters should be considered as a promising photothermal agent that are easy to manufacture and exhibit marked anticancer effects in terms of tumor ablation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The majority of breast tumors express estrogen receptors (ER), and are treated with endocrine therapy (ET) drugs to target ERs and estrogen (E2) biosynthesis in the management of early and metastatic ER + breast cancer. However, ∼50% of patients receiving an ET exhibit either intrinsic (de novo) resistance or acquire resistance to these treatments despite persistent expression of ER in the tumors. Thus, an assay to better predict the drug responsiveness of ER targeting ET drugs, such as fulvestrant (Ful) would be beneficial for clinical treatments. Here, we compared two genetically related cell lines isolated from ER+ MCF-7 human breast cells: the LCC1 (Ful-sensitive (s)) and LCC9 Ful-resistant (r)). Using passivated-electrode insulator-based dielectrophoresis (π DEP), the DEP profile of LCC1 and LCC9 Ful-response were compared. Ful-s LCC1 cells responded with a gradual crossover frequency (f0) shift from 700 kHz to 300 kHz over 72 h. The Ful-r LCC9 cells showed a gradual f0 shift from 100 kHz to 700 kHz over this time period. In response to E2, LCC1 cells showed a small f0 shift from 700 kHz to 600 kHz while LCC9 showed a large f0 change from 100 kHz to 800 kHz. There are no significant differences in gene pathway-specific mRNA expression between the LCC1 and LCC9 cells. Nevertheless, several mRNAs identified in an unbiased screen are differentially expressed in LCC1 and LCC9 cells including PALLD, ADAP1, SLC12A2, and TM4SF1. Investigation of these genes could begin to clarify how responses to ET translate into changes in cellular bioelectric properties and contribute to validation of DEP ET response biomarkers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cu/Co bimetallic nanomaterials (BNMs) were synthesized firstly. The chemiluminescence (CL) catalytic properties of BNMs were investigated systemically. Experimental results revealed that combined Cu with Co could cause a 67.9 ± 3.5% increase in the CL intensity because of a great synergic catalytic effect. Based on this interesting phenomenon, a steric hindrance strategy for cancer cell detection was fabricated. BNMs were used as nanocatalysts and the carrier modified with capture DNA. In presence of CCRF-CEM cell, sgc8 aptamer and probe DNA recognized with CCRF-CEM. And the bio bar code CCRF-CEM cells were formed. After bio bar code CCRF-CEM cells hybridized with capture DNA which modified Cu/Co BNMs, CL probe was introduced. The CL intensity is linearly related to the concentration of cell from 500 to 100,000 cells/mL. The detection limit is 270 cells/mL and the relative standard deviation is 3.9% at a level of 1000 cells/mL (n = 9). This method was successfully applied to the determination of cell in spiked real human serum. Due to its sensitivity and selectivity, this method offers a promising approach for the detection of cell and other biomolecules. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The analysis of telomerase is of great significance for the study and diagnosis of cancer. In this work, a dual-functional Au NP probe for the quantification and imaging of intracellular telomerase was prepared. The probe contained an elemental tag (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-tris-acetic acid (Tb-DOTA)) for accurate quantification using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and a fluorescent tag (FAM) which constructed the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system with Au NPs for fluorescence imaging. After the probe entered into the Hela cells, the telomerase primer was extended with TTAGGG repeats in the presence of the intracellular telomerase, resulting in turning on the fluorescence of FAM and releasing the Tb-DOTA. Thus, the intracellular telomerase could be in situ visualized by the released FAM with fluorescence imaging and quantified by the released Tb-DOTA with ICP-MS detection. The average amount of telomerase in one Hela cell was quantified to be 3.1 × 10−11 IU. The proposed method was demonstrated with good potential in the study of telomerase and the cancer diagnosis, providing a new strategy for the analysis of intracellular biomarkers by ICP-MS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) offers a two-stage, often insufficient or so-called variable model of cutaneous melanoma treatment. This model starts with primary excision and an initial operational safety margin of 0.5 cm in all directions, followed by a re-excision with an additional field of operational security, determined by histologically established tumor thickness (with or without removal of SLN). We present a brand new method of melanoma surgery, the so-called One Step melanoma surgery (OSMS), in which cutaneous melanomas (regardless of their thickness) could be removed by single surgical intervention.CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a patient with cutaneous melanoma, with postoperatively established Breslow’s tumor thickness of 6 mm, operated on the AJCC model within two surgical sessions. The usual primary excision was performed with a surgical safety margin of 0.5 cm in all directions, followed by a secondary excision with an additional surgical security field of 1.2 cm in all directions (due to the patient's wish for the optimal cosmetic result, agreed and approved by the dermatosurgeon performing the manipulation).CONCLUSION: The two-stage method for the treatment of melanomas is often insufficient due to: 1) the inability (in this case) secondary excision in the face area to be conducted with an additional recommended operational security field of 1.5 cm in all directions; and 2) the patient's wish for a better cosmetic result, which should be achieved with less surgical security field, resulting in a compromise solution for re-excision with an additional surgical field of 1.2 cm in all directions. © 2018 Georgi Tchernev, Ivanka Temelkova.",

    "Abstract": "A B S T R A C T Purpose To outline current practices and challenges in the systemic management of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Design We conducted a focused review of hallmark randomized controlled trials informing the systemic treatment of patients with RCC. We concentrated on trials informing the use of combination therapies, therapy in both treatment-naïve and previously treated patients, sequential treatment strategies, and schedules. Results The systemic treatment of advanced RCC has experienced tremendous progress over the past 15 years. An improved understanding of the canonical pathways implicated in RCC pathogenesis has resulted in the development of molecularly targeted and immunotherapy options for patients. These therapies have replaced cytokine-based treatments as the standard of care for patients with advanced RCC. Until recently, sequential vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–targeted therapy or VEGF-targeted therapy followed by mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition has been the prevailing treatment paradigm for patients. However, newer agents such as cabozantinib and nivolumab have challenged this traditional approach. In addition, combination treatments including nivolumab plus ipilimumab and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab have transformed the RCC treatment landscape, and other doublet combinations in clinical testing will likely continue to alter the treatment paradigm in RCC. Currently, factors that inform treatment selection between different therapy options include performance status, comorbidities, prognostic risk stratification, treatment adverse event profile, and mode of administration, with no Level I evidence for predictive biomarker use in clinic. Conclusions The treatment options for advanced RCC are rapidly evolving since the introduction of VEGF-targeted therapy, immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade and, more recently, combination regimens. Despite the success of these regimens, advanced RCC remains a largely incurable disease, and additional strategies are warranted. © 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Combined modality therapy is standard of care for patients with inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, insufficient data exist regarding what chemoradiotherapy combination will be the gold standard.AIM: The study aimed to compare the survival impact and side effects of concurrent versus sequential radiochemotherapy treatment in inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: To evaluate the treatment results and prognostic variables, 85 NSCLC patients treated from October 2005 to November 2008 were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms. In the first arm (sequential arm), 45 patients received sequential chemotherapy with 4 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide followed by conformal 3-dimensional (3D) radiotherapy (RT). In the second arm (concurrent arm), 40 patients received concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide and conformal RT, followed by two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposideRESULTS: The median survival was 13 months for the patients in the sequential arm and 19 months for those in the concurrent treatment arm (p = 0.0039). The disease-free survival (DFS) was 9 months in the sequential arm and 16 months in the concurrent treatment arm (p = 0.0023). Seven complete responses and 18 partial responses were obtained with sequential treatment. Twelve complete responses and 21 partial responses were obtained in concurrent arm. The differenced were statistically significant p = 0.03. Median survival for patients with complete response in concurrent treatment arm was 36 months versus 18 mounts for a sequential arm; partial response was 27 months versus 16 months and those with stable disease 11 months versus 9 months. Treatment-related toxicities were assessed according to the RTOG/EORTC criteria. Acute esophagitis and incidence of neutropenia were higher with the concurrent than with sequential treatment. Grade 3 esophagitis was characteristic only for concurrent treatment, and it was the reason for radiotherapy interruption, but no longer than 7 days. Secondary anaemia was more frequent in the sequential treatment arm.CONCLUSION: The statistically significant differences in survival were suggested that the concurrent chemotherapy and conformal three-dimensional radiotherapy is the optimal strategy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC with acceptable toxicity rates. © 2018 Simonida Crvenkova.",

    "Abstract": "Although polymeric micelles of paclitaxel (PTX) significantly reduce excipient-induced toxicity compared with Taxol, they exhibit few clinical advantages in tumor inhibition and overall survival. To improve, itraconazole (ITA), an antifungal drug with potent anti-angiogenesis activity, is co-encapsulated together with PTX within the PEG-PLA micelles. The strong intermolecular interactions between the payloads inhibit drug crystallization and prevent drugs from binding with external proteins, render super-stable micelles upon dilution and exposure to biological environment, and enter the tumor cells through endocytosis. The co-encapsulated micelles show strong anti-proliferation potency against non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and even PTX resistant NSCLC cells in vitro and significantly improve the drug accumulation within the tumor in vivo. Compared with PTX monotherapy or combination therapy using individual PTX and ITA micelles, the co-encapsulated micelle demonstrates strikingly superior efficacy in tumor growth inhibition, recurrence prevention, and reversion of PTX resistance, in Kras mutant patient derived xenografts, orthotropic models, and paclitaxel-resistance subcutaneous models. Besides the pharmacokinetic improvement, therapeutic benefits are also contributed by angiogenesis inhibition and blood vessel normalization by ITA. Utilizing the pharmaceutical and pharmacological synergies between the therapeutic agents, a simple yet effective design of a combination cancer nanomedicine that is industrially scalable and clinically translatable is achieved. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy is used for the treatment of all stages of breast cancer, including the metastatic stage of the disease. Treatment regimens are generally tailored for each patient′s particular situation. However, chemotherapeutic agents are the leading cause of serious drug-related adverse effects; moreover, drug resistance often occurs. In this study, we designed and synthesized a new series of N-alkylcarbazoles derived from ellipticine, an alkaloid with a carbazole skeleton initially used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and later dismissed because of poor aqueous solubility and severe side effects. After evaluating the binding modes of our class of newly synthesized compounds with human topoisomerase II (hTopo II), we performed hTopo II decatenation assays, identifying compound 4 f (2-(4-((3-chloro-9H-carbazol-9-yl)pentyl)piperazin-1-yl)-N,N,N-trimethylethanammonium iodide) as a good inhibitor. Moreover, 4 f and 4 g (2-(4-((3-chloro-9H-carbazol-9-yl)hexyl)piperazin-1-yl)-N,N,N-trimethylethanammonium iodide) showed a good anti-proliferative activity toward breast cancer cells, causing apoptosis by activation of the caspase pathway. Interestingly, the activity of these two compounds on triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, which tend to be highly metastatic and aggressive, is strictly connected to the observed inhibition of hTopo II. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Objective To evaluate the feasibility and safety of enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS) in elderly patients with colorectal cancer ( CRC) . Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 230 CRC patients undergoing ERAS from January 2017 to January 2018. These subjects included 120 young patients ( <70 years) and 110 elderly patients ( ≥=70 years) . The rates of ERAS compliance, anastomotic leakage, reoperation , and re-hospitalization, the mortality, and the average hospital stay were compared between these two groups. Results The elderly group had significantly higher incidences including diabetes (20. 9% vs. 10.8% , P = 0. 045) , heart disease (24. 5% vs. 11. 7% , P = 0. 039) , respiratory diseases (20. 0% vs. 10.0% , P = 0. 041) , and hypertension (26. 4% vs. 15. 0% , P =0. 035) than the young group. However, these two groups were not statistically significant in terms of ERAS compliance rate (79% in the young group vs. 74% in the elderly group, P =0. 574) , incidence of anastomotic leakage (2. 5% vs. 1. 8% , P = 1. 000) , re-operation rate (1.7% vs. 2.7%, P =0.672), re-hospitalization rate (2. 5% vs. 4.5%, P= 0.484), mortality rate within 30 days after operation (1. 7% vs. 2. 7% , P = 0. 672) . The average hospital stay was 5 days in the young group and 7 days in the elderly group ( P = 0. 000) . Conclusions Although the elderly patients tend to have poor general status, their ERAS compliance rate and main treatment indicators including incidence of anastomotic leakage, re-operation rate, re-hospitalization rate, and mortality rate within 30 days after surgery are not different from young patients. Thus, the ERAS program is safe and feasible for elderly CRC patients. © 2018 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. All Rights Reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Macrophage polarization is involved in the development of many diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer. This study aimed to understand the trends and hotspots of macrophage polarization research. Methods: We searched through the Web of Science Core Collection database to obtain original articles in this research domain. CiteSpace, HistCite, and VOSviewer software were used to facilitate the analysis and visualization of scientific productivity and emerging trends. Results: The survey included 3064 articles, and the annual number of publications exhibited an exponential increase. These articles have received a total of 74,801 citations, and the number of annual citations grew from 68 to 18,074 in a decade. Research on macrophage polarization was performed in 76 countries, and the USA ranked first in terms of research output by contributing 1129 (36.8%) articles. The USA also had the highest H-index, total citations, and highly cited article number. PLOS One, Journal of Immunology, and Scientific Reports were the three journals that published the most articles. Interdisciplinary research areas involving macrophage polarization, such as biomaterials, cancer, and diabetes, were identified by journal citation analysis. The top 20 most productive institutions were located mainly in the USA, France, and China, and top authors originated mainly from the USA and Italy. Tumor biology, obesity, and infection were research hotspots and may be promising in the next few years. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive analysis that delineates the scientific productivity, collaboration, and research hotspots of macrophage polarization research. © 2018 Chinese Medical Journal - Produced by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The preliminary results of our phase II randomized trial reported comparable functional sphincter preservation rates and short-term survival outcomes between patients undergoing total mesorectal excision (TME) with or without preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). We now report the long-term results after a median follow-up of 71 months. Methods: Between March 23, 2008 and August 2, 2012, 192 patients with T3-T4 or node-positive, resectable, mid/low rectal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to receive TME with or without preoperative CCRT. The following endpoints were assessed: cumulative rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: The data of 184 eligible patients were analyzed: 94 patients in the TME group and 90 patients in the CCRT + TME group. In the whole cohort, the 5-year DFS and OS rates were 84.8% and 85.1%, respectively. The 5-year DFS rates were 85.2% in the CCRT + TME group and 84.3% in the TME group (P = 0.969), and the 5-year OS rates were 83.5% in the CCRT + TME group and 86.5% in the TME group (P = 0.719). The 5-year cumulative rates of local recurrence were 6.3% and 5.0% (P = 0.681), and the 5-year cumulative rates of distant metastasis were 15.0% and 15.7% (P = 0.881) in the CCRT + TME and TME groups, respectively. No significant improvements in 5-year DFS and OS were observed with CCRT by subgroup analyses. Conclusions: Both treatment strategies yielded similar long-term outcomes. A selective policy towards preoperative CCRT is thus recommended for rectal cancer patients if high-quality TME surgery and enhanced chemotherapy can be performed.

    "Abstract": "Anti-tumor drug/stent combinations play a dual role of stent and local chemotherapy to cancer. Herein, a series of paclitaxel (PTX) loaded polylactic acid (PLA) stent films were studied on drug release characteristics and in vivo antitumor effects. The film was implanted beneath and released drug towards the subcutaneous PC-3 tumor xenograft in mice, which consisted of a PTX-loaded layer and a drug-free backing layer. The concentrations of PTX were 103–104 times higher than those in normal tissue or organs in 26 days after implantation of the 50% PTX/20% PEG-loaded film, indicating an extreme accumulation of PTX in tumor tissue. The tumor volumes kept unchanged for the initial 10 days after implantation of the PTX-loaded films and then increased slightly, implying tumor growth was remarkably inhibited. Moreover, the results showed that the drug release can be effectively modulated by addition of PEG in the drug-loaded layer, present an unidirectional way by adding a backing layer, and the drug films could arrest PC-3 prostate cancer cells in G2/M phase and induce apoptosis after 300 days of drug release. With the advantages of prolonged drug release and long-term effectiveness, the films have great potential for anti-tumor treatment by local administration. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Paraneoplastic syndromes (PS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases related to a neoplasm, indirectly dependent on it. Diagnosis and the treatment are often a challenge for clinicians, not least because the pathogenetic mechanisms are highly complex and not entirely known. Nonetheless, in most cases, PS precede the diagnosis of malignancies, thus their identification is particularly important in addressing physicians' diagnostic work-up with regard to early cancer diagnosis. Among paraneoplastic syndromes, those of rheumatologic interest represent a large component. In this paper, we review the main rheumatic PS.",

    "Abstract": "【中文题目：肺癌患者围手术期振动正压呼气训练有助于加速康复吗？】 【中文摘要：背景与目的 振动正压呼气（oscillatory positive expiratory pressure, OPEP）训练是一种通过正压呼气装置（acapella）进行的呼吸训练。OPEP在慢性阻塞性肺疾病、支气管扩张症、肺囊肿等疾病的临床价值已经得到广泛探讨，但其在肺癌手术患者围术期的应用价值尚有待探索。本研究旨在探索围术期进行振动正压呼气训练对胸腔镜肺癌患者术后并发症发生率、肺功能、生活质量的影响。方法 前瞻性收集2017年9月15日-2018年1月15日四川大学华西医院胸外科单个医疗组行胸腔镜肺叶切除的原发性非小细胞癌患者69例，随机分成实验组（35例）和对照组（34例）。实验组（acapella group, AG）围手术期采用振动正压呼气训练，对照组（control group, CG）进行常规围术期处理。对比分析两组在术后并发症发生率、肺功能、生活质量方面的差异。结果 术后肺部并发症和肺不张在AG（2.9%, 0.0%）显著低于CG（20.6%, 14.7%）（P=0.03, P=0.03）；平均住院日和术后住院日在AG（10.86±5.64, 5.09±4.55）d显著短于CG（14.41±4.58, 7.59±3.21）d（P=0.01, P=0.01）；住院药物费用在AG（4,413.60±1,772.35）¥显著低于CG（6,490.35±3,367.66）¥（P=0.01）。出院当日第1秒用力呼气容积（forced expiratory volume in the first second, FEV₁）和呼气峰流速（peak expiratory flow, PEF）在AG[(1.50±0.32) L, (252.06±75.27) L/min]显著高于CG[(1.34±0.19) L, (216.94±49.72) L/min]（P=0.03, P=0.03）。结论 肺癌患者围手术期使用振动正压呼气训练有助于降低肺部并发症，同时能够加速患者康复。 】 【中文关键词：振动正压呼气训练；正压呼气装置；肺肿瘤；胸腔镜肺叶切除术】.BACKGROUND: Oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) training is a kind of breathing exercise with Acapella. The clinical value of OPEP has been widely discussed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis as well as pulmonary cyst. However, few studies have explored the application of OPEP in surgery lung cancer patients underwent lobectomy. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the impact of the application of OPEP device (acapella) in lung cancer patients undergoing video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS). METHODS: Sixty-nine patients receiving VATS lobectomy in Department of Thoracic Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University from September 15, 2017 to January 15, 2018 were randomly divided into the acapella group (AG) or the control group (CG). The patients in the AG received oscillating positive expiratory pressure training and the CG underwent standard perioperative treatment. The differences of morbidity, pulmonary function, quality of life were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were assigned to the AG and thirty-four patients were assigned to the CG. The incidences of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and atelectasis (2.9%, 0.0%) in the AG were significantly lower than that in the CG (20.6%, 14.7%)(P=0.03, P=0.03). The duration of total hospital stay and postoperative hospital stay in the AG (10.86±5.64, 5.09±4.55) d were significantly shorter than that in the CG (10.86±5.64, 5.09±4.55) d (P=0.01, P=0.01). The drug cost in the AG (4,413.60±1,772.35) ¥ were significantly lower than that in the CG (6,490.35±3,367.66) ¥ (P=0.01). The patients in the AG had better forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow [(1.50±0.32) L,(252.06±75.27) L/min] compared with the CG [(1.34±0.19) L, (216.94±49.72) L/min] (P=0.03, P=0.03) at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The application of OPEP device during the perioperative period was valuable in decreasing PPCs and enhancing recovery for lung cancer patients receiving VATS lobectomy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Accurate population-based data regarding hospital-based care utilisation by older persons during their last year of life are important in health services planning. We investigated patterns of acute hospital-based service use at the end of life, amongst older decedents in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods: Data from all persons aged ≥70 years who died in the state of NSW Australia in 2007 were included. Several measures of hospital-based service utilisation during the last year of life were assessed from retrospectively linked data comprising data for all registered deaths, cause of death, hospital care during the last year of life (NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection [APDC] and Emergency Department [ED] Data Collection [EDDC]), and the NSW Cancer Registry. Results: Amongst 34,556 decedents aged ≥70 years, 82% (n = 28,366) had ≥1 hospitalisation during the last year of life (median 2), and 21% > 3 hospitalisations. Twenty-five percent (n = 5485) of decedents attended ED during the last week of life. Overall, 21% had a hospitalisation > 30 days in the last year of life, and 7% spent > 3 months in hospital; 79% had ≥1 ED attendance, 17% > 3. Nine percent (n = 3239) spent time in an intensive care unit. Fifty-three percent (n = 18,437) died in an inpatient setting. Hospital records had referenced palliative care for a fifth (7169) of decedents. Adjusting for age group, sex, place of residence, area-level socioeconomic status, and cause of death, having > 3 hospitalisations during the last year of life was more likely for persons dying from cancer (35% versus 16% non-cancer deaths, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.33), 'younger' old decedents (29% for age 70-79 and 20% for age 80-89 versus 11% for 90+, aOR 2.42 and 1.77 respectively) and males (25% versus 17% females, aOR 1.38). Patterns observed for other hospital-based service use were similar. Conclusions: This population-based study reveals high use of hospital care among older persons during their last year of life, although this decreased with increasing older age, providing important data to inform health services planning for this population, and highlighting aspects requiring further study. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Mortison et al. identified the human ribosome as a target of the tetracycline analogs Col-3 and doxycycline and mapped the binding sites for these tetracyclines to unique rRNA substructures. The authors show that Col-3 and doxycycline inhibit human ribosomal translation and activate the cellular integrated stress response. © 2018 Elsevier LtdApart from their antimicrobial properties, tetracyclines demonstrate clinically validated effects in the amelioration of pathological inflammation and human cancer. Delineation of the target(s) and mechanism(s) responsible for these effects, however, has remained elusive. Here, employing quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified human 80S ribosomes as targets of the tetracyclines Col-3 and doxycycline. We then developed in-cell click selective crosslinking with RNA sequence profiling (icCL-seq) to map binding sites for these tetracyclines on key human rRNA substructures at nucleotide resolution. Importantly, we found that structurally and phenotypically variant tetracycline analogs could chemically discriminate these rRNA binding sites. We also found that tetracyclines both subtly modify human ribosomal translation and selectively activate the cellular integrated stress response (ISR). Together, the data reveal that targeting of specific rRNA substructures, activation of the ISR, and inhibition of translation are correlated with the anti-proliferative properties of tetracyclines in human cancer cell lines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The phase 3 AETHERA trial established brentuximab vedotin (BV) as a consolidative treatment option for adult patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) at high risk of relapse or progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). Results showed that BV significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) vs placebo plus best supportive care alone. At 5-year follow-up, BV continued to provide patients with sustained PFS benefit; 5-year PFS was 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51-66) with BV vs 41% (95% CI, 33-49) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.521; 95% CI, 0.379-0.717). Similarly, patients with ‡2 risk factors in the BV arm experienced significantly higher PFS at 5 years than patients in the placebo arm (HR, 0.424; 95% CI, 0.302-0.596). Upfront consolidation with BV significantly delayed time to second subsequent therapy, an indicator of ongoing disease control, vs placebo. Peripheral neuropathy, the most common adverse event in patients receiving BV, continued to improve and/or resolve in 90% of patients. In summary consolidation with BV in adult patients with cHL at high risk of relapse or progression after auto-HSCT confers a sustained PFS benefit and is safe and well tolerated. Physicians should consider each patient's HL risk factor profile when making treatment decisions. © 2018 by The American Society of Hematology",

    "Abstract": "Lim et al. identify a key function of a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP1, in replication in BRCA1-deficient tumors. USP1 localizes to replication forks and promotes their stabilization in BRCA1-deficient cells. Loss of USP1 results in reduced cell survival and replication fork degradation, suggesting that USP1 inhibitors may be useful in treating BRCA1-deficient tumors. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.BRCA1-deficient tumor cells have defects in homologous-recombination repair and replication fork stability, resulting in PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that a deubiquitinase, USP1, is upregulated in tumors with mutations in BRCA1. Knockdown or inhibition of USP1 resulted in replication fork destabilization and decreased viability of BRCA1-deficient cells, revealing a synthetic lethal relationship. USP1 binds to and is stimulated by fork DNA. A truncated form of USP1, lacking its DNA-binding region, was not stimulated by DNA and failed to localize and protect replication forks. Persistence of monoubiquitinated PCNA at the replication fork was the mechanism of cell death in the absence of USP1. Taken together, USP1 exhibits DNA-mediated activation at the replication fork, protects the fork, and promotes survival in BRCA1-deficient cells. Inhibition of USP1 may be a useful treatment for a subset of PARP-inhibitor-resistant BRCA1-deficient tumors with acquired replication fork stabilization. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Essential oils containing monoterpenes are widely used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products on account of their wide range of bioactive properties (including anti-cancer activity). Two monoterpenes (citral and geraniol) were firstly tested for their anti-inflammatory activity in a RAW 264.7 cell line, demonstrating citral to have enhanced capacity to inhibit NO production (ca. 84% for citral and 52% for geraniol at the lowest tested concentration of 5 µg/ml). As citral showed higher NO inhibitory activity than geraniol, to measure the level of cytotoxicity of citral, AlamarBlue reduction assay was run in two cell models (non-tumoral HaCaT and tumoral A431). Citral exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect in both cell lines, i.e. cell viability lower that 10% after 24 h exposure at 100 µg/ml of monoterpene. An optimized solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) formulation for citral was further developed by design of experiments (22 factorial design), followed by accelerated stability testing (LUMiSizer®). An optimal SLN composed of 1 wt% of citral, 4 wt% of lipid and 2.5 wt% surfactant were successfully produced by hot high pressure homogenization (hot HPH) showing a mean particle size (Z-Ave) of 97.7 nm and polydispersity index of 0.249. The produced formulations were analyzed in a high-end dispersion analyzer LUMiSizer® to characterize any demixing phenomena, demonstrating to be long-term stable at room temperature (25 °C), exhibiting very low instability indices (0.032 after production and 0.042 after one month of storage). © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Cure rate models have been widely studied to analyze time-to-event data with a cured fraction of patients. Our proposal consists of incorporating frailty into a cure rate model, as an alternative to the existing models to describe this type of data, based on the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Such a distribution has theoretical arguments to model medical data and has shown empirically to be a good option for their analysis. An advantage of the proposed model is the possibility to jointly consider the heterogeneity among patients by their frailties and the presence of a cured fraction of them. In addition, the number of competing causes is described by the negative binomial distribution, which absorbs several particular cases. We consider likelihood-based methods to estimate the model parameters and to derive influence diagnostics for this model. We assess local influence on the parameter estimates under different perturbation schemes. Deriving diagnostic tools is needed in all statistical modeling, which is another novel aspect of our proposal. Numerical evaluation of the considered model is performed by Monte Carlo simulations and by an illustration with melanoma data, both of which show its good performance and its potential applications. Particularly, the illustration confirms the importance of statistical diagnostics in the modeling. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNA (IneRNA) refer to transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that have a low coding potential. Autophagy, a unique life phenomenon of eukaryotic cells, removes excess or damaged organelles during cell growth and development and plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis. As a key regulator of cellular metabolism, IncRNA are involved in disease treatment by regulating autophagy. This article summarizes the role of IncRNA in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and bacterial infections and analyzes the molecular mechanisms of IncRNA in regulating autophagy, along with prospects of its applications in other areas. © 2018 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Background: Ventana ALK (D5F3) screening of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement in tissue specimens has been approved by US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to select treatment for non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, tumor tissues are often not readily obtainable, and cytology specimens and may be the only tumor material available for diagnosis and molecular marker analysis. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of ALK immunocytochemistry (ICC) on ThinPrep slides and determined a suitable scoring system for interpretation of the results. Methods: One hundred twenty-one fine-needle aspirate (FNA) specimens from metastatic lesions of NSCLC were analyzed. ALK rearrangement was detected on ThinPrep cytology slides using the Ventana immunocytochemistry ALK-D5F3 system, which adopts two scoring systems for interpretation of the ICC results. The results were subsequently confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Among the 121 ICC specimens, 16 that were considered ALK-positive by either scoring system were referred for PCR analysis. Among the ALK ICC-negative cases, 33 had correlated FISH ALK results. A total of 49 specimens that exhibited either a positive or negative ICC result with a correlated ALK status were analyzed statistically. ICC results showed a high concordance rate with the results of PCR/FISH analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of ALK ICC by the binary scoring algorithm were 68.75 and 96.97%, respectively. These values increased to 93.75 and 96.97%, respectively, when interpreted by the semiquantified interpretation system. Conclusions: ALK ICC analysis on ThinPrep slides is a reliable ALK testing method, and the semiquantified interpretation system on cytology specimens is recommended rather than the binary scoring algorithm on tissue specimens. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "MiRNA is reported as an important biomarker candidate and therapeutic target in a variety of diseases and cancers. However, ultrasensitive, straightforward, isothermal, low-cost and credible methods for the detection of miRNA from clinical specimens still remain challenges. Here, we establish an isothermal, highly sensitive and specific method for miRNA analysis based on a novel ligation-promoted hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (L-HRCA). This strategy exhibits 103-fold sensitivity enhancement compared to T4 ligase-assisted target-primer BRCA. The excellent specificity of L-HRCA allows for discriminating target miRNA from negative miRNAs. This method is applied to analyse the expression level of miR-21 in hepatocellular carcinoma. These results indicated that the L-HRCA strategy will become a promising tool to quantify miRNA in early clinical diagnostics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The combretastatins have attracted significant interest as small-molecule therapies for cancer due to their ability to function as vascular disrupting agents. We have successfully prepared a range of combretastatin analogues that are based on a novel sydnone heterocycle core, and their potential as tubulin binders has been assessed in vitro and in vivo. The most potent candidate was found to disrupt microtubules and affect cellular morphology at sub-micromolar levels. Moreover, it was found to bind reversibly to tubulin and significantly increase endothelial cell monolayer permeability, in a similar manner to combretastatin A4. Surprisingly, the compound did not exhibit efficacy in vivo, possibly due to rapid metabolism. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",

    "Abstract": "FDA approval of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) adjuvants for a human hepatitis B virus vaccine has been delayed until late 2017 because of concerns regarding the severe side effects, which may be attributed to the high dosage and systemic diffusion of this proinflammatory material. Considering that PLGA could provide shelter to resist nucleases in tissue and that cationic lipids could confine anionic oligonucleotides in the nanoparticles via electrostatic attraction to avoid systemic diffusion, we encapsulated a natural phosphodiester or the expensive phosphorothioate CpG ODNs in our previously reported hyaluronic acid-modified cationic lipid-PLGA hybrid nanoparticles and evaluated vaccine efficacy in a TC-1-grafted mouse model. Our results showed that together with Poly I:C, CpG ODN could promote the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and the cross-presentation of exogenous antigens in vitro. For the coencapsulation with Poly I:C, in vivo studies showed that adjuvant effects on the vaccine efficacy of tumor depression, immune cell activation, and memory T-cell elevation of phosphodiester CpG ODNs were comparable to those of the phosphorothioate CpG ODNs at a low concentration (5 µg/dose). In conclusion, the combination of oligonucleotide adjuvants and synthetic particulate systems not only potentiated the immunogenicity of these nanoparticles but also made these adjuvants safer and more economical, which may be helpful for their wide application. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Decision-making concerning the treatment of choroid plexus tumor (CPT) in pediatric patients remains a topic of considerable debate. The aim of this work was to describe clinical features and prognostic risk factors of CPT in the pediatric population and to provide theoretical opinions regarding clinical decisions for CPT. Methods: The data of 96 patients with CPT and younger than 14 years were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics such as pathological type of CPTs, rate and severity of hydrocephalus, treatment and outcome, and recurrence were investigated. For categorical variables, the Pearson's Chi-square test was performed. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for comparisons between nonnormally distributed parameters. Log-rank test was used for progression-free survival (PFS). Results: The study included 70 choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) cases, 17 atypical choroid plexus papilloma (aCPP) cases, and 9 choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) cases. Compared with patients with CPP or aCPP, patients with CPC had a shorter disease course (median: CPP, 4 months; aCPP, 2 months; CPC, 1 month; H: 23.5, P &lt; 0.001), higher rate of acute hydrocephalus (CPP, 27.1%; aCPP, 52.9%; CPC, 77.8%; χ 2 = 10.9, P &lt; 0.05), and lower incidence of cure rate (CPP, 85.7%; aCPP, 70.5%; CPC, 33.3%; χ 2 = 13.5, P &lt; 0.05). The severity of hydrocephalus with tumor in the lateral or third ventricle was significantly higher than that with tumors in the fourth ventricle (severe hydrocephalus: lateral ventricle, 51.7%; third ventricle, 47.0%; fourth ventricle, 11.1%; χ 2 = 26.0, P &lt; 0.001). Patients with gross total surgical resection had no better PFS than those with partial resection because of the use of adjuvant therapy in the latter (χ 2 = 4.0, P &gt; 0.05). Patients with CPC experienced shorter time for recurrence than those with CPP or aCPP (χ 2 = 40.1, P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Our results indicated that CPP in the fourth ventricle could trigger serious clinical symptoms at an early stage, requiring early intervention. Adjuvant treatment might be necessary for patients with partially resected CPP, aCPP, and CPC to achieve a favorable outcome. © 2018 Chinese Medical Journal - Produced by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",

    "Abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common renal cell carcinoma subtype, and metastatic ccRCC is associated with 5-year survival rates of 10% to 20%. Genetically, ccRCC originates from sequential losses of multiple tumor suppressor genes. Remarkably, chromosome 3p loss occurs in more than 90% of sporadic ccRCCs. This results in concurrent one-copy loss of four tumor suppressor genes that are also mutated individually at high frequency in ccRCC (ie, VHL, 80%; PBRM1, 29% to 46%; BAP1, 6% to 19%; and SETD2, 8% to 30%). Pathogenically, 3p loss probably represents the first genetic event that occurs in sporadic ccRCC and the second genetic event in VHL-mutated hereditary ccRCC. VHL constitutes the substrate recognition module of the VCB-Cul2 E3 ligase that degrades HIF1/2a, whereas PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2 are epigenetic modulators that regulate gene transcription. Because 3p loss and VHL inactivation are nearly universal truncal events in ccRCC, the resulting HIF1/2 signaling overdrive and accompanied tumor hyper-vascularization probably underlie the therapeutic benefits observed with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors, including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, bevacizumab, cabo-zantinib, and lenvatinib. Furthermore, recent marked advances in ccRCC genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, molecular mechanisms, mouse models, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and clinical trials have rendered invaluable translational insights concerning precision kidney cancer therapeutics. With an armamentarium encompassing 13 drugs that exploit seven unique therapeutic mechanisms (ie, cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, mTORC1, cMET/AXL, fibroblast growth factor receptor, programmed cell death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1, and cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte associated-4) to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma, one of the imminent clinical questions concerning care of patients with metastatic ccRCC is how a personalized treatment strategy, through rationally combining and sequencing different therapeutic modalities, can be formulated to offer the best clinical outcome for individual patients. Here, we attempt to integrate recent discoveries of immediate translational impacts and discuss future translational challenges and opportunities. © 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",

    "Abstract": "Paclitaxel-loading micelles are prepared via dialysis method using a pH-sensitive imine bond polymer 6-β-CD-N-(CH 2 ) 17 -CH 3 that is synthesized by Schiff base reaction between 6-CHO-β-CD and octadecylamine.The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the polymer is measured by means of Pyrene fluorescent probe technique.The particle size,morphology,encapsulation efficiency and drug loading amount are determined.The release of drug-loading micelles at different pH values is investigated by UV spectrophotometry.It is indicated that CMC,entrapment efficiency and drug-loading amount of the micelles are 3.98×10 -2 g•L -1 ,34.3±1.0% and 1.97±0.3%,respectively.Paclitaxel-loading micelle is rod-like with an average particle size of 261.6 nm.The release rates of paclitaxel under acidic condition (pH=5.0) are significantly higher than in the physiological medium (pH=7.4) and there is a burst after 72 h,which can achieve the curable effect of targeting cancer cells under acidic conditions.The rod-like micelles formed by self-assembly of 6-β-CD-N-(CH 2 ) 17 -CH 3 have certain pH-sensitive properties. © 2018, China National Chemical Information Center.

    "Abstract": "Background: Venipuncture is described by children as one of the most painful and frightening medical procedures. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) as a distraction technique to help control pain in children and adolescents undergoing venipuncture. Methods: Using a within-subjects design, fifteen patients (mean age 10.92, SD = 2.64) suffering from oncological or hematological diseases received one venipuncture with \"No VR\" and one venipuncture with \"Yes VR\" on two separate days (treatment order randomized). \"Time spent thinking about pain\", \"Pain Unpleasantness\", \"Worst pain\" the quality of VR experience, fun during the venipuncture and nausea were measured. Results: During VR, patients reported significant reductions in \"Time spent thinking about pain,\" \"Pain unpleasantness,\" and \"Worst pain\". Patients also reported significantly more fun during VR, and reported a \"Strong sense of going inside the computer-generated world\" during VR. No side effects were reported. Conclusion: VR can be considered an effective distraction technique for children and adolescents' pain management during venipuncture. Moreover, VR may elicit positive emotions, more than traditional distraction techniques. This could help patients cope with venipuncture in a non-stressful manner. Additional research and development is needed. © 2018 Atzori, Hoffman, Vagnoli, Patterson, Alhalabi, Messeri and Lauro Grotto.",

    "Abstract": "Background: When genomics researchers design a high-throughput study to test for differential expression, some biological systems and research questions provide opportunities to use paired samples from subjects, and researchers can plan for a certain proportion of subjects to have paired samples. We consider the effect of this paired samples proportion on the statistical power of the study, using characteristics of both count (RNA-Seq) and continuous (microarray) expression data from a colorectal cancer study. Results: We demonstrate that a higher proportion of subjects with paired samples yields higher statistical power, for various total numbers of samples, and for various strengths of subject-level confounding factors. In the design scenarios considered, the statistical power in a fully-paired design is substantially (and in many cases several times) greater than in an unpaired design. Conclusions: For the many biological systems and research questions where paired samples are feasible and relevant, substantial statistical power gains can be achieved at the study design stage when genomics researchers plan on using paired samples from the largest possible proportion of subjects. Any cost savings in a study design with unpaired samples are likely accompanied by underpowered and possibly biased results. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) is a rare, low-grade, malignant tumor that constitutes less than one percent of all salivary gland tumors. To date, only one other case report has described radiation-associated EMC in the English language medical literature. CASE SUMMARY In this report, we describe the case of a 56-year-old male patient who presented with a neck mass diagnosed as EMC of the left submandibular gland approximately 30 years after mantle field radiation and chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment included resection, re-resection with nodal dissection, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. This patient was also diagnosed with 4 other secondary malignancies, including stage IV diffuse large B cell lymphoma in the abdomen with subsequent brain metastases, low-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung, Hurthle cell adenoma, and small B cell lymphoma before the patient expired. This case provides important information regarding the pathology, clinical sequelae, and management of a patient diagnosed with radiation-associated EMC amidst four concurrent malignancies. CONCLUSION Further investigation is needed on the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy in EMC, especially atypical EMC. ©The Author(s) 2018. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

    "Abstract": "Epigenetic control of gene expression occurs within discrete spatial chromosomal units called topologically associating domains (TADs), but the exact spatial requirements of most genes are unknown; this is of particular interest for genes involved in cancer. We therefore applied high-resolution chromosomal conformation capture sequencing to map the three-dimensional (3D) organization of the human locus encoding the key myeloid transcription factor PU.1 in healthy monocytes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We identified a dynamic ∼75-kb unit (SubTAD) as the genomic region in which spatial interactions between PU.1 gene regulatory elements occur during myeloid differentiation and are interrupted in AML. Within this SubTAD, proper initiation of the spatial chromosomal interactions requires PU.1 autoregulation and recruitment of the chromatin-adaptor protein LDB1 (LIM domain–binding protein 1). However, once these spatial interactions have occurred, LDB1 stabilizes them independently of PU.1 autoregulation. Thus, our data support that PU.1 autoregulates its expression in a “hit-and-run” manner by initiating stable chromosomal loops that result in a transcriptionally active chromatin architecture. © 2018 by The American Society of Hematology",

    "Abstract": "In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods for telomerase activity detection of time-consuming and susceptibility to interferences in cell extracts, here, we develop a semiconductor quantum dots-streptavidin conjugates (QDs-SA)-based biosensor for sensitive detection of telomerase activity. In the absence of telomerase, the aggregation and thus the fluorescence quenching of QDs-SA can be observed in buffer solution due to charge shielding effect. In the presence of telomerase and biotin-dATP, QDs-SA will bind to telomerase elongation products due to the high affinity between the biotin and streptavidin, protecting the QDs-SA from aggregation and retaining their strong fluorescence. This sensor exhibited good fluorescence responses toward telomerase activity from HeLa cells in the range of 40–1000 cells with a detection limit of 13 cells or A549 cells within the linear range of 20–500 cells with a detection limit of 9 cells. Furthermore, the sensor can be used to efficiently monitor the evolution of telomerase activity in living cells, demonstrating great potential in tumor diagnosis and inhibitor drug screening. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Alteration of glycosphingolipid (GSL) expression plays key roles in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of many important human diseases, including cancer, diabetes and glycosphingolipidosis. Inflammatory processes are involved in development and progression of diabetic nephropathy, a major complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. GSLs are known to play roles in inflammatory responses in various diseases, and levels of renal GSLs are elevated in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy; however, little is known regarding the pathophysiological role of these GSLs in this disease process. We studied proinflammatory activity of GSLs in diabetic nephropathy using spontaneously diabetic mouse strain KK. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (60% kcal from fat) or normal diet (ND) (4.6% kcal from fat) for a period of 8 wk. HFD-feeding resulted in quantitative and qualitative changes of renal globo-series GSLs (particularly Gb3Cer), upregulation of TNF-α, and induction of renal inflammation. Gb3Cer/Gb4Cer treatment enhanced inflammatory responses via TLR4 in TLR4/MD-2 complex expressing cells, including HEK293T, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human monocytes. Our findings suggest that HFD-induced increase of Gb3Cer/Gb4Cer positively modulate TLR4-mediated inflammatory response, and that such GSLs play an important pathophysiological role in diabetic nephropathy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A 63-year-old man was pointed out with a mediastinal tumor on chest computed tomography (CT). On positron emission tomography-CT, fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.70 was seen in this tumor. Scar-like nodule was found in the apex of the right lung, but no abnormal accumulation was observed in this nodule. The level of carcinoembryonic antigen was abnormally elevated. We performed mediastinal tumorectomy under thoracoscopic surgery. Since arterial oxygen saturation fell during intraoperative one-lung ventilation, we finished the surgery without resection of right apex nodule. Histologically, mediastinal tumor was diagnosed as metastatic adenocarcinoma in lymph node. Because immunohistochemical staining suggested lung adenocarcinoma as the primary site, the right apex nodule was resected. Pathological diagnosis of this nodule was scar fibrosis. No other malignant lesions were detected, and therefore we finally diagnosed this tumor as mediastinal lymph node carcinoma of unknown primary site. The patient was given adjuvant chemotherapy, and at present, 37 months after surgery, the patient remains free of the disease.",

    "Abstract": "Polymeric micelles, which form through the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(amino acid) block copolymers, are systemic nanocarriers in targeted cancer therapy. These micelles can encapsulate therapeutic compounds, such as lipophilic substances, charged compounds, and metal complexes, that have characteristics of increased solubility, sustained release, and improved tissue distribution. However, few studies have been conducted on the local distribution of polymeric micelles. Thus, we evaluated the skin penetration pattern of hydrophobic drugs in polymeric micelles. We revealed that improved water solubility by the encapsulation of the hydrophobic drugs indomethacin and resveratrol in polymeric micelles significantly increased the amount of drugs penetrating into the skin. Moreover, polymeric micelles did not enhance the permeability of drugs. Furthermore, although the polymers remained on or in the stratum corneum, the encapsulated drugs gradually moved deeper into the skin. These results indicate that encapsulated hydrophobic drugs in polymeric micelles can penetrate the living cell layer of the skin without bringing about unexpected side effects associated with other ingredients in the formulation. Thus, polymeric micelles for encapsulating hydrophobic drugs can be used for skin applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Lipid–porphyrin conjugates are considered nowadays as promising building blocks for the conception of supramolecular structures with multifunctional properties, required for efficient cancer therapy by photodynamic therapy (PDT). The synthesis of two new lipid–porphyrin conjugates coupling pheophorbide-a (Pheo-a), a photosensitizer derived from chlorophyll-a, to either chemically modified lyso-phosphatidylcholine (PhLPC) or egg lyso-sphingomyelin (PhLSM) is reported. The impact of the lipid backbone of these conjugates on their self-assembling properties, as well as on their physicochemical properties, including interfacial behavior at the air/buffer interface, fluorescence and absorption properties, thermotropic behavior, and incorporation rate in the membrane of liposomes were studied. Finally, their photodynamic activity was evaluated on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and normal esophageal squamous epithelium cell lines. The liposome-like vesicles resulting from self-assembly of the pure conjugates were unstable and turned into aggregates with undefined structure within few days. However, both lipid–porphyrin conjugates could be efficiently incorporated in lipid vesicles, with higher loading rates than unconjugated Pheo-a. Interestingly, phototoxicity tests of free and liposome-incorporated lipid–porphyrin conjugates demonstrated a better selectivity in vitro to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma relative to normal cells. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Small molecules offer powerful ways to alter protein function. However, most proteins in the human proteome lack small-molecule probes, including the large class of non-catalytic transmembrane receptors, such as death receptors. We hypothesized that small molecules targeting the interfaces between transmembrane domains (TMDs) in receptor complexes may induce conformational changes that alter receptor function. Applying this concept in a screening assay, we identified a compound targeting the TMD of death receptor p75 NTR that induced profound conformational changes and receptor activity. The compound triggered apoptotic cell death dependent on p75 NTR and JNK activity in neurons and melanoma cells, and inhibited tumor growth in a melanoma mouse model. Due to their small size and crucial role in receptor activation, TMDs represent attractive targets for small-molecule manipulation of receptor function. © 2018 Elsevier LtdSmall molecules offer powerful ways to alter protein function. However, most proteins in the human proteome lack small-molecule probes. Goh et al. Identified a small molecule that interacts with the transmembrane domain of death receptor p75 NTR , which induces melanoma cell death, and inhibits melanoma tumor growth in vivo. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Paclitaxel (PTX), one of the most potent anticancer agents, has showed a remarkable activity against varieties of tumors. However, the bioavailability of PTX is quite low due to its poor aqueous solubility. Moreover, the emerging multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer to PTX remains a major obstacle for successful chemotherapy. In order to address these problems, we developed self-assembly of biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(curcumin) (Biotin-PEG-PCDA) for PTX delivery (termed as PTX-BPC NPs) with the application of mPEG 2K -P(CL-co-LLA) as an emulsifier. The loading content and encapsulation efficiency of PTX were 13.2% and 92.0%, respectively. In vitro drug release study showed that PTX-BPC NPs could degrade rapidly and then release the PTX payload in a 10 mM glutathione (GSH) environment. Compared with free PTX, PTX-BPC NPs exhibited enhanced anticancer efficacy (IC 50(MCF-7/ADR cells) , 17.28 µg/mL vs. 1.15 µg/mL). In addition, these biotin-modified nanoparticles could also significantly reverse PTX resistance by suppressing the over-expression of P-gp, thus resulting in increased intracellular drug accumulation and reduced drug efflux in MCF-7/ADR cells, which showed a great anticancer effect. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: Development of biocompatible multifunctional polymeric drug carriers is crucial in modern pharmaceutics aimed to create \"smart\" drugs. The high potential of the PEGylated comb-like polymeric nanocarrier (PNC) in delivering both traditional and experimental drugs to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo has been demonstrated previously. In the present study, we investigated the general toxicity of polyethylene glycol (PEG) processed with both covalent and non-covalent attachments of PEG to compose a comb-like polymer that behaves like a simple chain of n monomers decorated with swollen side chains. The PNC possesses properties of a water-soluble surfactant containing methyl-terminated PEG side branches in some monomer units attached covalently to the carbon chain backbone. Results: We have demonstrated that the synthesized PNC possesses weak toxic effects toward human leukemia cells (HL-60 and Jurkat lines), as well as toward hepatocellular (HepG2), colon (HCT116) and breast (MCF-7) tumor cell lines. Additionally, after a long period (20 days) of intraperitoneal administration, the PNC had no significant toxic effects in laboratory white mice (470 mg/kg body mass in 1 ml) and Wistar rats (440 mg/kg body mass in 10 ml). Conclusion: The developed PNC we studied can be qualified as a compound of grade 4 toxicity (low toxicity substance). The reduced toxicity of this PNC in combination with its improved bioavailability and previously detected capability to enhance cytotoxicity toward tumor cells in vitro and potential tumor treatment effects in vivo suggests its potential as a safe drug delivery platform for treating various diseases, especially cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Alterations of mental status are characteristic of psychiatric disorders but may also result from a multitude of organic causes. Generally, physical examination and blood analysis are a part of basic psychiatric differential diagnostics, whereas more sophisticated procedures (for example, brain imaging) are applied only in cases with pathologic diagnostic findings. Our report challenges this approach by describing a case of glioblastoma multiforme presenting as postpartum depression without abnormalities in basic differential diagnostics. Case presentation: A 28-year-old white woman who had been in outpatient treatment for postpartum depression was taken to the psychiatric emergency room. The psychopathological assessment, however, showed mild disorientation and severe deficits of long-term memory. Moreover, she complained of stabbing, bilateral headaches, but results of her physical examination and blood analysis were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed, which showed a contrast-enhanced mass lesion in the left frontal lobe. The patient underwent urgent tumor resection, and histologic results revealed an IDH-mutant glioblastoma multiforme. The patient was discharged with a substantially improved psychopathology and without neurological deficits. Conclusions: This report adds to the evidence that postpartum depression may have organic causes in some cases, a fact that needs to be considered in the clinical setting. Atypical neurocognitive findings in a psychiatric interview may alone justify brain imaging, despite normal physical examination and blood analysis results. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Curcumin, a low molecular weight, hydrophobic compound, exhibits strong anti-cancer effects and has a high margin of safety. However, its poor water solubility, rapid metabolism and degradation make it relatively ineffective, but intracellular delivery using nanoparticles (NPs) would solve these problems. In this study, we formulated curcumin in two-structurally distinct NPs: a nanoemulsion (Cur-NE) and a Niosome (Cur-NIO), evaluated their in-vitro cytotoxic effects and examined their mechanisms of drug delivery. The use of Cur-NIO resulted in an unexpected increase in the intracellular accumulation of curcumin and induced a potent cytotoxic effect compared to Cur-NE. To our surprise, however, the effects of the endocytosis of NIO as well as that for NE on the cellular delivery of curcumin were negligible. Consequently, we concluded that Cur-NIO delivers curcumin directly to the cytosol via transfer from the NIO to the cell membrane. The results of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and phase-transfer studies indicate that Cur-NIO exhibits efficient transfer into model membranes or organic interfaces. Moreover, we found that Cur-NE shows a poor transfer efficiency. This could be due to the presence of a hydrophobic oil core that reduces the probability of curcumin to transfer upon contact with the membrane. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the effect of NP structure on the membrane-mediated transfer efficiency of low molecular weight, hydrophobic compounds. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BRAF is the most frequently mutated gene in skin melanoma. Applying BRAF siRNA (siBraf) to silencing BRAF gene is a current frontline therapy for melanoma. However, delivery of macromolecular siRNA into the tumor site and introduction of siRNA into the tumor cells remain as challenges. In this study, we for the first time developed a siBraf delivery system based on cell penetrating peptide octaarginine (R8) nanocomplexes combined with coated microneedles (MNs), i.e. R8/siBraf coated MNs, for targeted anti–melanoma treatment. The R8/siBraf nanocomplexes were optimized based on the internalization of siBraf by A375 cells. In vitro A375 cell experiments presented that R8/siBraf can enhance siBraf transfection, silence BRAF gene, and inhibit tumor cells growth, comparable to polyethylenimine (PEI)/siBraf. R8/siBraf coated MNs can effectively deliver R8/siBraf into the disease site. In vivo anti-melanoma experiments indicated that R8/siBraf coated MNs can significantly inhibit the melanoma development, induce the tumor cells apoptosis, and suppress their proliferation. The BRAF gene in tumor were also significantly silenced in vivo. SiBraf intradermal delivery via combining MNs and R8 nanocomplexes is a promising approach for skin melanoma treatment, which exploited both virtues of MNs and cell penetrating peptide to obtain the targeting inhibition efficacy on skin melanoma. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to analyze epigenetically and genetically altered genes in melanoma to get a better understanding of the molecular circuitry of melanoma and identify potential gene targets for the treatment of melanoma. The microarray data of GSE31879, including mRNA expression profiles (seven melanoma and four melanocyte samples) and DNA methylation profiles (seven melanoma and five melanocyte samples), were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were screened using the linear models for microarray data (limma) package in melanoma compared with melanocyte samples. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs were carried out using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Moreover, differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified, and a transcriptional regulatory network was constructed using the University of California Santa Cruz genome browser database. A total of 1,215 DEGs (199 upregulated and 1,016 downregulated) and 14,094 DMPs (10,450 upregulated and 3,644 downregulated) were identified in melanoma compared with melanocyte samples. Additionally, the upregulated and downregulated DEGs were significantly associated with different GO terms and pathways, such as pigment cell differentiation, biosynthesis, and metabolism. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulatory network showed that DMGs such as Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX), damage-specific DNA binding protein 2 (DDB2), and myelin basic protein (MBP) had higher node degrees. Our results showed that several methylated genes (ARX, DDB2, and MBP) may be involved in melanoma progression. © 2018 Duan et al.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) is an independent predictive factor of clinical outcome of acute ischemic stroke and cancer, but the predictive effect of LMR in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the impact of peripheral LMR on the neurological deterioration (ND) during the initial week after spontaneous ICH onset, as well as 90-day mortality. Material/Method: The clinical data of 558 consecutive patients with ICH were retrospectively analyzed. LMR is calculated by absolute lymphocyte count divided by absolute monocyte count. Results: Of these patients, 166 patients experienced ND during the first week after admission and 72 patients died within 90 days. Multivariate analysis indicated that white blood cells (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), LMR were significantly associated with ND during the initial week after ICH onset and also were associated with 90-day mortality. Moreover, NLR and LMR showed a higher predictive ability in ND during the initial week after ICH onset than 90-day mortality in receiver operating characteristic analysis. The best cut-off points of NLR and LMR in predicting ND and 90-day mortality were 10.24 and 2.21 and 16.81 and 2.19, respectively. Conclusions: Our results suggest that LMR on admission is a predictive factor for ND during the initial week after ICH onset, as well as 90-day mortality. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Curcumin (CUR) chewing gums have potential therapeutic benefits to head and neck cancer patients. The objective of this work was to develop medicated chewing gums (MCGs) with high CUR loading and desirable mastication properties. This was accomplished by evaluating the effect of five gum ingredients: (X1) polyisobutene, (X2) polyvinyl acetate, (X3) wood rosin, (X4) wax, and (X5) CUR on the mechanical properties of the MCGs using a 25-run, five-factor, two-level D-Optimal mixture design. CUR MCGs were prepared by the conventional fusion method for making chewing gums. They were characterized by a two-bites texture and uniaxial tension tests to generate force–displacement curves from which the cohesiveness (Y1), springiness (Y2), chewiness (Y3), compressibility (Y4), resistance to extension (Y5), and extensibility (Y6) were measured. Observed responses were used to generate polynomial models correlating the independent with the dependent variables. Elasticity and stiffness of the gums were found to be readily impacted by PIB and CUR levels. Fitted models were then used to predict a gum composition that has comparable mechanical properties to commercially procured chewing gums. The optimized MCG was loaded with 50% of either CUR or CUR/SBE-β-CD inclusion complex and tested in vitro for drug release. Although no differences in mechanical properties were observed, substituting CUR with the inclusion complex was found to significantly enhance drug release. This study highlighted the impact of each gum ingredient on the quality of the MCGs and demonstrated the feasibility of preparing chewing gums with up to 50% drug loading. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research on risk assessment at industrial sites has experienced growth during the end of this year. But in Indonesia, there is still limited research on risk assessment, especially regarding the importance of measuring non-carcinogenic risk assessment in the workplace. Benzene exposure is believed to reduce levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in workers.AIM: The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between risk quotient (RQ) of non-carcinogenic risk assessment of benzene and demographic factors on IgA levels.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects of the study were shoe craftsmen who were at risk of benzene exposure. The study design was cross-sectional with a total population of 20 workers. Measurement of IgA levels by Immunoturbidimetric Assay with a normal standard of 2-3 mg/ml. Calculation of non-carcinogenic (RQ) risk characteristics with a comparison between risk agent non-carcinogenic intake with RfD or RfC benzene.RESULTS: The majority of the study subjects aged over 45 years and had a working period of ≥ 25 years. There were 2 location points that had a threshold value exceeding the benzene standard (> 0.05 ppm), and 40% of the subjects had decreased IgA levels. Age and working periods had a significant relationship to IgA levels (p = 0.027; p = 0.047), while benzene and RQ levels did not have a significant relationship with IgA levels (p = 0.179; p = 0.436).CONCLUSION: Increasing age and working period can reduce IgA levels in the body. Further research is needed on risk assessment, especially on the safe limits of benzene concentration in the workplace to find out how long benzene exposure forms a non-carcinogenic or carcinogenic risk in workers' bodies exposed to benzene. © 2018 Abdul Rohim Tualeka, Juliana Jalaludin, Frans Salesman, Atjo Wahyu, Tukiran Tukiran, Sabar Setiawan, Dwi Ananto Wibrata, Herlina Novita Hasyim.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To analyze the infection status of human papilloma virus (HPV), Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in clinical patients. Methods The laboratory specimens including urine, urethral swabs, and cervical swabs from 870 patients from January 1st 2014 to December 31st 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. HPV-DNA was detected by multiplex fluorescent PCR, and the UU-RNA, CT-RNA, and NG-RNA were determined by isothermal nucleic acid amplification. The positive rate of each pathogen and the distribution of positive rate between male and female patients were calculated. The samples were further divided into HPV-positive group and HPV-negative group, and the positive rates of UU-RNA, CT-RNA, and NG-RNA in these two groups were compared. Results The highest positive rate was 53. 68% (467/870) for UU-RNA, followed by HPV-DNA [32. 41% (282/870)] and NG-RNA [2. 18% (19/870)]. The total positive rate of high-risk (HR) -HPV (subtypes; 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) [31.52% (209/663)] and UU in female patients [60.93% (404/663)] was significantly higher than that in male patients [17. 39% (36/207), 30. 34% (63/207)] (both P <0. 001). The male patients had significantly higher CT positive rate in HR-HPV-positive group than in HR-HPV-negative group [22. 58% (7/31) vs. 4.54% (8/176)] (P< 0.001). The female patients had significantly higher CT positive rate in HR-HPV-positive group than in HR-HPV-negative group [10.5% (21/200) vs. 5.61% (26/463)] (P =0.024). The UU-RNA positive rate of females in the low-risk (LR) -HPV (subtypes ; 6 and 11) positive group was significantly higher than that in LR-HPV negative group [70. 83 % (34/48) vs. 2. 11% (13/615)] (P <0. 001). Conclusions Women are more susceptible to HR-HPV and UU infections. HR-HPV-positive patients are more likely to experience CT infection. In contrast, co-infection with UU is more common in LR-HPV-positive females. © 2018 Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. All Rights Reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor with maximum surgical resection, radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) as the standard treatment. Diverse clinicopathological and molecular features are major obstacles to accurate predict survival and evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Reliable prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed for postoperative GBM patients. Methods: The protein coding genes (PCGs) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene expression profiles of 233 GBM postoperative patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), TANRIC and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We randomly divided the TCGA set into a training (n = 76) and a test set (n = 77) and used GSE7696 (n = 80) as an independent validation set. Survival analysis and the random survival forest algorithm were performed to screen survival associated signature. Results: Six PCGs (EIF2AK3, EPRS, GALE, GUCY2C, MTHFD2, RNF212) and five lncRNAs (CTD-2140B24.6, LINC02015, AC068888.1, CERNA1, LINC00618) were screened out by a risk score model and formed a PCG-lncRNA signature for its predictive power was strongest (AUC = 0.78 in the training dataset). The PCG-lncRNA signature could divide patients into high- risk or low-risk group with significantly different survival (median 7.47 vs. 18.27 months, log-rank test P < 0.001) in the training dataset. Similar result was observed in the test dataset (median 11.40 vs. 16.80 months, log-rank test P = 0.001) and the independent set (median 8.93 vs. 16.22 months, log-rank test P = 0.007). Multivariable Cox regression analysis verified that it was an independent prognostic factor for the postsurgical patients with GBM. Compared with IDH mutation status, O-(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status and age, the signature was proved to have a superior predictive power. And stratified analysis found that the signature could further separated postoperative GBM patients who received TMZ-chemoradiation into high- and low-risk groups in TCGA and GEO dataset. Conclusions: The PCG-lncRNA signature was a novel prognostic marker to predict survival and TMZ-chemoradiation response in GBM patients after surgery. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BH3 mimetics are promising drugs for hematologic malignancies that trigger cell death by promoting the release of proapoptotic BCL2 family members from antiapoptotic proteins. Multiple myeloma is considered to be a disease dependent mainly on MCL1 for survival, based mostly on studies using cell lines. We used a BH3-mimetic toolkit to study the dependency on BCL2, BCLXL, or MCL1 in malignant plasma cells from 60 patients. Dependencies were analyzed using an unbiased BH3 mimetics cell-death clustering by k-means. In the whole cohort of patients, BCL2 dependency was mostly found in the CCND1 subgroup (83%). Of note, MCL1 dependence significantly increased from 33% at diagnosis to 69% at relapse, suggesting a plasticity of the cellular dependency favoring MCL1 dependencies at relapse. In addition, 35% of overall patient samples showed codependencies on either BCL2/MCL1 or BCLXL/MCL1. Finally, we identified a group of patients not targeted by any of the BH3 mimetics, predominantly at diagnosis in patients not presenting the common recurrent translocations. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that BAK is crucial for cell death induced by MCL1 mimetic A1210477, according to the protection from cell death observed by BAK knock-down, as well as the complete and early disruption of MCL1/BAK complexes on A1210477 treatment. Interestingly, this complex was also dissociated in A1210477-resistant cells, but free BAK was simultaneously recaptured by BCLXL, supporting the role of BCLXL in A1210477 resistance. In conclusion, our study opens the way to rationally use venetoclax and/or MCL1 BH3 mimetics for clinical evaluation in myeloma at both diagnosis and relapse. © 2018 by The American Society of Hematology",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced carcinogenesis is a matter of huge popularity and the subject of in-depth research over the last few years. According to the literature, dopamine agonists and acetylsalicylic acid fall into the list of drugs likely to potentiate the development of cutaneous melanoma. However, according to recent data, widely used angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for the treatment of arterial hypertension, also carry a risk of malignancy development. The content of probable carcinogens, such as NDMA or NDEA in the drug valsartan (ARBs), causes the product to be withdrawn from the market. Recent experimental data suggest that another angiotensin receptor blocker-losartan also stimulates cell adhesion and melanoma cell invasion. CASE REPORT: We present a 70-year-old patient who has been on systemic therapy with a combined drug of amlodipine and valsartan since 2008 and only valsartan from 2015. Three years after the first intake of valsartan (2011), the patient developed a pigment lesion on the right arm. Approximately 2.5 years after doubling the dose of valsartan, the patient observed a progression in the size of the lesion, which was the cause of the dermatological examination and hospitalisation for surgical removal. The melanocytic lesion was removed by radical excision and a surgical field of 0.5 cm in all directions, followed by histological verification, which found the presence of cutaneous melanoma with a tumour thickness of 3 mm. A re-excision was planned with an additional surgical field of 1.5 cm in all directions combined with parallel removal of a draining lymph node. CONCLUSION: The case is indicative of two things: 1) the possible triggering of melanoma within the systemic treatment with valsartan; and 2) the necessity for optimization of melanoma surgery within the one-step melanoma surgery, which in this case would result in a single surgical excision of the primary lesion, with an operational security field of 2 cm in all directions, along with the removal of a draining lymph node. © 2018 Georgi Tchernev, Ivanka Temelkova.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has demonstrated proven efficacy in some hematologic cancers. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of LCAR-B38M, a dual epitope-binding CAR T cell therapy directed against 2 distinct B cell maturation antigen epitopes, in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: This ongoing phase 1, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study enrolled patients (18 to 80 years) with R/R MM. Lymphodepletion was performed using cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 . LCAR-B38M CAR T cells (median CAR+ T cells, 0.5 × 10 6 cells/kg [range, 0.07 to 2.1 × 10 6 ]) were infused in 3 separate infusions. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of LCAR-B38M CAR T cells; the secondary objective is to evaluate the antimyeloma response of the treatment based on the general guidelines of the International Myeloma Working Group. Results: At data cutoff, 57 patients had received LCAR-B38M CAR T cells. All patients experienced ≥ 1 adverse events (AEs). Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported in 37/57 patients (65%); most common were leukopenia (17/57; 30%), thrombocytopenia (13/57; 23%), and aspartate aminotransferase increased (12/57; 21%). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 51/57 patients (90%); 4/57 (7%) had grade ≥ 3 cases. One patient reported neurotoxicity of grade 1 aphasia, agitation, and seizure-like activity. The overall response rate was 88% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76 to 95); 39/57 patients (68%) achieved a complete response, 3/57 (5%) achieved a very good partial response, and 8/57 (14%) achieved a partial response. Minimal residual disease was negative for 36/57 (63%) patients. The median time to response was 1 month (range, 0.4 to 3.5). At a median follow-up of 8 months, median progression-free survival was 15 months (95% CI, 11 to not estimable). Median overall survival for all patients was not reached. Conclusions: LCAR-B38M CAR T cell therapy displayed a manageable safety profile and demonstrated deep and durable responses in patients with R/R MM. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the features characterising cutaneous SCC as high-risk is lymphovascular infiltration. The diffuse lymphangitic spread of carcinogenic cells is defined as the so-called lymphangitis carcinomatosa. In some cases, it is the only and first sign to alert the presence of an underlying malignancy. Therefore, biopsy in patients with clinical data on lymphangiosis carcinomatosa is of paramount importance.CASE REPORT: We present a 77-year-old man with a progressively growing tumour formation in the area of the right shoulder, clinically suspected for SCC. During the dermatological examination, it was found that the lesion was surrounded by an infiltrated, perilesional relief shaft, which was histologically verified as lymphangitis carcinomatosa. The tumour formation was removed by radical excision and formation of a large skin-subcutaneous defect. To correct the surgical defect, a cervico-pectoral flap was performed, followed by tunnel transposition of the scapular graft through the deltoid muscle. The preoperative, ultrasound-marked artery was the arteria circumflexa scapulae dextra, which was used as the foot of the scapular graft and at the same time ensuring its blood supply. After the performed surgical flaps there remains a small uncovered surgical defect, which was left for subsequent secondary healing or full thickness mesh graft. The subsequent histological examination of the removed tumour formation detected the presence of squamous cell carcinoma.CONCLUSION: Patients with the simultaneous presence of two different pathological cutaneous changes, located in the immediate proximity often require a multidisciplinary and complex treatment approach. For tumour formations close to the area of the neck, the cervical-pectoral flap provides optimal cosmetic recovery of the surgical defect. The tunnel transposition is an individualised, unconventional and difficult to implement the approach, which however showed a good therapeutic result. On the other hand, the preoperative histological examination of reddish peritumoral localised tentacles leads to 1) diagnosis of lymphangiosis carcinomatosa as well as 2) the subsequent precise determination of the limits of surgical excision, which is a large number of cases saves the need for secondary re-excision in these patients. © 2018 Georgi Tchernev, Ilia Lozev, Ivan Pidakev, Ivanka Temelkova.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previously, we have demonstrated that Interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2) is overexpressed in approximate 78% Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples. We have also demonstrated that IL-13Rα2 can serve as a target for cancer immunotherapy in several pre-clinical and clinical studies. However, the significance of overexpression of IL-13Rα2 in GBM and astrocytoma and signaling through these receptors is not known. IL-13 can signal through IL-13R via JAK/STAT and AP-1 pathways in certain cell lines including some tumor cell lines. Herein, we have investigated a role of IL-13/IL-13Rα2 axis in signaling through AP-1 transcription factors in human glioma samples in situ. Methods: We examined the activation of AP-1 family of transcription factors (c-Jun, Fra-1, Jun-D, c-Fos, and Jun-B) after treating U251, A172 (IL-13Rα2 +ve) and T98G (IL-13Rα2 -ve) glioma cell lines with IL-13 by RT-qPCR, and immunocytochemistry (ICC). We also performed colorimetric ELISA based assay to determine AP-1 transcription factor activation in glioma cell lines. Furthermore, we examined the expression of AP-1 transcription factors in situ in GBM and astrocytoma specimens by multiplex-immunohistochemistry (IHC). Student t test and ANOVA were used for statistical analysis of the results. Results: We have demonstrated up-regulation of two AP-1 transcription factors (c-Jun and Fra-1) at mRNA and protein levels upon treatment with IL-13 in IL-13Rα2 positive but not in IL-13Rα2 negative glioma cell lines. Both transcription factors were also overexpressed in patient derived GBM specimens, however, in contrast to GBM cell lines, c-Fos is also overexpressed in patient derived specimens. Astrocytoma specimens showed lesser extent of immunostaining for IL-13Rα2 and three AP-1 factors compared to GBM specimens. By transcription factor activation assay, we demonstrated that AP-1 transcription factors (C-Jun and Fra-1) were activated upon treatment of IL-13Rα2 + GBM cell lines but not IL-13Rα2 - GBM cell line with IL-13. Our results demonstrate functional activity of AP-1 transcription factor in GBM cell lines in response to IL-13. Conclusions: These results indicate that IL-13/IL-13Rα2 axis can mediate signal transduction in situ via AP-1 pathway in GBM and astrocytoma and may serve as a new target for GBM immunotherapy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "miRNAs are potent molecular regulators of cellular behaviour. The manipulation of these small non-coding RNAs has been used to enhance industrially relevant phenotypes in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. We investigated the stable depletion of six miRNAs; miR-204-5p, 338-3p, 378-3p, 409-3p, 455-3p and 505-3p, robustly associated with cell growth rate from a previous profiling study. Inhibition of endogenous miR-378-3p function by miRNA-sponge-decoy improved peak cell density by 59%. Quantitative label free LC–MS/MS proteomic analysis of the fractionated cell cultures at day 4 and 8 of batch culture found 216 cytosolic and 114 membrane-associated proteins differentially expressed with stable miR-378-3p depletion. qRT-PCR of 8 genes; Clic4, Hnrnpa1, Prdx1, Actn4, Usp14, Srxn1, Canx and Gnb1, with unidirectional differential protein expression over the two time points of analysis was carried out. In-silico predictive algorithms; TargetScan and miRDB, were used to decipher possible direct targets of miR-378-3p. The Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14 (Usp14) protein was identified in the cytosolic fractions at both timepoints as differentially expressed with an increased abundance of 1.58-fold in the miR-378-3p depleted cells on day 8. Usp14 is a deubiquitinase (DUB) with previous reports of its up-regulation leading to increased proliferation of cancer cells. Overexpression of Usp14 in CHO cells had significant effects on cell growth supporting a role for Usp14 in the increased peak cell density seen with miR-378-3p depletion. This study highlights miR-378-3p as a novel engineering candidate for improving CHO cell growth. The use of subcellular fractionation also improved proteome coverage in the identification of novel miRNA targets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: CXC chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) is frequently overexpressed in a variety of tumors. Nevertheless, whether CXCR7 can be used as a tumor prognosis marker has not been systematically assessed. The current meta-analysis was performed to obtain an accurate evaluation of the relationship between CXCR7 level and the prognosis of cancer patients. Methods: Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed were systematically searched according to a defined search strategy up to June 11, 2018. Then, the required data were extracted from all qualified studies which were screened out based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, the hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of CXCR7 in tumor patients. Results: A total of 28 original research studies comprising 33 cohorts and 5685 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that CXCR7 overexpression was significantly related to worse overall survival (OS) (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.49-1.99), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 5.58; 95% CI 3.16-9.85), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.66-4.85) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.34-1.88) in cancer patients. Furthermore, for certain types of cancer, significant associations between higher CXCR7 expression and worse OS of glioma (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.43-2.19), breast cancer (HR 1.45; 95% CI 1.28-1.63), esophageal cancer (HR 2.72; 95% CI 1.11-6.66) and pancreatic cancer (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.12-1.90) were found. However, for lung cancer and hepatocellular cancer, there was no significant relationship between CXCR7 expression level and OS, (HR 2.40; 95% CI 0.34-17.07) and (HR 1.37; 95% CI 0.84-2.24) respectively. Conclusions: Increased CXCR7 level could predict poor prognosis of tumor patients and might be regarded as a novel prognostic biomarker for tumor patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Plasma is the fourth state of matter with higher energy than gas; non-thermal plasma (NTP) is currently available. As NTP is useful in sterilization, promoting wound healing and cancer treatments, the molecular mechanisms of plasma-induced effects in living cells and microorganisms are of significant interest in plasma medicine with medical-engineering collaboration. Molecular mechanisms of plasma-induced effects in cancer cells will be described in this minireview. Both direct and indirect methods to treat cancer cells with NTP have been developed. NTP interacts directly with not only cancer cells but also the liquids surrounding cancer cells and the immune cells that target them. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species play key roles in NTP-induced effects; however, other mechanisms have been suggested. The complex interactions between NTP, cells and liquids have been extensively studied. In the future, details regarding NTP-induced effects on gene regulatory networks, signaling networks, and metabolic networks will be elucidated. © Walter de Gruyter GmbH.",

    "Abstract": "Plasma oncology is a relatively new field of research. Recent developments have indicated that cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) technology is an interesting new therapeutic approach to cancer treatment. In this study, p53 wildtype (LoVo) and human p53 mutated (HT29 and SW480) colorectal cancer cells were treated with the miniFlatPlaSter - a device particularly developed for the treatment of tumor cells - that uses the Surface Micro Discharge (SMD) technology for plasma production in air. The present study analyzed the effects of plasma on colorectal cancer cells in vitro and on normal colon tissue ex vivo. Plasma treatment had strong effects on colon cancer cells, such as inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell death and modulation of p21 expression. In contrast, CAP treatment of murine colon tissue ex vivo for up to 2 min did not show any toxic effect on normal colon cells compared to H2O2 positive control. In summary, these results suggest that the miniFlatPlaSter plasma device is able to kill colorectal cancer cells independent of their p53 mutation status. Thus, this device presents a promising new approach in colon cancer therapy. © Walter de Gruyter GmbH.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Disparities in cancer outcomes amongst Indigenous Australians reflect a pattern of reduced access to and engagement with health services. A growing emphasis on patient-centred care has increased efforts to measure patient experiences, but it is unclear whether existing approaches: a) assess the most critical aspects of care that shape the experiences of Indigenous people with cancer; and b) facilitate the engagement and participation of Indigenous people with the measurement of care experiences. Methods: Two rounds of semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used to elicit stakeholders' views on priorities for measuring the cancer care experiences of Indigenous cancer patients and on the acceptability of various methods for capturing such information. Participants included Indigenous people affected by cancer (n = 17), health professionals (n = 28) and individuals in both groups (n = 7). Recruitment occurred through a national web-based network and through four cancer services in urban and regional areas in three jurisdictions across Australia. Results: Several aspects of cancer care were identified as critical in shaping Indigenous patients' experiences. Key themes included: feeling safe in the system; importance of Indigenous staff; barriers to care; the role of family and friends; effective communication and education; and coordination of care and transition between services. Those participants affected by carers' wellbeing and palliative care strongly advocated for the importance of these topics. Participants expressed support for a face-to-face interview with a trusted person as the most appropriate means of collecting cancer care experience information. Conclusions: While existing experience measurement tools would partially capture some important aspects of care, other critical areas would likely be missed. Appropriate tools and approaches, developed by and with Indigenous people, are urgently needed to determine the extent to which health services are meeting the needs of Indigenous people with cancer, and to identify areas for action to improve these services. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Studies regarding complex breast cancer aetiology are limited and the results are inconclusive. We investigated the associations between dietary patterns (DPs), metabolic-hormone profiles (M-HPs), and breast cancer risk. This case-control study involved 420 women aged 40–79 years from north-eastern Poland, including 190 newly-diagnosed breast cancer cases. The serum concentration of lipid components, glucose, and hormones (oestradiol, progesterone, testosterone, prolactin, cortisol, insulin) was marked in 129 post-menopausal women (82 controls, 47 cases). The food frequency consumption was collected using a validated 62-item food frequency questionnaire. A posteriori DPs or M-HPs were derived with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Three DPs: ‘Non-Healthy’, ‘Prudent’, and ‘Margarine and Sweetened Dairy’ and two M-HPs: ‘Metabolic-Syndrome’ and ‘High-Hormone’ were identified. The ‘Polish-adapted Mediterranean Diet’ (‘Polish-aMED’) score was calculated. The risk of breast cancer risk was three-times higher (odds ratio (OR): 2.90; 95% confidence interval (95% Cl): 1.62–5.21; p < 0.001) in the upper tertile of the ‘Non-Healthy’ pattern (reference: bottom tertile) and five-times higher (OR: 5.34; 95% Cl: 1.84–15.48; p < 0.01) in the upper tertile of the ‘High-Hormone’ profile (reference: bottom tertile). There was a positive association of ‘Metabolic-Syndrome’ profile and an inverse association of ‘Polish-aMED’ score with the risk of breast cancer, which disappeared after adjustment for confounders. No significant association between ‘Prudent’ or ‘Margarine and Sweetened Dairy’ DPs and cancer risk was revealed. Concluding, a pro-healthy diet is insufficient to reduce the risk of breast cancer in peri-and postmenopausal women. The findings highlight the harmful effect of the ‘High-Hormone’ profile and the ‘Non-Healthy’ dietary pattern on breast cancer risk. In breast cancer prevention, special attention should be paid to decreasing the adherence to the ‘Non-Healthy’ pattern by reducing the consumption of highly processed food and foods with a high content of sugar and animal fat. There is also a need to monitor the concentration of multiple sex hormones in the context of breast cancer risk. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Few epidemiologic findings are as well established as the association between smoking and lung cancer. It is therefore somewhat surprising that there is not yet a clear consensus about the exposure-response relationships between various metrics of smoking and lung cancer risk. In part this is due to heterogeneity of how exposure-response results have been presented and the relative paucity of published results using any particular metric of exposure. The purposes of this study are: to provide new data on smoking-lung cancer associations and to explore the relative impact of different dimensions of smoking history on lung cancer risk. Methods: Based on a large lung cancer case-control study (1203 cases and 1513 controls) conducted in Montreal in 1996-2000, we estimated the lifetime prevalence of smoking and odds ratios in relation to several smoking metrics, both categorical and continuous based on multivariable unconditional logistic regression. Results: Odds ratios (ORs) for ever vs never smoking were 7.82 among males and 11.76 among females. ORs increased sharply with every metric of smoking examined, more so for duration than for daily intensity. In models using continuous smoking variables, all metrics had strong effects on OR and mutual adjustment among smoking metrics did not noticeably attenuate the OR estimates, indicating that each metric carries some independent risk-related information. Among all the models tested, the one based on a smoking index that integrates several smoking dimensions, provided the best fitting model. Similar patterns were observed for the different histologic types of lung cancer. Conclusions: This study provides many estimates of exposure-response relationships between smoking and lung cancer; these can be used in future meta-analyses. Irrespective of the histologic type of lung cancer and the smoking metric examined, high levels of smoking led to high levels of risk, for both men and women. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A hysteresis loop analysis (HLA) method for breast cancer diagnosis based on a non-invasive digital imaging elasto-tomography (DIET) screening system is evaluated using data from 3 clinical trial patients, comprising 2 healthy breasts and 4 breasts with cancer. The identified mechanical nominal stiffness with ∼2x higher values compared to healthy tissue stiffness localized the correct cancerous area (CA) or tumor location, matching the mammography detection for all 4 breasts with cancer. The difference in identified stiffness varies across different frequencies and individuals. However, the identified stiffness for all healthy breasts and/or health tissue regions are consistent across frequencies, avoiding false positive diagnosis. The overall approach can be implemented automatically without requiring a skilled operator, thus reducing the screening cost. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks the second in mortality rate among all cancers. Metastases account for most of the deaths in GC patients. Yet our understanding of GC and its metastasis mechanism is still very limited. Methods: We performed 20 whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 5 typical metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) patients with lymph node metastasis. We compared both the primary tumors to their metastatic lymph nodes, and a specific analysis pipeline was used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variants (CNVs). Results: (1) We confirmed 30 candidate mutations in both primary and lymph nodes tissues, and other 7 only in primary tumors. (2) Copy number gains were observed in a large section of 17q12-21, as well as copy number losses in regions containing CDKN2A and CDKN2B in both primary and lymph nodes tissues. Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary insights in the molecular mechanisms of GC initiation, development, and metastatic progression. These results need to be validated through large-scale studies. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Negative feelings, such as anxiety and depression, are common in patients with cancer. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition and distress in cancer patients and to examine the relationship between them. Materials and methods: We did a cross-sectional study in West China hospital, China, using adapted questionnaires derived from Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS2002) and Distress Thermometer (DT). We also focused on the factors associated with distress. Results: We found that psychological distress in cancer patients was common, with 39.5% patients suffering from distress. The mean score of PG-SGA was 3.37 (0-6), and 39.1% patients had malnutrition when using 4 as a cut-off value. Meanwhile, the mean score of NRS2002 was 1.91 (0-11), and 25.8% patients presented with malnutrition when using 3 as the cut-off value. Higher scores of nutritional risks confirmed by PG-SGA (r = 0.148, p < 0.001) and NRS2002 (r = 0.142, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with higher levels of psychological stress. Conclusion: Malnutrition was correlated with psychological stress in cancer patients. Early intervention in the mental problems and nutrition was meaningful, which could improve the psychological statuses of cancer patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticle-based drug delivery allows effective and sustained delivery of therapeutic agents to solid tumors and has completely changed how cancer is treated. As a new technology for medical applications, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) shows a great potential in selective cancer treatment. The aim of this work is to develop a new dual cancer treatment approach by integrating CAP with novel paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded nanoparticles for targeting A549 cells. For this purpose, PTX-loaded core-shell magnetic nanoparticles were prepared through coaxial electrospraying, and various characteristics were investigated. Biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) was selected as the polymer shell to encapsulate the anticancer therapeutics. Results demonstrated a uniform size distribution and high drug encapsulation efficiency of the electrosprayed nanoparticles, which had sustained release characteristics and a variety of excellent properties. An in vitro study showed that PTX-loaded nanoparticles and CAP synergistically inhibited the growth of A549 cells more effectively than when each was used individually. We also found that CAP could induce the PTX-loaded nanoparticles in tumor cells to increase the effective drug concentration to a level that might be conducive to reduce drug resistance. Therefore, the integration of PTX-encapsulated nanoparticles and CAP provides a promising tool for the development of a new non-small cell lung cancer treatment strategy. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Characterization of the tumor microenvironment, including extracellular vesicles (EVs), is important for understanding cancer progression. EV studies have traditionally been performed on dissociated cells, lacking spatial information. Since the distribution of EVs in the tumor microenvironment is associated with cellular function, there is a strong need for visualizing EVs in freshly resected tissues. We intraoperatively imaged untreated human breast tissues using a custom nonlinear imaging system. Label-free optical contrasts of the tissue, correlated with histological findings, enabled point-of-procedure characterization of the tumor microenvironment. EV densities from 29 patients with breast cancer were found to increase with higher histologic grade and shorter tumor-to-margin distance and were significantly higher than those from 7 cancer-free patients undergoing breast reduction surgery. Acquisition and interpretation of these intraoperative images not only provide real-time visualization of the tumor microenvironment but also offer the potential to use EVs as a label-free biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women affecting one out of eight females throughout their lives. Autotaxin (ATX) is upregulated in breast cancer which results in increased lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) formation within the tumor. This study's aim was to identify the role of different mammary cell populations within the ATX-LPA axis. Methods: Epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule-positive (EpCAM) and -negative cells from breast tumors, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) of tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant mammary fat were isolated and compared to healthy ADSCs, mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), and mesenchymal cells (MES) of healthy mammary tissue (n = 4 each) and further to well-established breast (cancer) cell lines. Results: mRNA expression analyses revealed that ADSCs and MES largely expressed LPA receptor 1 (LPAR1) while epithelial cells mainly expressed LPAR6. LPA 18:1 activated all the cell populations and cell lines by rise in cytosolic free calcium concentrations. MES and ADSCs expressed ATX whereas epithelial cells did not. ADSCs revealed the highest expression in ATX with a significant decline after adipogenic differentiation in healthy ADSCs, whereas ATX expression increased in ADSCs from tumor patients. Breast (cancer) cell lines did not express ATX. Transmigration of MES was stimulated by LPA whereas an inhibitory effect was observed in epithelial cells with no differences between tumors and healthy cells. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines were also stimulated and the transmigration partly inhibited using the LPA receptor antagonist Ki16425. Conclusions: We here show that each mammary cell population plays a different role in the ATX-LPA axis with ADSCs and adipocytes being the main source of ATX in tumor patients in our experimental setting. Inhibitors of this axis may therefore present a valuable target for pharmacological therapies. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-4) chemotherapy in terms of the response rate, progression-free/overall survival (PFS/OS) and safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: Clinical data were reviewed in 29 patients who received FOLFOX-4 as more than third-line chemotherapy, consisting of 85 mg/m 2 of oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m 2 of leucovorin, and bolus 400 mg/m 2 on day 1 of 5-fluorouracil, followed by a 22-h infusion of 600 mg/m 2 of 5-fluorouracil for 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks. We also compared the efficacy and toxicity of FOLFOX-4 with that of topotecan, a standard treatment, given at a dosage of 1.5 mg/m 2 every three weeks in 26 patients. Results: The median age of enrolled patients was 60 years (range 33 to 85). A median of 4 cycles (range 1-17) of FOLFOX-4 were administered. Complete response and partial response were observed in one (3.5%) and 5 (17.2.2%) patients, respectively, while stable disease was reported in 8 (27.6%) patients. Among all patients, grade 3-4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in 0 (0%), 5 (17.2%), and 3 (10.3%) cases, respectively. Grade 3-4 fatigue was recorded in one (3.4%) patient and diarrhea in 2 (6.9%). Median PFS and OS were 2.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-4.9] and 6.2 months (95% CI 2.4-14.6), respectively. No significant differences in terms of efficacy and toxicity were observed between patients receiving FOLFOX-4 and those treated with topotecan. Conclusions: The FOLFOX-4 regimen would seem to obtain similar survival rates to those of standard therapy with topotecan in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

    "Abstract": "Background: We previously demonstrated that knockdown of delta-5-desaturase via siRNA transfection together with dihomo-γ-linolenic acid supplementation inhibited colon cancer cell growth and migration, by promoting the production of the anti-cancer byproduct 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid from Cyclooxygenase-2-catalyzed dihomo-γ-linolenic acid peroxidation. Here, we extend our study to investigate the effects of delta-5-desaturase-knockdown and the resulting intensified dihomo-γ-linolenic acid peroxidation in xenograft tumor mice model. Methods: Four-week old nude mice bearing the human colon cancer cell HCA-7/C29 vs. its delta-5-desaturase knockdown analog (via shRNA transfection) were subject to 4-week treatments of: vehicle control, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid supplementation, 5-Fluorouracil, and combination of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid and 5-Fluorouracil. Tumor growth was monitored during the treatment. At the endpoint, the mice were euthanized and the tumor tissues were collected for further mechanism analysis. Results: Delta-5-desaturase knockdown (shRNA) together with dihomo-γ-linolenic acid supplementation increased 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid production to a threshold level in xenograft tumors, which consequently induced p53-dependent apoptosis and reduced tumors significantly. The promoted 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid formation was also found to suppress the tumors' metastatic potential via regulating MMP-2 and E-cadherin expressions. In addition, our in vivo data showed that delta-5-desaturase knockdown along with dihomo-γ-linolenic acid supplementation resulted in anti-tumor effects comparable to those of 5-Fluorouracil. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that our paradigm-shifting strategy of knocking down delta-5-desaturase and taking advantage of overexpressed Cyclooxygenase-2 in tumor cells can be used for colon cancer suppression. Our research outcome will lead us to develop a better and safer anti-cancer therapy for patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) play instrumental roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune modulation, metastasis, and drug resistance. TEX RNAs are a new class of noninvasive biomarkers for cancer. Neither current techniques, such as quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and next-generation sequencing, nor new ones, such as electrochemical or surface plasmon resonance-based biosensors, are able to selectively capture and separate TEXs from normal cell-derived exosomes, making TEX RNAs potentially less sensitive biomarkers. We developed an immuno-biochip that selectively captures TEXs using antibodies against tumor-associated proteins and quantifies in situ TEX RNAs using cationic lipoplexes containing molecular beacons. We used the immuno-biochip to measure the expression of miR-21 microRNA and TTF-1 mRNA in EGFR- or PD-L1-bearing exosomes from human sera and achieved absolute sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing normal controls from non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our results demonstrated that the effective separation of TEXs from other exosomes greatly improved the detection sensitivity and specificity. Compared with the traditional immunomagnetic separation-RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow, the immuno-biochip showed superior lung cancer diagnostic performance, consumed less samples (∼30 μL), and shortened assay time from ∼24 to 4 h.

    "Abstract": "Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood is of paramount significance for cancer diagnosis, progress evaluation, and individualized therapy. However, the rareness and heterogeneity of CTCs introduces significant challenges in the capture of cancer cells as well as downstream genetic analysis. In this work, a microwell-assisted multiaptamer immunomagnetic platform (MMAIP) is proposed for highly efficient capture of CTCs with minimum influence of heterogeneity. Assisted by a microwell chip, the purity of CTCs is greatly improved, thus meeting the requirement of downstream gene analysis. This is, as far as is known, the first aptamer based platform enabling mutation analysis of the captured CTCs from cancer patients, which will contribute to the practical application of aptamers in clinics. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "The accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is effective and well known. However, how to maximize accumulation is still a bottleneck in the development of nanomedicine. Herein, a tumor vascular-targeted hybrid polymeric micelle, which has a great capacity to selectively augment the EPR effect of nanoparticles by dilating tumor blood vessels via the activity of nitric oxide (NO), is presented. Under neutral conditions, the micelle is stable, with a long blood circulation half-life due to the carboxylated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer; in mildly acidic tumor tissues, the micelle can selectively target the tumor blood vessels by the exposed cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide (cRGD) peptides, which is realized with a pH-dependent hydrolysis of the monomethoxy PEG layer. Simultaneously, exposed copper ions catalyze the decomposition of endogenous NO donors, which generates NO in situ, leading to vasodilation and increased tumor vascular permeability. As a result, the accumulation of nanoparticles is significantly enhanced, and a high accumulation of doxorubicin in tumors is achieved at 48 h after injection. This high dose of therapeutic agent produces a large inhibition of tumor growth (94%) in cancer treatment, and shows no general toxicity, with 100% of the mice surviving the treatment regimen. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Prompt and repeated assessments of tumor sensitivity to available therapeutics could reduce patient morbidity and mortality by quickly identifying therapeutic resistance and optimizing treatment regimens. Analysis of changes in cancer cell biomass has shown promise in assessing drug sensitivity and fulfilling these requirements. However, a major limitation of previous studies in solid tumors, which comprise 90% of cancers, is the use of cancer cell lines rather than freshly isolated tumor material. As a result, existing biomass protocols are not obviously extensible to real patient tumors owing to potential artifacts that would be generated by the removal of cells from their microenvironment and the deleterious effects of excision and purification. In this present work, we show that simple excision of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors growing in immunodeficient mouse, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, followed by enzymatic disaggregation into single cell suspension, is enabling for rapid and accurate biomass accumulation-based predictions of in vivo sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug carboplatin. We successfully correlate in vitro biomass results with in vivo treatment results in three TNBC PDX models that have differential sensitivity to this drug. With a maximum turnaround time of 40 h from tumor excision to useable results and a fully-automated analysis pipeline, the assay described here has significant potential for translation to clinical practice. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Early relapse in colorectal cancer (CRC) after curative resection is mainly attributed to the key determinants such as tumor histology, stage, lymphovascular invasion, and the response to chemotherapy. Interindividual variability in the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy between patients receiving the same treatment may be ascribed to the patients' genetic profile. In this report, we highlight a clinical case of a patient with stage II CRC who relapsed within a short period after starting adjuvant chemotherapy and was later found to have multiple genetic polymorphisms in the DPYD, TYMS, MTHFR, and DHFR genes. Based on the clinical data of the patient and the key role of these genes in 5-fluorouracil pathway, we hypothesize that these variants may contribute to the drug response and early relapse in CRC. © 2018 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

    "Abstract": "Compared with other subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is seriously threatening to human life. Therefore, it is a matter of urgency to develop multifunctional nanoprobes for visualized theranostics of TNBC, achieving specific targeting toward only TNBC, but not other subtypes. Nanoscale metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) show important potential in visualized theranostics of tumors, but it is critical to synthesize well-defined core–shell MOF-based nanocomposites by encapsulating a single nanoparticle within MOF. In this study, a TNBC-targeted peptide (ZD2)-engineered, and a single gold nanostar (AuNS) coated within MIL-101-NH 2 (Fe) by coating MOF with four cycles, obtain well-defined core–shell AuNS@MOF-ZD2 nanocomposites, which are expected to achieve T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) specifically targeting toward TNBC. The prepared AuNS@MOF-ZD2 nanocomposites possess good biocompatibility, efficient T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) relaxivity and stable photothermal conversion ability with an efficiency of 40.5%. The in vitro and in vivo characterizations prove their performances of T 1 -weighted MR and PTT with a low power density of 808 nm laser, achieving excellent theranostic efficacy in TNBC. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the prepared AuNS@MOF-ZD2 nanoprobes can specifically target TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231), but not other subtypes of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7), indicating their promising application in visualized theranostics of breast cancers with molecular classification. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: Over the last 40 years, there has been a significant increase in the incidence of testicular cancer. The epidemiologic evidence to understand this phenomenon is unclear, however exogenous estrogen exposure is thought to be a driver in the development of testicular cancer. This is of particular importance in the transgender population because utilization of exogenous estrogen therapy is an essential aspect of the transition process. Case: We present the case of a 38-year-old Caucasian male to female transgender patient who presented with metastatic testicular cancer 15 months after initiating estrogen therapy. She presented to our emergency department with worsening back pain and fatigue. A clinical examination revealed a right-sided testicular mass. A computed tomography scan of her abdomen/pelvis identified a right groin lesion measuring 6.4 cm, a retroperitoneal mass causing right-sided hydronephrosis, an extensive deep vein thrombosis, and pathologic abdominal lymphadenopathy. Germ cell tumor markers revealed an alpha-fetoprotein of < 2.5 μg/L and a beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin of 2526 IU/L. Her lactate dehydrogenase was 5294 U/L. Medical oncology advised the discontinuation of hormonal therapy at this time. On the basis of elevation in germ cell tumor markers and the burden of disease, she was treated with four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin chemotherapy. A decision to defer upfront radical inguinal orchiectomy was made due to not wanting to have an early interruption in anticoagulation. Following the completion of the chemotherapy, a 6 cm retroperitoneal mass persisted. Due to the location of the mass and surgical morbidity associated with excision, she was followed with positron emission tomography-computed tomography by Uro-oncology, with no evidence of recurrent disease 2 years since the time of diagnosis. Conclusions: While there are recognized risks associated with estrogen therapy less is known about the extent to which exogenous estrogen can serve as a driver of malignancy. With recent experimental evidence revealing a pro-growth impact of estrogen on human testicular cells, continued reporting of similar cases in the literature is imperative to see if a link between exogenous estrogen exposure and testicular cancer exists. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Studies of drug resistance mostly characterize genetic mutation, and we know much less about phenotypic mechanisms of drug resistance, especially at a quantitative level. p53 is an important mediator of cellular response to chemotherapy, but even p53 wild-type cells vary in drug sensitivity for unclear reasons. Here, we elucidated a new resistance mechanism to a DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic through bimodal modulation of p53 activation dynamics. By combining single-cell imaging with computational modeling, we characterized a four-component regulatory module, which generates bimodal p53 dynamics through coupled feed-forward and feedback, and found that the inhibitory strength between ATM and Mdm2 determined the differential modular output between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cell lines. We further showed that the combinatorial inhibition of Mdm2 and Wip1 was an effective strategy to alter p53 dynamics in resistant cancer cells and sensitize their apoptotic response. Our results point to p53 pulsing as a potentially druggable mechanism that mediates chemoresistance. Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved;",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer surgeons struggle with differentiating healthy tissue from cancer at the resection margin during surgery. We report on the feasibility of using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) for real-time in vivo tissue characterization. Methods: Evaluating feasibility of the technology requires a setting in which measurements, imaging and pathology have the best possible correlation. For this purpose an optical biopsy needle was used that had integrated optical fibers at the tip of the needle. This approach enabled the best possible correlation between optical measurement volume and tissue histology. With this optical biopsy needle we acquired real-time DRS data of normal tissue and tumor tissue in 27 patients that underwent an ultrasound guided breast biopsy procedure. Five additional patients were measured in continuous mode in which we obtained DRS measurements along the entire biopsy needle trajectory. We developed and compared three different support vector machine based classification models to classify the DRS measurements. Results: With DRS malignant tissue could be discriminated from healthy tissue. The classification model that was based on eight selected wavelengths had the highest accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.93 and 0.87, respectively. In three patients that were measured in continuous mode and had malignant tissue in their biopsy specimen, a clear transition was seen in the classified DRS measurements going from healthy tissue to tumor tissue. This transition was not seen in the other two continuously measured patients that had benign tissue in their biopsy specimen. Conclusions: It was concluded that DRS is feasible for integration in a surgical tool that could assist the breast surgeon in detecting positive resection margins during breast surgery.

    "Abstract": "The mitochondria have emerged as a novel target for cancer chemotherapy primarily due to their central roles in energy metabolism and apoptosis regulation. Here, we report a new molecular approach to achieve high levels of tumor- and mitochondria-selective deliveries of the anticancer drug doxorubicin. This is achieved by molecular engineering, which functionalizes doxorubicin with a hydrophobic lipid tail conjugated by a solubility-promoting poly(ethylene glycol) polymer (amphiphilic doxorubicin or amph-DOX). In vivo, the amphiphile conjugated to doxorubicin exhibits a dual function: (i) it binds avidly to serum albumin and hijacks albumin's circulating and transporting pathways, resulting in prolonged circulation in blood, increased accumulation in tumor, and reduced exposure to the heart; (ii) it also redirects doxorubicin to mitochondria by altering the drug molecule's intracellular sorting and transportation routes. Efficient mitochondrial targeting with amph-DOX causes a significant increase of reactive oxygen species levels in tumor cells, resulting in markedly improved antitumor efficacy than the unmodified doxorubicin. Amphiphilic modification provides a simple strategy to simultaneously increase the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin in cancer chemotherapy. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, intelligent polymeric micelles with multifunctions are in urgent demand for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Herein, pH and redox dual-responsive prodrug micelles with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active cellular imaging and charge conversion have been prepared for combined chemotherapy and bioimaging based on a novel doxorubicin-conjugated amphiphilic PMPC-PAEMA-P (TPE-co-HD)-ss-P (TPE-co-HD)-PAEMA-PMPC copolymer. The doxorubicin is conjugated via a pH cleavable imine linkage and can be packed in the hydrophobic core along with the glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide bond. The DOX-conjugated inner core is sealed with a pH-responsive PAEMA as the \"gate\", which would rapidly open in the acidic condition, following the drug release and charge conversion-mediated acceleration of endocytosis. After an efficient internalization, the disulfide bond can be cleaved by the high concentration of GSH causing the further accelerated drug release. Meanwhile, intracellular drug delivery can be traced due to the AIE behavior of micelles. Moreover, great tumor inhibition in vitro and in vivo has been demonstrated for these DOX-conjugated micelles. This smart prodrug micelle system would be a desirable drug carrier for cancer therapy and bioimaging. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we presented ternary nanoparticles [poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA)(peptide dendrimer-modified carbon dots (CD-D)/doxorubicin (DOX))] based on peptide dendritic carbon dots (CDs) to realize tumor-specific drug delivery and highly efficient cancer therapy. The versatile nanoparticles could achieve \"stealth\" delivery in blood due to the antifouling zwitterion coating. Meanwhile, charge changes of the zwitterions could be moderated during their transportation toward/inside tumor cells, where subtle environmental pH variations acted as potent stimuli to actualize desired functions. In particular, the detachment of the zwitterionic \"coat\" at the tumor site resulted in the exposure of abundant peripheral guanidine groups on peptide dendritic carbon dots (CD-D/DOX) owing to the extracellular pH environment (pH 6.8)-induced charge conversion. Consequently, the positively charged CD-D/DOX (+7.02 mV) interacted with the negatively charged cancer cell membrane to enhance cellular uptake. After endocytosis, tumor intracellular microenvironments (acidic conditions and high glutathione (GSH) levels) could lead to effective disintegration of the CD-D/DOX entities due to acid-induced protonation of guanidine groups and glutathione-induced cleavage of peptide dendritic components on CDs, and then effective endosomal escape and fast doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX·HCl) release (73.2% accumulative release within 4 h) were achieved successively. This strategy enabled a 9.19-fold drug release rate at tumor sites in comparison with the one in the physiological environment. Moreover, the excellent fluorescence properties of CDs endowed the pCBMA(CD-D/DOX) with fluorescence bioimaging function. In view of the above-mentioned advantages, pCBMA(CD-D/DOX) exhibited outstanding antitumor activities both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating much higher antitumor efficacy and less side effects than the free DOX·HCl. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "In-stent restenosis caused by tumor ingrowth is a major problem for patients undergoing stent placement because conventional stents often lack sustainable antitumor capabilities. The aim of this work is to develop a silk fibroin (SF)-based nanofibrous membrane that is loaded with combined-therapy drugs by using electrospinning technologies, which is further coated on a polydioxanone (PDO) stent and used for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). In order to improve treatment effectiveness, a combination of therapeutic drugs, i.e., curcumin (CUR) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is dissolved into SF solution and then eletrospun onto the surface of the PDO stent. The morphology, secondary structure, and in vitro drug release profiles of the membranes are characterized. The antitumor efficacy is assessed in vitro and in vivo using a human CRC cell line and normal cells, and tumor-bearing nude mice. In vitro and in vivo studies on the nanofibrous memembrane-coating demonstrate improved antitumor effects for the CUR/5-FU dual drug system which can be attributed to cell cycle arrest in the S phase in association with induced apoptosis in tumor cells by blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (Stat3) and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) signaling pathways, suggesting potential in the treatment of CRC in the future. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies. Cucurbitacin B (CuB) is a natural compound isolated from herbs and shows anticancer activity in several cancers. Material/Methods: Here, we analyzed the effects of different CuB concentrations on the proliferative and invasive behaviors of CRC cells using MTT, clonogenic assay, Transwell invasion, and wound healing assays. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the apoptotic effects of CuB on CRC cells. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to investigate the expression of apoptosis and Hippo-YAP signaling pathway proteins. Results: CuB inhibited the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells while promoting apoptosis. In addition, the Western blot and real-time PCR results indicated that CuB suppressed YAP expression and its downstream target genes Cyr 61 and c-Myc in CRC cells. To assess the underlying mechanism, we investigated the upstream regulating factor LATS1, and the results revealed that CuB upregulated LATS1 expression in CRC cells. Conclusions: In conclusion, our findings uncovered a novel therapeutic mechanism of CuB and suggest that there is therapeutic potential and feasibility in developing novel YAP inhibitors for cancer treatment. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Ternary transition-metal chalcogenide nanosheets have shown great potential in diverse applications owing to their intrinsically amazing properties with a broad tunable window. Direct preparation of water-soluble and biocompatible ternary chalcogenide nanosheets for theranostic application remains a challenge. In this article, we prepared Cu-Fe-Se nanosheets (CFS NSs) in an aqueous solution under ambient conditions by a sequential coprecipitation method. They were functionalized with anticancer drug doxorubin (CFS@DOX) through electrostatic interactions and labeled with radioactive isotope 99m Tc through surface coordination effect. The resulting nanosheets have a size of 70 nm and a thickness of 5 nm, and can be well dispersed in water, phosphate-buffered saline, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.9% NaCl with an excellent colloidal stability. They also exhibit a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 78.9% for in vitro and in vivo photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy. The isotope-labeled nanosheets ( 99m Tc-CFS NSs) were used for single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging to quantify their blood circulation time (∼4.7 h) and biodistributions in major organs, which follow an order of liver &gt; bladder &gt; lung &gt; spleen &gt; heart &gt; kidney. The DOX-functionalized nanosheets (CFS@DOX) were used for chemotherapy of cancer and exhibited excellent anticancer efficacy. Our research shows the great promise of ternary metal chalcogenide nanosheets for combined imaging and therapy of cancer. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Chemoenzymatic synthesis is an important strategy for the formation of glycopolymers. The use of a smaller number of traditional chemical steps and enzyme catalyzed reactions increases the yield of glycopolymer that can be produced by reducing the overall number of synthetic steps. In addition, chemoenzymatic routes are likely to be more accessible to those without a background in carbohydrate synthesis, making glycopolymers more available for studies across a broader range of scientists. Here, the enzymatic addition of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine functionalized glycodendrimers reduced the requisite number of synthetic steps for the full chemical synthesis of N-acetyl lactosamine (LacNAc) functionalized dendrimers to four steps. Unpurified cell lysate was used in the enzyme catalyzed glycosylation, and product glycodendrimers were readily purified by dialysis after enzymatic degradation of all protein components of the lysate in the crude reaction mixture. LacNAc functionalized dendrimers were used very effectively in homotypic cancer cellular aggregation assays and were found to either inhibit or enhance galectin-3 mediated cancer cellular aggregation, with differences in outcomes dependent on the generation of LacNAc functionalized dendrimers that were used.

    "Abstract": "Background: The dismal overall survival (OS) prognosis of glioblastoma, even after trimodal therapy, can be attributed mainly to the frequent incidence of intracranial relapse (ICR), which tends to present as an in-field recurrence after a radiation dose of 60 Gray (Gy). In this study, molecular marker-based prognostic indices were used to compare the outcomes of radiation with a standard dose versus a moderate dose escalation. Methods: This retrospective analysis included 156 patients treated between 2009 and 2016. All patients were medically fit for postoperative chemoradiotherapy. In the dose-escalation cohort a simultaneous integrated boost of up to 66 Gy (66 Gy RT) within small high-risk volumes was applied. All other patients received daily radiation to a total dose of 60 Gy or twice daily to a total dose of 59.2 Gy (60 Gy RT). Results: A total of 133 patients received standard 60 Gy RT, while 23 received 66 Gy RT. Patients in the 66 Gy RT group were younger (p < 0.001), whereas concomitant temozolomide use was more frequent in the 60 Gy RT group (p < 0.001). Other intergroup differences in known prognostic factors were not observed. Notably, the median time to ICR was significantly prolonged in the 66 Gy RT arm versus the 60 Gy RT arm (12.2 versus 7.6 months, p = 0.011), and this translated to an improved OS (18.8 versus 15.3 months, p = 0.012). A multivariate analysis revealed a strong association of 66 Gy RT with a prolonged time to ICR (hazard ratio = 0.498, p = 0.01) and OS (hazard ratio = 0.451, p = 0.01). These differences remained significant after implementing molecular marker-based prognostic scores (ICR p = 0.008, OS p = 0.007) and propensity-scored matched pairing (ICR p = 0.099, OS p = 0.023). Conclusion: Radiation dose escalation was found to correlate with an improved time to ICR and OS in this cohort of glioblastoma patients. However, further prospective validation of these results is warranted. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been widely recognized as essential regulators in human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Whether miR-769 is implicated in CRC progression remains elusive. The present study aimed to determine the function of miR-769 in CRC. Material/Methods: MiR-769 expression in CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were measured by quantitative real-time poly-merase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was utilized to determine the association between miR-769 expression and prognosis in CRC patients. The effects of miR-769 overexpression on CRC cell proliferation, cell cycle and invasion were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and Transwell assays. Western blot was utilized to assess the effect of miR-769 on HEY1 expression. Results: MiR-769 expression was decreased in CRC tissues. MiR-769 level was negatively correlated with the prognosis of CRC patients. Additionally, miR-769 overexpression remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, arrested CRC cells in G0 stage, and reduced cellular invasion. As to the mechanism, HEY1 was a direct target of miR-769; HEY1 level was inversely correlated with that of miR-769 in CRC tissues. Finally, overexpression of HEY1 reversed the effects of miR-769 on cell proliferation and invasion in CRC. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that miR-769 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells through targeting HEY1, which implied that miR-769 might be a novel therapeutic target for CRC treatment. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The risk of mesothelioma has been shown to be associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Most of the existing literature focuses on occupational exposure; however, non-occupational asbestos exposure has also been identified as an important risk factor. Objective: To estimate the association between mesothelioma and non-occupational asbestos exposure, and evaluate control recruitment and exposure measurement methods. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify case-control (CC) and cohort studies that examined the association between mesothelioma and non-occupational exposure to asbestos, including neighborhood, domestic, and household exposure. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate a summary relative risk estimate (SRRE) and 95% confidence interval using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were also conducted by exposure type, gender, region, and fiber type. Results: Twenty CC and 7 cohort studies were selected. Controls in CC studies were selected from the general population (55%), hospital records (18%), cancer registry (23%) and a combination of population and hospital records (5%). Multiple methods were used to measure neighborhood exposure (e.g., linear distance and direction of residence from an asbestos factory), domestic (e.g., whether living with an asbestos worker) and household exposure (e.g., whether involved in asbestos-containing home improvement projects). Primary meta-analyses suggested a SRRE of mesothelioma of 5.33 (95%CI: 2.53, 11.23) from neighborhood exposure, 4.31 (95%CI, 2.58, 7.20) from domestic exposure, and 2.41 (95%CI, 1.30, 4.48) from household exposure with large I 2 statistics ranging from 83-99%. Conclusions: Non-occupational asbestos exposure is significantly associated with an elevated risk of mesothelioma. Funnel plots indicated a potential of publication bias. Some SRREs should be interpreted with cautions because of high between-studies heterogeneity. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "An effective strategy to inhibit endocytosis in cancer cells is presented where modified net-type graphene oxide (GO) sheets, bound with multiple cell surface receptors, are introduced and synthesized as novel anticancer agents. The results suggest that the binding connects GO sheets with neighboring lipid rafts, neutralizes endocytosis, and causes metabolic deprivation. As a result, tumor cell survival and proliferation are reduced. Live cell confocal microscopy imaging reveals that GO-PEGFA (folate-PEGylated GO) (PEG, polyethylene glycol) is internalized by tumor cells, while GO-PEGRGD (tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp PEGylated GO) associates with the external cell membrane (not internalized). In vitro exposure of tumor cells to GO-PEGFA or GO-PEGRGD reduces the cell viability by 35%, compared to 50% reduction using methotrexate (100 μM). The combination of modified GO sheets with methotrexate or doxorubicin shows a greater toxicity (80% reduction in cell viability) than the individual agents. The proposed setup demonstrates a significant synergy in limiting tumor cell growth. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy suffers from some limitations such as poor bioavailability, rapid clearance from blood, poor cellular uptake, low tumor accumulation, severe side effects on healthy tissues and most importantly multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. Nowadays, a series of smart drug delivery system (DDS) based on amphiphilic drug conjugates (ADCs) has been developed to solve these issues, including polymer-drug conjugate (PDC), phospholipid-mimicking prodrugs, peptide-drug conjugates (PepDCs), pure nanodrug (PND), amphiphilic drug-drug conjugate (ADDC), and Janus drug-drug conjugate (JDDC). These ADCs can self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) or microbubbles (MBs) for targeted drug delivery by minimizing the net amount of excipients, realizing great goals, such as stealth behavior and physical integrity, high drug loading content, no premature leakage, long blood circulation time, fixed drug combination, and controlled drug-release kinetics. Besides, these self-assembled systems can be further used to load additional therapeutic agents and imaging contrast agents for combined therapy, personalized monitoring of in vivo tumor targeting, and the pharmacokinetics of drugs for predicting the therapeutic outcome. In this review, we will summarize the latest progress in the development of ADCs based combination chemotherapy and discuss the important roles for overcoming the tumor MDR.

    "Abstract": "A variety of thiazoles motif linked with diethyl 2-amino-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrrol-3-ylphosphonate were synthesized in 70 to 84% yields. Before the synthesis, the prospective biological activity spectrum was predicted for the suggested structures (and others) with PASS program, http://www.pharmaexpert.ru. Based on a preliminary assay of antiproliferative activity, selected six new phosphonates were evaluated against the most common human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines: HT-29, Caco-2, SW-1417, SW-480, SW-948, HCT-116, and HCT-15. Three phosphonates showed GI50 values within the range 2.18-7.77 μM compared with the standard reference, Adriamycin ranged 3.27-8.64 μM. Based on the knowledge about the role of the cyclooxygenase-2 into the cell growth and the inflammation mechanism, a hypothesis of molecular modeling study that included the fitting of all synthesized compounds into 2D and 3D-pharmacophore was undertaken. Discovery Studio 2.5 software was applied and the docking into human COX-2 enzyme revealed good results that are consistent with the pharmacological assessments. The experimental biological evaluation activities of new phosphonates showed high approximation with their molecular modeling results as well as the early prospecting prediction of biological activity. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Enhanced biocompatibility of nanosized contrast agent with high radiodensity and specific biodistribution is an important parameter for localized tumor imaging and organ safety. Various nanoparticles, especially gold nanorods (GNRs), have been applied for tumor diagnosis. However, their toxicity, nonspecific biodistribution, and easy aggregation are critical issues in cancer medicine. To avoid these issues, encapsulation of the GNRs in the core of nanoscopic mesoporous silica (MS) under ambient conditions, yielding multifunctional nanomaterials for cancer nanomedicine, is a recent and active development. Interestingly, GNR embedded MS nanohybrid (GNR-MS), though a promising material in nanomedicine, is rarely examined for tumor diagnosis, in vivo toxicity, organ safety, contrast ability, and excretion. Herein, we report a systematic in vivo examination of folic acid functionalized GNR-MS (GNR-MS-FA) for localized 4T1 breast tumor diagnosis, organ safety, and excretion using a one-time dose administration. The nanomaterials show good aqueous dispersibility, biocompatibility, high radiodensity, and tumor specific targeting ability (in vitro as well as in vivo). The in vivo tumor diagnosis and specific biodistribution of injected nanomaterials clearly demonstrates their potential for the visualization of tumors deep in the body of mice. In addition, all organs including the healthy glomerulus of the kidney are observed to be free of tissue injuries thereby indicating the superior biocompatibility of the nanomaterials.

    "Abstract": "The present study was aimed to explore the inhibitory potential of coumarin-hybrids bis-coumarin-iminothiazoles (5a-k) and coumarin-triazolothiadiazines (10a-j) against both tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (h-TNAP) and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (h-IAP) and to link their AP inhibitory potential with possible anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect. All investigated compounds were potent inhibitors of h-TNAP and h-IAP with several fold better inhibition as compared to standard drugs. In bis-coumarin-iminothiazole series, 5f (IC50=0.35±0.01 μM) was found as a lead candidate against h-TNAP demonstrating a ∼55-fold higher inhibitory potential as compared to levamisole, whereas, among coumarin-triazolothiadiazines, 10a (IC50=0.31±0.98 μM) showed ∼62-fold inhibitory potential. Similarly, compounds 5g and 10d were most potent inhibitors of h-IAP with an IC50 value of 0.22±0.87 and 0.56±0.04 μM, respectively. The detailed kinetic studies were conducted to probe the mechanism of inhibition. The four potent AP inhibitors 5f, 5h, 10a and 10g also showed maximum anti-proliferative effect in cancer cells and apoptosis via G2/M phase arrest. 10a and 5f showed maximum cytotoxicity in K-562 cells (89 and 80%, respectively) with IC50 values of about 2.37 and 7.81 μM, respectively. Our findings suggest these derivatives as potential anti-cancer candidates with profound anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic behavior along with the ability to block purinergic signaling. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "On the basis of the ‘one strain, many compounds’ (OSMAC) strategy, chemical investigation of the marine-derived fungus Trichothecium roseum resulted in the isolation of trichomide cyclodepsipeptides (compounds 1–4) from PDB medium, and destruxin cyclodepsipeptides (compounds 5–7) and cyclonerodiol sesquiterpenes (compounds 8–10) from rice medium. The structures and absolute configurations of novel (compounds 1, 8, and 9) and known compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses, X-ray crystallographic analysis, and ECD calculations. All isolated compounds were evaluated for cytotoxic, nematicidal, and antifungal activities, as well as brine shrimp lethality. The novel compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxic activities against the human cancer cell lines MCF-7, SW480, and HL-60, with IC 50 values of 0.079, 0.107, and 0.149 µM, respectively. In addition, it also showed significant brine shrimp lethality, with an LD 50 value of 0.48 µM, and moderate nematicidal activity against Heterodera avenae, with an LC 50 value of 94.9 µg/mL. This study constitutes the first report on the cytotoxic and nematicidal potential of trichomide cyclodepsipeptides. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "The development of novel Janus nanostructure with desired compositions and functionalities is essential for various applications, especially as drug delivery system to deliver multiple payloads with total different solubility. Here, a unidentified flying object (UFO)-like cyclodextrin–palladium nanosheet/zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 Janus nanoparticle (CD–PdNS/ZIF-8 JNP) prepared via a selective coating of polyacrylic acid (PAA) on one of the flat surfaces of 2D PdNS followed by further formation of ZIF-8 on a PAA template, and alternative modification of CDs on exposed PdNS surface is reported. The CD-PdNS and PAA-ZIF-8 parts are designed to load hydrophobic10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and hydrophilic doxorubicin (Dox) independently for synergistic chemotherapy (combination index = 0.65). Because of the broad near-infrared (NIR) absorption band of PdNSs, the photothermal effect of UFO-like CD-PdNS/ZIF-8 JNPs in NIR-II biowindow is studied. The in vitro and in vivo results show that the dual-drug loaded JNPs under a laser-irradiation group present highest cancer therapeutic efficiency. The good performance is due to the synergistic chemotherapy and photothermal therapy in NIR-II biowindow. This work significantly broadens the application prospects of metal–metal organic framework JNPs by rationally designing their compositions and discovering related physiochemical properties. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Background: HDIL-2 is approved for advanced melanoma based on its durable antitumor activity. MAGE-A3 cancer immunotherapeutic (MAGE-A3 CI) is a recombinant MAGE-A3 protein combined with an immunostimulant adjuvant system and has shown antitumor activity in melanoma. We assessed the safety and anti-tumor activity of HDIL-2 combined with MAGE-A3 CI in advanced melanoma. Methods: Patients with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV MAGE-A3-positive melanoma were enrolled in this phase II study. Treatment included an induction phase of MAGE-A3 CI plus HDIL-2 for 8 cycles followed by a maintenance phase of MAGE-A3 CI monotherapy. The primary endpoints were safety and objective response assessed per RECIST v1.1. Immune biomarker and correlative studies on tumor and peripheral blood were performed. Results: Eighteen patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients were evaluable for safety and sixteen for response. Responses occurred in 4/16 (25%) patients with 3 complete responses, and stable disease in 6/16 (38%) patients with a disease control rate of 63%. The median duration of response was not reached at median follow-up of 36.8 months. Induction therapy of HDIL-2 + MAGE-A3 CI had similar toxicities to those reported with HDIL-2 alone. Maintenance MAGE-A3 monotherapy was well-tolerated. Increased immune checkpoint receptor expression by circulating T regulatory cells was associated with poor clinical outcomes; and responders tended to have increased tumor infiltrating T cells in the baseline tumor samples. Conclusions: The safety profile of HDIL-2 + MAGE-A3 CI was similar to HDIL-2 monotherapy. Maintenance MAGE-A3 CI provides robust anti-tumor activity in patients who achieved disease control with induction therapy. Immune monitoring data suggest that MAGE-A3 CI plus checkpoint inhibitors could be a promising treatment for MAGE-A3-positive melanoma. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme, a type of deadly brain cancer, originates most commonly from astrocytes found in the brain. Current multimodal treatments for glioblastoma minimally increase life expectancy, but significant advancements in prognosis have not been made in the past few decades. Here we investigate cellular reprogramming for inhibiting the aggressive proliferation of glioblastoma cells. Cellular reprogramming converts one differentiated cell type into another type based on the principles of regenerative medicine. In this study, we used cellular reprogramming to investigate whether small molecule mediated reprogramming could convert glioblastoma cells into neurons. We investigated a novel method for reprogramming U87MG human glioblastoma cells into terminally differentiated neurons using a small molecule cocktail consisting of forskolin, ISX9, CHIR99021 I-BET 151, and DAPT. Treating U87MG glioblastoma cells with this cocktail successfully reprogrammed the malignant cells into early neurons over 13 days. The reprogrammed cells displayed morphological and immunofluorescent characteristics associated with neuronal phenotypes. Genetic analysis revealed that the chemical cocktail upregulates the Ngn2, Ascl1, Brn2, and MAP2 genes, resulting in neuronal reprogramming. Furthermore, these cells displayed decreased viability and lacked the ability to form high numbers of tumor-like spheroids. Overall, this study validates the use of a novel small molecule cocktail for reprogramming glioblastoma into nonproliferating neurons. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Passive immunotherapy, i.e., the administration of exogenous antibodies that recognize a specific target antigen, has gained significant momentum as a potential treatment strategy for several central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and brain cancer, among others. Advances in antibody engineering to create therapeutic antibody fragments or antibody conjugates have introduced new strategies that may also be applied to treat CNS disorders. However, drug delivery to the CNS for antibodies and other macromolecules has thus far proven challenging, due in large part to the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers that greatly restrict transport of peripherally administered molecules from the systemic circulation into the CNS. Here, we summarize the various passive immunotherapy approaches under study for the treatment of CNS disorders, with a primary focus on disease-specific and target site-specific challenges to drug delivery and new, cutting edge methods.

    "Abstract": "Background: The role of pretreatment Epstein-Barr virus DNA (pre-DNA) for individualized induction chemotherapy (IC) in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC) still remains unknown. We aimed to address this clinical issue. Methods: In total, data on 6218 patient with newly diagnosed LA-NPC receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without IC were retrospectively reviewed. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was adopted to calculate the cut-off value of pre-DNA based on disease-free survival (DFS). Propensity score matching (PSM) method was adopted to balance prognostic factors and match patients. Survival outcomes between IC + CCRT and CCRT groups were compared. Results: Among the original cohort, no survival difference between IC + CCRT and CCRT groups was found. The cut-off value of pre-DNA was 4650 copies/ml (area under curve [AUC], 0.620; sensitivity, 0.6224; specificity, 0.5673). For patients with Pre-DNA ≤ 4650 copies/ml, the IC + CCRT and CCRT groups also achieved comparable survival outcomes (P > 0.05 for all rates). However, IC + CCRT was associated with significantly improved 3-year DFS (78.6% vs. 74.8%, P = 0.03), overall survival (OS; 91.4% vs. 87.5%, P = 0.002) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; 86.0% vs. 82.2%, P = 0.036) for patient with pre-DNA > 4650 copies/ml. Multivariate analysis also confirm that IC + CCRT was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (HR, 0.817; 95% CI, 0.683-0.977; P = 0.027), OS (HR, 0.675; 95% CI, 0.537-0.848; P = 0.001) and DMFS (HR, 0.782; 95% CI, 0.626-0.976; P = 0.03). Conclusions: Pre-DNA may be a feasible and powerful consideration for individualized IC apart from other baseline clinical characteristics in LA-NPC. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The simple, sensitive, and specific detection of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is of great importance because of its crucial role in food safety, environmental pollution, and various pathological and physiological processes. Here, we reported activatable fluorescence nanoprobe-based quantum dots (QDs) for sensitive and selective monitoring of H 2 S in red wine, environmental water samples, and lysosome of live cancer cells. The nanoprobe was prepared through a strong electrostatic interaction between thioglycolic-acid-stabilized CdTe QDs and p-amino thiophenol capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) that resulted in the formation of the assembled nanostructure, called QD/AgNP nanocomplexes. The initial fluorescence of QDs was effectively quenched by the AgNPs because of the inner filter effect. Upon interaction with H 2 S, the strong etching ability of H 2 S to AgNPs could trigger the disassembly of QD/AgNP nanocomplexes and generate Ag 2 S on the surface of QDs, achieving a shell-core Ag 2 S/CdTe QDs with remarkable fluorescence as a result of the termination of inner filter effect. The aqueous solution studies displayed that the assembled QD/AgNP nanoprobe was sensitive to detect H 2 S, with a detection limit of 15 nM. In addition, this assembled QD/AgNP nanoprobe showed a high specificity toward H 2 S over other anions and biologically relevant species. The subsequent fluorescence imaging studies demonstrated that the assembled QD/AgNP nanoprobe exhibited high ability to enter into cellular lysosome and generated an enhancement fluorescence, which was used for endogenous H 2 S detection in lysosome of living cancer cells. This proposed nanoprobe revealed a more simple, rapid, time-saving, low-cost, sensitive, and selective process for monitoring of H 2 S in further environmental pollution, food safety, and clinical diagnosis of H 2 S-related diseases. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and a reactive stroma can affect T-cell infiltration and T-cell activity in the tumor and hereby influence response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). In the pursuit of finding biomarkers that predict treatment response, we evaluated the association between serum biomarkers of collagen and vimentin turnover and outcomes in metastatic melanoma patients treated with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab (IPI). Methods: Type III collagen formation (PRO-C3), MMP-degraded type I, type III and type IV collagens (C1M, C3M and C4M), and citrullinated and MMP-degraded vimentin (VICM) were measured with ELISAs in serum from metastatic melanoma patients before (n = 66) and 3 weeks after (n = 52) initiation of IPI treatment. Biomarker levels were associated with Disease Control Rate (DCR) and survival outcomes. Results: We found that baseline levels of PRO-C3 (p = 0.011), C1M (p = 0.003), C3M (p = 0.013) and C4M (p = 0.027) were significantly elevated in patients with progressive disease (PD). Univariate Cox regression analysis identified high PRO-C3 (p = 0.021) and C4M (p = 0.008) as predictors of poor overall survival (OS) and the biomarkers remained significant when evaluated with other covariates (PRO-C3 (p = 0.049) and C4M (p = 0.046)). Multivariate analysis identified VICM as a predictor of longer OS (p = 0.026). Similarly, a high C3M/PRO-C3 ratio predicted for increased OS (p = 0.034). Only C3M (p = 0.003) and VICM (p < 0.0001) increased 3 weeks after treatment. Conclusions: ECM and tissue remodeling quantified in pre-treatment serum were associated with response and survival outcomes in metastatic melanoma patients treated with IPI. This highlights the importance of addressing the ECM and stromal component non-invasively in future ICI studies. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: In the absence of head-to-head trials comparing axitinib with cabozantinib or everolimus, the aim of this study was to conduct an indirect comparison of their relative efficacy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), using data from the AXIS and METEOR trials. Methods: Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in prior sunitinib-treated patients with mRCC were compared by conducting matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) analyses, including base-case and sensitivity analyses. Individual patient-level data from prior sunitinib-treated patients who received axitinib in AXIS were weighted to match published baseline characteristics of prior sunitinib-treated patients who received either cabozantinib or everolimus in METEOR. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in PFS (aHR [adjusted hazard ratio] = 1.15 [CI: 0.82-1.63]) and OS (aHR = 1.00 [CI: 0.69-1.46]) between axitinib versus cabozantinib in the base-case analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, PFS (aHR = 1.39 [CI: 1.00-1.92]) and OS (aHR = 1.35 [CI: 0.95-1.92]) were shorter for axitinib compared with cabozantinib; however, the OS difference was not statistically significant. Axitinib was associated with significantly longer PFS compared with everolimus in the base-case (aHR = 0.53 [CI: 0.36-0.80]) and sensitivity analyses (aHR = 0.63 [CI: 0.45-0.88]), respectively. Results suggested an OS benefit for axitinib versus everolimus in base-case analyses (aHR = 0.63 [CI: 0.42-0.96]); however, the difference in OS in the sensitivity analysis was not statistically significant (aHR = 0.84 [CI: 0.59-1.18]). Conclusions: MAIC analyses suggest PFS and OS for axitinib and cabozantinib are dependent on the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center definition used; in the base-case analysis, there was no significant difference in PFS and OS between axitinib and cabozantinib. In the sensitivity analysis, PFS in favour of cabozantinib was significant; however, the trend for prolonged OS with cabozantinib was not significant. For axitinib and everolimus, MAIC analyses indicate patients treated with axitinib may have an improved PFS and OS benefit when compared to everolimus. Disparities between the base-case and sensitivity analyses in this study underscore the importance of adjusting for the differences in baseline characteristics and that naïve indirect comparisons are not appropriate. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), in which overexpression has been associated with various diseases, has become an attractive molecular target for the treatment of cancers. Thirty-two quinoxaline-derivatives of 3-substituted-4-(quinoxalin-6-yl) pyrazoles 14a–d, 15a–d, 16a–d, 17a–d, 18a–d, 19a–d, 25a, 25b, 25d, 26a, 26b, 26d, 27b, and 27d were synthesized and evaluated for their activin TGF-β type I receptor kinase and p38α mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitory activity in enzymatic assays. Among these compounds, the most active compound 19b inhibited TGF-β type I receptor kinase phosphorylation with an IC50 value of 0.28 µM, with 98% inhibition at 10 µM. Compound 19b also had good selectivity index of &gt;35 against p38α MAP kinase, with 9.0-fold more selective than clinical candidate, compound 3 (LY-2157299). A molecular docking study was performed to identify the mechanism of action of the synthesized compounds and their good binding interactions were observed. ADMET prediction of good active compounds showed that these ones possess good pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness behavior. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Definite prognostic clinical factors of benefit for decitabine-based induction chemotherapy in elderly patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are not identified. This study was designed to explore the potential biomarker, especially regeneration of haematopoiesis, of treatment response and survival in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. Method: We analysed the clinical data of 117 elderly AML patients who were treated with a decitabine dose of 15 mg/m 2 for 5 days, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor of 300 μg/d for priming, plus cytarabine 10 mg/m 2 q12h for 7 days and aclarubicin 10 mg/d for 4 days (D-CAG). Results: After initial induction chemotherapy, the overall response rate and complete remission (CR) were 71.8% and 58.1%, respectively. Patients responding to the D-CAG regimen achieved higher platelet counts on day 14 after initial treatment (p &lt; 0.001). Median counts were 59.5 × 10 9 /L in the CR group, 37 × 10 9 /L in the partial remission group and 28 × 10 9 /L in the non-responsive group. We then classified patients into those who achieved platelet counts≥60 × 10 9 /L or 100 × 10 9 /L on day 14 after D-CAG vs. those who did not. Platelet counts≥60 × 10 9 /L or 100 × 10 9 /L on day 14 were significantly associated with superior CR, overall survival and disease-free survival (80.9% vs. 45.3% p &lt; 0.001,16.5 vs. 9.1 months p = 0.009 and 16.3 vs. 7.4 months p = 0.024; 85.2% vs. 50% p = 0.001, 31 vs. 10.1 months p = 0.003 and 16.9 vs. 8.9 months p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis confirmed that poor cytogenetics (p = 0.010) and FLT3-ITD mutation (p = 0.007) were identified as independent factors of OS, but not platelet count (p = 0.091). However, platelet count≥100 × 10 9 /L on day 14 was an independent prognostic factor of CR and DFS. Conclusion: Platelet count recovery on day 14 after D-CAG induction chemotherapy is associated with response. Trial registration: D-CAG regimen was registered on ChicTR with number 11001700. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The abundant tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) could result in insufficient tumor retention and ineffective intratumor penetration of therapeutic agents as well as an acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes for many types of therapies. Therefore, developing strategies to modulate the TME by selectively degrading the condensed ECM may be helpful to improve existing cancer therapies. Herein, collagenase (CLG)-encapsulated nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) are synthesized based on Mn 2+ and an acid-sensitive benzoic-imine organic linker and then modified by polyethylene glycol (PEG). Upon intravenous (iv) injection, these CLG@NCP-PEG nanoparticles show efficient accumulation within the tumor, in which CLG would be released because of the collapse of NCP structures within the acidic TME. The released CLG enzyme could then specifically degrade collagens, the major component of ECM, leading to a loosened ECM structure, enhanced tumor perfusion, and relieved hypoxia. As a result, the second wave of nanoparticles, chlorin e6 (Ce6)-loaded liposomes (liposome@Ce6), would exhibit enhanced retention and penetration within the tumor. Such phenomena together with relieved tumor hypoxia could then lead to greatly enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect of liposome@Ce6 for mice pretreated with CLG@NCP-PEG. Our work thus presents a unique strategy for TME modulation using pH-responsive NCPs as smart enzyme carriers. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of target gene expression and cell development. Therefore, developing of accurate and visual detection methods for miRNAs is important for early diagnosis of cancer. In this study, we established a visual detection method for miRNA 155 based on DNAzyme amplification strategy in living cells. MnO 2 nanosheets were employed to deliver locked DNAzyme and substrate DNA into cells. The gold nanoparticle (AuNP) probe was taken up by cells autonomously. Then, MnO 2 nanosheets were reduced to Mn 2+ by glutathione in cells and DNA modules were released. MiRNA 155 took away locker DNA by strand displacement reaction to activate the DNAzyme. Then, the DNAzyme cleaved the substrate DNA and released single-stranded DNA named key DNA. Then, Key DNA hybridized with the hairpin DNA, making cy5 far away from AuNP and turning on its fluorescence. One target miRNA led to plenty of released key DNA when lots of substrate DNA was added. Thus, the visual detection of miRNA 155 in living cells would be initiated. Under confocal laser microscopy, the fluorescence was obviously observed in tumor cells but not in normal cells. The method has a linear range from 0.1 to 10 nM and a low detection limit of 44 pM on in vitro detection. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Skin color is derived from epidermal melanocytes that contain specialized organelles in which melanin is formed. The formation of melanin is a well-orchestrated process, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in numerous enzymatic conversions, such as the reactions catalyzed by tyrosinase and tyrosine hydroxylase. Currently, there is ample evidence that cold plasma exerts biological effects on cells through the impact of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Modulation of melanin biosynthesis by cold plasma has not yet been investigated. This study investigated melanin biosynthesis of human melanoma cell lines with different endogenous melanin contents (SK-Mel 28, G-361, FM-55-P and MNT-1) in response to cold plasma-derived reactive species. Initially, the distribution of melanosomes, via immunofluorescence, and the influence of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF), as a key transcription factor, was investigated. In our experimental setup, all of the tested cell lines had an elevated melanin content after exposure to cold plasma. These promising results suggest a novel potential application of cold plasma for the regulation of melanogenesis and may be a useful tool for influencing skin color in the future. © Walter de Gruyter GmbH.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Macrophages are crucial players in a variety of inflammatory responses to environmental cues. However, it has been widely reported that macrophages cause chronic inflammation and are involved in a variety of diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. In this study, we report the suppressive effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), via the HO-1-related system, on the immune response of the LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Results: RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS with or without ALA, and proinflammatory mediator expression levels and phagocytic ability were assessed. ALA treatment resulted in the attenuation of iNOS and NO expression and the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, cyclooxygenase2, IL-1β, IL-6). In addition, ALA treatment did not affect the phagocytic ability of macrophages. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the effect of ALA on macrophage function. Our findings suggest that ALA may have high potential as a novel anti-inflammatory agent. Conclusions: In the present study, we showed that exogenous addition of ALA induces HO-1 and leads to the downregulation of NO and some proinflammatory cytokines. These findings support ALA as a promising anti-inflammatory agent. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The application of nonviral gene vectors has been limited by their insufficient transfection efficiency because of poor serum stability, high endosomal entrapment, limited intracellular release, and low accumulation in the targeted organelle. It is still challenging to design gene carriers with properties that can overcome all of the barriers. We previously developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive cationic polymer, poly[(2-acryloyl)ethyl(p-boronic acid benzyl) diethylammonium bromide] (B-PDEAEA), which switches the charge at high concentrations of intracellular ROS to promote intracellular DNA release. However, its gene-delivery efficiency has been limited by serum instability and lysosomal trapping, and coating with an anionic PEGylated lipid only showed mild enhancement. Herein, we coated the ROS-responsive B-PDEAEA polymer with two cationic lipids to form ROS-responsive lipopolyplexes with integrated properties to overcome multiple delivery barriers. The surface cationic lipids endowed the nanocarrier with improved serum stability, effective cellular uptake, and lysosomal evasion. The interior B-PDEAEA/DNA polyplexes, which were highly stable in the extracellular environment, but quickly dissociated, released DNA, promoted nuclei localization, and achieved efficient transcription. The mechanisms of the ROS-responsive and charge-switchable properties of B-PDEAEA were quantitatively studied. The transfection efficiency and antitumor activity of lipopolyplexes were studied in vitro and in vivo. We found that the ROS-responsive lipopolyplexes effectively delivered therapeutic genes into cell nuclei and caused high tumor inhibition in mice bearing peritoneal or lung metastases. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The emergence of bacterial resistance is a major public health problem. It is essential to develop and synthesize new therapeutic agents with better activity. The mode of actions of certain newly developed antimicrobial agents, however, exhibited very limited effect in treating life threatening systemic infections. Therefore, the advancement of multi-potent and efficient antimicrobial agents is crucial to overcome the increased multi-drug resistance of bacteria and fungi. Cancer, which remains as one of the primary causes of deaths and is commonly treated by chemotherapeutic agents, is also in need of novel and efficacious agents to treat resistant cases. As such, a sequence of novel substituted benzamides was designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Methodology: All synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, NMR, Mass and elemental analysis followed by in vitro antimicrobial studies against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative (Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial and fungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) strains by the tube dilution method. The in vitro anticancer evaluation was carried out against the human colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCT116), using the Sulforhodamine B assay. Results, discussion and conclusion: Compound W6 (MICsa, st, kp = 5.19 μM) emerged as a significant antibacterial agent against all tested bacterial strains i.e. Gram-positive (S. aureus), Gram-negative (S. typhi, K. pneumoniae) while compound W1 (MICca, an = 5.08 μM) was most potent against fungal strains (A. niger and C. albicans) and comparable to fluconazole (MIC = 8.16 μM). The anticancer screening demonstrated that compound W17 (IC50 = 4.12 μM) was most potent amongst the synthesized compounds and also more potent than the standard drug 5-FU (IC50 = 7.69 μM).

    "Abstract": "Background: Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disorder with enigmatic etiopathogenesis and is characterized by tumor-like biological behaviors. Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have attracted considerable attention because they exert very important functions in the progression of human cancers. However, little is known about the functions and molecular mechanism of circRNAs in endometriosis. Material/Methods: A total of 20 patients with ovarian endometriosis and 4 normal endometrium from women free of endometriosis were included in this study. Ectopic endometrium tissues and paired eutopic endometrium tissues were collected from ovarian endometriosis patients. We assessed the expression profiles of circRNAs in endometriosis by microarray analysis. Expression of selected circRNAs in those tissues was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Based on the target prediction, we constructed a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and elucidated circRNAs through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology analyses. Results: We detected 2237 circRNAs, differentially expressed among 3 groups, and then found 8 circRNAs that may be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. The qRT-PCR validation suggested that circ_103470 and circ_101102 matched the microarray results. The functional analysis revealed 17 pathways, such as the mTOR signaling pathway, the Hippo signaling pathway, and the HIF-1 signaling pathway, which may be associated with the pathogenesis and development of endometriosis. Conclusions: In general, our results suggest that 2 downregulated circRNAs (circ_103470 and circ_101102) may regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in endometriosis via miR-141-5p, which may be a promising therapeutic target in the future. © Med Sci Monit, 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) induces high-energy radiation within cancer cells while avoiding damage to normal cells without uptake of BNCT drugs, which is holding great promise to provide excellent control over locally invasive malignant tumors. However, lack of quantitative imaging technique to determine local boron concentration has been a great challenge for nuclear physicians to apply accurate neutron irradiation during the treatment, which is a key factor that has limited BNCT's application in clinics. To meet this challenge, this study describes coating boronated porphyrins with a biocompatible poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-monomethoxy-poly(polyethylene-glycol) (PLGA-mPEG) micelle for selective tumor accumulation and reduced toxicity comparing with the previously reported boronated porphyrin drugs. Fluorescence imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were performed, unveiling the potential imaging properties of this boronated porphyrin nanocomplex (BPN) to locate tumor region and to determine tissue-localized boron concentration which facilitates treatment planning. By studying the pharmacokinetics of BPN with Cu-64 PET imaging, the treatment plan was adjusted from single bolus injection to multiple times of injections of smaller doses. As expected, high tumor uptake of boron (125.17 ± 13.54 ppm) was achieved with an extraordinarily high tumor to normal tissue ratio: tumors to liver, muscle, fat, and blood were 3.24 ± 0.22, 61.46 ± 20.26, 31.55 ± 10.30, and 33.85 ± 5.73, respectively. At last, neutron irradiation with BPN showed almost complete tumor suppression, demonstrating that BPN holds a great potential for being an efficient boron delivery agent for imaging-guided BNCT.

    "Abstract": "Copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles have been considered one of the most clinical relevant nanosystems because of their straightforward chemistry, small particle size, low toxicity, and intrinsic theranostic characteristics. In our previous studies, radioactive [ 64 Cu]CuS nanoparticles were successfully developed to be used as efficient radiotracers for positron emission tomography and for photothermal ablation therapy of cancer cells using near-infrared laser irradiation. However, the major challenge of CuS nanoparticles as a theranostic platform is the lack of a means for effective targeted delivery to the tumor site. To overcome this challenge, we designed and synthesized angiogenesis-targeting [ 64 Cu]CuS nanoparticles, which are coupled with cyclic RGDfK peptide [c(RGDfK)] through polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers using click chemistry. In assessing their tumor-targeting efficacy, we found that the tumor uptakes of [ 64 Cu]CuS-PEG-c(RGDfK) nanoparticles at 24 h after intravenous injection were significantly greater (8.6% ± 1.4% injected dose/gram of tissue) than those of nontargeted [ 64 Cu]CuS-PEG nanoparticles (4.3% ± 1.2% injected dose/gram of tissue, p &lt; 0.05). Irradiation of tumors in mice administered [ 64 Cu]CuS-PEG-c(RGDfK) nanoparticles induced 98.7% necrotic areas. In contrast, irradiation of tumors in mice administered nontargeted CuS-PEG nanoparticles induced 59% necrotic areas (p &lt; 0.05). The angiogenesis-targeting [ 64 Cu]CuS nanoparticles may serve as a promising platform for image-guided ablation therapy with high efficacy and minimal side effects in future clinical translation of this novel class of multifunctional nanomaterials.

    "Abstract": "Antigen-presenting cells play a dominant role in cancer immunotherapy. Tumor cells, however, can still resort to several mechanisms of immune evasion that ultimately lead to the development of tumor tissues. In the current study, we performed surface modification of live macrophages with nucleic acid aptamers with the aim to enhance their affinity for tumor cells. Intercellular adhesion of tumor cells to surface-modified macrophages and the functions of the macrophages when in contact with tumor cells were investigated. To immobilize thiol-terminated nucleic acid aptamers that showed high affinity for the membrane protein of the tumor cells, methacryloyl groups were delivered into the sialic acids of the macrophages via metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). The proposed surface modification was cytocompatible and did not induce any undesirable activation of macrophages. According to the cell proliferation assay, the density of aptamers immobilized on a macrophage was found to decrease over time. However, the presence of aptamers on the cell surface was observed for more than 24 h after the immobilization. The number of adherent tumor cells on aptamer-immobilized macrophages was significantly larger than that of non-immobilized macrophages. Although the number of adherent tumor cells on aptamer-immobilized macrophages was not influenced by the pretreatment of doxorubicin to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, the apoptosis-induced tumor cells were highly phagocytosed by the aptamer-immobilized macrophages. The secretion amount of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-12) from the macrophages was coincident with the phagocytic index, which increased with the phagocytic uptake of tumor cells by the macrophages. In addition, the expression level of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, required for antigen presentation, increased in nucleic acid aptamer-immobilized macrophages. Overall, the surface modification of macrophages with nucleic acid aptamers improved the tumor cell recognition of macrophages, indicating that the combination of cell surface engineering and anticancer drug treatment could constitute a promising strategy for tumor cell elimination.

    "Abstract": "Background: Psychosocial models including illness perception might explain individual differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and daily functioning in chronically ill patients. The aim of this study was to assess the association of illness perception among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with physical and mental HRQoL, adjusted for demographic variables, clinical variables and social support. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at a Viennese rheumatology outpatient clinic on 120 RA patients. Participants completed questionnaires on demographic and clinical characteristics, HRQoL (SF-36 Questionnaire), illness beliefs (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire) and social support (Social Support Scale-8). Analyses were performed with multivariate linear regression. Results: The mean physical was lower (38.38) than the mean mental SF-36 summary score (46.94). In univariate analysis, all domains of illness perception except belief in a chronic disease course were associated with physical and mental HRQoL. In multivariate analyses, illness perception accounted for 51% of variance in physical HRQoL. A stronger belief in the consequences of RA (consequences, β = - 0.33) and a stronger belief in repeated disease recurrence (timeline cyclical, β = - 0.31) were significantly associated with physical HRQoL in the fully adjusted model. Illness perception accounted for 45% of variance in mental HRQoL. Emotional representation (β = - 0.27) and fatigue (β = - 0.36) were significantly associated with mental HRQoL in the fully adjusted model. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of RA patients' beliefs about their illness and symptoms in relation to HRQoL. Identification of patients' perception of RA may be a way to positively influence disease outcomes such as quality of life as illness perception is amenable to intervention. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Abiespiroside A (1), beshanzuenone C (2), and beshanzuenone D (3) belong to the Abies sesquiterpenoid family. Beshanzuenones C (2) and D (3) are isolated from the critically endangered Chinese fir tree species Abies beshanzuensis and demonstrated weak inhibiting activity against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). We describe herein the first total syntheses of these Abies sesquiterpenoids relying on the sustainable and inexpensive chiral pool molecule (+)-carvone. The syntheses feature a palladium-catalyzed hydrocarbonylative lactonization to install the 6,6-fused bicyclic ring system and a Dreiding-Schmidt reaction to build the oxaspirolactone moiety of these target molecules. Our chemical total syntheses of these Abies sesquiterpenoids have enabled (i) the validation of beshanzuenone C's weak PTP1B inhibiting potency, (ii) identification of new synthetic analogs with promising and selective protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 inhibiting potency, and (iii) preparation of azide-tagged probe molecules for target identification via a chemoproteomic approach. The latter has resulted in the identification and evaluation of DNA polymerase epsilon subunit 3 (POLE3) as one of the novel cellular targets of these Abies sesquiterpenoids and their analogs. More importantly, via POLE3 inactivation by probe molecule 29 and knockdown experiment, we further demonstrated that targeting POLE3 with small molecules may be a novel strategy for chemosensitization to DNA damaging drugs such as etoposide in cancer. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Glioma is the most common highly aggressive, primary adult brain tumour. Clinical data show that therapeutic approaches cannot reach the expectations in patients, thus gliomas are mainly incurable diseases. Tumour cells can adapt rapidly to alterations during therapeutic treatments related to their metabolic rewiring and profound heterogeneity in tissue environment. Renewed interests aim to develop effective treatments targeting angiogenesis, kinase activity and/or cellular metabolism. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), whose hyper-activation is characteristic for many tumours, promotes metabolic alterations, macromolecule biosynthesis, cellular growth and survival. Unfortunately, mTOR inhibitors with their lower toxicity have not resulted in appreciable survival benefit. Analysing mTOR inhibitor sensitivity, other metabolism targeting treatments and their combinations could help to find potential agents and biomarkers for therapeutic development in glioma patients. Methods: In vitro proliferation assays, protein expression and metabolite concentration analyses were used to study the effects of mTOR inhibitors, other metabolic treatments and their combinations in glioma cell lines. Furthermore, mTOR activity and cellular metabolism related protein expression patterns were also investigated by immunohistochemistry in human biopsies. Temozolomide and/or rapamycin treatments altered the expressions of enzymes related to lipid synthesis, glycolysis and mitochondrial functions as consequences of metabolic adaptation; therefore, other anti-metabolic drugs (chloroquine, etomoxir, doxycycline) were combined in vitro. Results: Our results suggest that co-targeting metabolic pathways had tumour cell dependent additive/synergistic effects related to mTOR and metabolic protein expression patterns cell line dependently. Drug combinations, especially rapamycin + doxycycline may have promising anti-tumour effect in gliomas. Additionally, our immunohistochemistry results suggest that metabolic and mTOR activity alterations are not related to the recent glioma classification, and these protein expression profiles show individual differences in patients' materials. Conclusions: Based on these, combinations of different new/old drugs targeting cellular metabolism could be promising to inhibit high adaptation capacity of tumour cells depending on their metabolic shifts. Relating to this, such a development of current therapy needs to find special biomarkers to characterise metabolic heterogeneity of gliomas. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is still hindered by resistance and relapse, resulting in an overall poor survival rate. Recently, combining specific B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 inhibitors with compounds downregulating myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl)-1 has been proposed as a new effective strategy to eradicate resistant AML cells. We show here that 1(R), 6(S), 1’(R), 6’(S), 11(R), 17(S)-fistularin-3, a bromotyrosine compound of the fistularin family, isolated from the marine sponge Suberea clavata, synergizes with Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 to efficiently kill Mcl-1/Bcl-2-positive AML cell lines, associated with Mcl-1 downregulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress induction. The absolute configuration of carbons 11 and 17 of the fistularin-3 stereoisomer was fully resolved in this study for the first time, showing that the fistularin we isolated from the marine sponge Subarea clavata is in fact the (+)-11(R), 17(S)-fistularin-3 stereoisomer keeping the known configuration 1(R), 6(S), 1’(R), and 6’(S) for the verongidoic acid part. Docking studies and in vitro assays confirm the potential of this family of molecules to inhibit DNA methyltransferase 1 activity. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Adipocytes make up the major component of breast tissue, accounting for 90% of stromal tissue. Thus, the crosstalk between adipocytes and breast cancer cells may play a critical role in cancer progression. Adipocyte-breast cancer interactions have been considered important for the promotion of breast cancer metastasis. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these interactions are unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of adipocyte-mediated breast cancer metastasis. Methods: Breast cancer cells were cocultured with mature adipocytes for migration and 3D matrix invasion assays. Next, lentivirus-mediated loss-of-function experiments were used to explore the function of lysyl hydroxylase (PLOD2) in breast cancer migration and adipocyte-dependent migration of breast cancer cells. The role of PLOD2 in breast cancer metastasis was further confirmed using orthotopic mammary fat pad xenografts in vivo. Clinical samples were used to confirm that PLOD2 expression is increased in tumor tissue and is associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Cells were treated with cytokines and pharmacological inhibitors in order to verify which adipokines were responsible for activation of PLOD2 expression and which signaling pathways were activated in vitro. Results: Gene expression profiling and Western blotting analyses revealed that PLOD2 was upregulated in breast cancer cells following coculture with adipocytes; this process was accompanied by enhanced breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Loss-of-function studies indicated that PLOD2 knockdown suppressed cell migration and disrupted the formation of actin stress fibers in breast cancer cells and abrogated the migration induced by following coculture with adipocytes. Moreover, experiments performed in orthotopic mammary fat pad xenografts showed that PLOD2 knockdown could reduce metastasis to the lung and liver. Further, high PLOD2 expression correlated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Mechanistically, adipocyte-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leptin may facilitate PLOD2 upregulation in breast cancer cells and promote breast cancer metastasis in tail vein metastasis assays. Further investigation revealed that adipocyte-derived IL-6 and leptin promoted PLOD2 expression through activation of the JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Conclusions: Our study reveals that adipocyte-derived IL-6 and leptin promote PLOD2 expression by activating the JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, thus promoting breast cancer metastasis. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this research was to explore health professionals' perspectives on the provision of follow-up cancer care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients in Queensland. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Indigenous and non-Indigenous health professionals who had experience providing care for Indigenous cancer patients in the primary health care and hospital setting. Results: Participants were recruited from six Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (n = 17) and from a tertiary hospital (n = 9) across urban, regional, and remote geographical settings. Culturally safe care, psychological support, determining patient needs, practical assistance, and advocating for Indigenous health were identified as enablers to support the needs of Indigenous patients when accessing cancer care, and Indigenous health professionals were identified as the key enabler. Conclusion: Indigenous health professionals significantly contribute to the provision of culturally competent follow-up cancer care by increasing the accessibility of follow-up cancer care services and by supporting the needs of Indigenous cancer patients. All health professionals need to work together and be sufficiently skilled in the delivery of culturally competent care to improve the Indigenous cancer journey and outcomes for Indigenous people. Effective organizational policies and practices are crucial to enable all health professionals to provide culturally competent and responsive cancer care to Indigenous Australians. © 2018 de Witt, Cunningham, Bailie, Percival, Adams and Valery.",

    "Abstract": "Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) consists of small fragments of DNA that circulate freely in the bloodstream. In cancer patients, a fraction of cfDNA is derived from tumour cells, therefore containing the same genetic and epigenetic alterations, and is termed circulating cell-free tumour DNA. The potential use of cfDNA, the so-called 'liquid biopsy', as a non-invasive cancer biomarker has recently received a lot of attention. The present review will focus on studies concerning the potential clinical applications of cfDNA in ovarian cancer patients.",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, and its morbidity and mortality both rank third among all malignant tumors in China. Rectal cancer accounts for 60%-70% of cases of CRC. With the in-depth study of the pathogenesis of CRC and the mechanism of tumor metastasis, and the improvement of surgical techniques and methods, anal sphincter surgery for middle and low rectal cancer is increasing gradually. Although the quality of life of the patients improves significantly after anal sphincter preservation for rectal cancer, anastomotic leakage is still one of the most common and serious complications. Studies show that the incidence of anastomotic leakage after surgery for low rectal cancer is 3%-21%, and the death rate is up to 3%. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of patients and analysis of risk factors before operation is of great significant for reducing the potential risk of anastomotic leakage and choosing surgical approach and appropriate preventive measures to prevent and reduce the occurrence of anastomotic leakage. In this paper, we summarize the recent research on anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer surgery in order to help other clinicians reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage in clinical practice. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "The effectiveness of HPV vaccine against HSIL+ (pathologically diagnosed CIN2+) in the first cohort in Japan was investigated in 22,743 women aged 20 to 29 years (parts of national cervical cancer screening program of FY [fiscal year] 2015, the Japan Cancer Society). Vaccinated women had a statistically significant 69% lower risk of HSIL+ as compared to the unvaccinated women; the crude relative risk estimate was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.11–0.83; p-value = 0.013) by normal approximation and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.08–0.80; p-value = 0.009) by the exact Poisson regression. The effect of age was not significant (chisq = 7.7 (df = 9), p-value = 0.569) and the estimate of relative risk remained essentially intact after adjustment for age. This study brings scientific evidence on the effectiveness of HPV vaccine on development of cervical high grade lesions. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "African American women are substantially underrepresented in breast cancer genetic research studies and clinical trials, yet they are more likely to die from breast cancer. Lack of trust in the medical community is a major barrier preventing the successful recruitment of African Americans into research studies. When considering the city of Memphis, TN, where the percentage of African Americans is significantly higher than the national average and it has a high rate of breast cancer mortality inequities among African American women, we evaluated the feasibility of utilizing a community-based participatory (CBPR) approach for recruiting African American women into a breast cancer genetic study, called the Sistas Taking A Stand for Breast Cancer Research (STAR) study. From June 2016 and December 2017, African American women age 18 and above were recruited to provide a 2 mL saliva specimen and complete a health questionnaire. A total of 364 African American women provided a saliva sample and completed the health questionnaire. Greater than 85% agreed to be contacted for future studies. Educational workshops on the importance of participating in cancer genetic research studies, followed by question and answer sessions, were most successful in recruitment. Overall, the participants expressed a strong interest and a willingness to participate in the STAR study. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing a CBPR approach that provides an educational component detailing the importance of participating in cancer genetic research studies and that includes prominent community advocates to build trust within the community. © 2018 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "Background: Recent data suggest that the United States is in the midst of an epidemiologic transition in the leading cause of death. Objective: To examine county-level sociodemographic differences in the transition from heart disease to cancer as the leading cause of death in the United States. Design: Observational study. Setting: U.S. death records, 2003 to 2015. Participants: Decedents aged 25 years or older, classified by racial/ethnic group. Measurements: All-cause, heart disease, and cancer mortality stratified by quintiles of county median household income. Age-and sex-adjusted mortality rates and average annual percentage of change were calculated. Results: Heart disease was the leading cause of death in 79% of counties in 2003 and 59% in 2015. Cancer was the leading cause of death in 21% of counties in 2003 and 41% in 2015. The shift to cancer as the leading cause of death was greatest in the highest-income counties. Overall, heart disease mortality rates decreased by 28% (30% in high-income counties vs. 22% in low-income counties) from 2003 to 2015, and cancer mortality rates decreased by 16% (18% in high-income counties vs. 11% in low-income counties). In the lowest-income counties, heart disease remained the leading cause of death among all racial/ethnic groups, and improvements were smaller for both heart disease and cancer. Limitation: Use of county median household income as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Conclusion: Data show that heart disease is more likely to be the leading cause of death in low-income counties. Low-income counties have not experienced the same decrease in mortality rates as high-income counties, which suggests a later transition to cancer as the leading cause of death in low-income counties. © 2018 American College of Physicians.

    "Abstract": "Fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) is a cancer antigen expressed in the majority of breast cancer tissues and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of FSIP1 in the progression and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been explored. Here, we show that FSIP1 deficiency by shRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout significantly inhibits the proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells and impairs chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition in vivo. Computational modeling predicted that FSIP1 binds to ULK1, and this was established by coimmunoprecipitation. FSIP1 deficiency promoted autophagy, enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and decreased mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin activity. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of autophagy restored the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in TNBC cells. Our findings uncover a role of FSIP1 as well as mechanisms underlying FSIP1 action in drug sensitivity and may, therefore, aid in design of TNBC therapies. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Background: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. Recent evidence suggests that RNA editing of antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) RNA is emerging as a key epigenetic alteration underlying cancer pathogenesis. Methods: We evaluated AZIN1 RNA editing levels, and the expression of its regulator, ADAR1, in 280 gastric tissues from 140 patients, using a RNA editing site-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. We also analyzed the clinical significance of these results as disease biomarkers in gastric cancer (GC) patients. Results: Both AZIN1 RNA editing levels and ADAR1 expression were significantly elevated in GC tissues compared with matched normal mucosa (P < 0.0001, 0.0008, respectively); and AZIN1 RNA editing was positively correlated with ADAR1 expression. Elevated expression of ADAR1 significantly correlated with poor overall survival (P = 0.034), while hyper-edited AZIN1 emerged as an independent prognostic factor for OS and disease-free survival in GC patients [odds ratio (OR):1.98, 95% CI 1.17-3.35, P = 0.011, OR: 4.55, 95% CI 2.12-9.78, P = 0.0001, respectively]. Increased AZIN1 RNA editing and ADAR1 over-expression were significantly correlated with key clinicopathological factors, such as advanced T stage, presence of lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and higher TNM stages in GC patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that hyper-editing status of AZIN1 RNA was an independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis in GC patients [hazard ratio (HR):3.03, 95% CI 1.19-7.71, P = 0.02]. Conclusions: AZIN1 RNA editing levels may be an important prognostic biomarker in GC patients, and may serve as a key clinical decision-making tool for determining preoperative treatment strategies in GC patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: To quantify temporal trends in age-standardized rates of disease, the convention is to fit a linear regression model to log-transformed rates because the slope term provides the estimated annual percentage change. However, such log-transformation is not always appropriate. Methods: We propose an alternative method using the rank-ordered logit (ROL) model that is indifferent to log-transformation. This method quantifies the temporal trend using odds, a quantity commonly used in epidemiology, and the log-odds corresponds to the scaled slope parameter estimate from linear regression. The ROL method can be implemented by using the commands for proportional hazards regression in any standard statistical package. We apply the ROL method to estimate temporal trends in age-standardized cancer rates worldwide using the cancer incidence data from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents plus (CI5plus) database for the period 1953 to 2007 and compare the estimates to their scaled counterparts obtained from linear regression with and without log-transformation. Results: We found a strong concordance in the direction and significance of the temporal trends in cancer incidence estimated by all three approaches, and illustrated how the estimate from the ROL model provides a measure that is comparable to a scaled slope parameter estimated from linear regression. Conclusions: Our method offers an alternative approach for quantifying temporal trends in incidence or mortality rates in a population that is invariant to transformation, and whose estimate of trend agrees with the scaled slope from a linear regression model. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Even when targets responsible for chemoresistance are identified, drug development is often hampered due to the poor druggability of these proteins. We systematically analyzed therapy-resistance with a large-scale cancer cell transcriptome and drug-response datasets and predicted the candidate drugs based on the gene expression profile. Our results implicated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition as a common mechanism underlying resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Notably, we identified ITGB3, whose expression was abundant in both drug resistance and mesenchymal status, as a promising target to overcome chemoresistance. We also confirmed that depletion of ITGB3 sensitized cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Considering the poor druggability of ITGB3 and the lack of feasible drugs to directly inhibit this protein, we took an in silico screening for drugs mimicking the transcriptome-level changes caused by knockdown of ITGB3. This approach successfully identified atorvastatin as a novel candidate for drug repurposing, paving an alternative path to drug screening that is applicable to undruggable targets. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "We report an approach in diagnostic imaging based on nanoscale-resolution scanning of surfaces of cells collected from body fluids using a recent modality of atomic force microscopy (AFM), subresonance tapping, and machine-leaning analysis. The surface parameters, which are typically used in engineering to describe surfaces, are used to classify cells. The method is applied to the detection of bladder cancer, which is one of the most common human malignancies and the most expensive cancer to treat. The frequent visual examinations of bladder (cytoscopy) required for follow-up are not only uncomfortable for the patient but a serious cost for the health care system. Our method addresses an unmet need in noninvasive and accurate detection of bladder cancer, which may eliminate unnecessary and expensive cystoscopies. The method, which evaluates cells collected from urine, shows 94% diagnostic accuracy when examining five cells per patient’s urine sample. It is a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in diagnostic accuracy compared with the currently used clinical standard, cystoscopy, as verified on 43 control and 25 bladder cancer patients. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

    "Abstract": "To address the identity of castration-resistant prostate cells in vivo, Barros-Silva et al. coupled single-cell analysis with organoid culture and in situ lineage tracing. They identify LY6D as a progenitor marker that liaises intrinsically castration-resistant luminal cells and castration-resistant prostate tumor growth. © 2018 The AuthorsThe exact identity of castrate-resistant (CR) cells and their relation to CR prostate cancer (CRPC) is unresolved. We use single-cell gene profiling to analyze the molecular heterogeneity in basal and luminal compartments. Within the luminal compartment, we identify a subset of cells intrinsically resistant to castration with a bi-lineage gene expression pattern. We discover LY6D as a marker of CR prostate progenitors with multipotent differentiation and enriched organoid-forming capacity. Lineage tracing further reveals that LY6D + CR luminal cells can produce LY6D − luminal cells. In contrast, in luminal cells lacking PTEN, LY6D + cells predominantly give rise to LY6D + tumor cells, contributing to high-grade PIN lesions. Gene expression analyses in patients’ biopsies indicate that LY6D expression correlates with early disease progression, including progression to CRPC. Our studies thus identify a subpopulation of luminal progenitors characterized by LY6D expression and intrinsic castration resistance. LY6D may serve as a prognostic maker for advanced prostate cancer. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Tumor exosomes that inherit molecular markers from their parent cells are emerging as cellular \"surrogates\" in cancer diagnostics. Molecular profiling and detection of exosomes offer a noninvasive access to the state of cancer progression, yet are still technically challenging. Here we report an exosome-oriented, aptamer nanoprobe-based profiling (ExoAPP) assay to phenotype surface proteins and quantify cancerous exosomes in a facile mix-and-detect format. Our ExoAPP interfaces graphene oxide (GO) with target-responsive aptamers to profile exosomal markers across five cell types by complementing with enzyme-assisted exosome recycling, revealing a heterogeneous pattern.This assay achieves a detection limit down to 1.6 × 10 5 particles/mL, lowered by several orders of magnitude over other homogeneous protocols. Such a sensitive ExoAPP assay allows for monitoring epithelial-mesenchymal transition through heterogeneous exosomes without involving cellular internalization that often occurs in GO-based cargo delivery. Using ExoAPP to analyze blood samples from prostate cancer patients, we find that target exosome can be identified by surface PSMA, suggesting their potential in clinical diagnosis.

    "Abstract": "The toxic side effects of postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy in gastric cancer (GC) often cause patients to have cancer cachexia and poor quality of life. Dietary adjuvant therapy can significantly promote GC patients to recover the body function, alleviate inflammation, improve anticancer treatment tolerance, improve postoperative quality of life and prolong survival. Given the advantages of diet in the postoperative treatment of GC, this paper discusses the role of modern medicine’s elemental nutrition diet and traditional Chinese medicine diet in the postoperative treatment of GC, which can help clinicians better understand traditional Chinese medicine treatment in relieving the overall dysfunction of the body. Furthermore, the combination of traditional Chinese medicine diet with the modern medical nutrition diet evaluation system can expand the use of traditional Chinese medicine diet in the clinical treatment of GC. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "Background: In current best practise, curatively intended treatment for oesophageal cancer usually consists of neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT) or perioperative chemotherapy, and oesophagectomy. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) has the potential to identify patients without lymph node metastases and thus improve the staging accuracy and influence treatment. The impact of neoadjuvant treatment on the lymphatic drainage of oesophageal cancers and subsequently the SLNB procedure in this tumour type has previously not been well studied. Purpose: To evaluate changes in lymphatic drainage patterns of the tumour in patients with cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) using Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) hybrid SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy before and after nCRT. Methods: Patients with clinical stage T2-T3, any N-stage, M0 cancer of the oesophagus or GOJ underwent endoscopically guided peri-/intratumoral injection of radio-colloid followed by hybrid SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy prior to, and once again following, nCRT. SPECT/CT images were evaluated to number and location of SLNs and compared between the two examinations. Results: Ten patients were included in this pilot trial. SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy was performed in twenty procedures. The same Sentinel Lymph Node station before and after nCRT was observed in one single patient. In two patients, no SLN was detected before nCRT. In three patients no SLN was detected following nCRT. In four patients, the SLN stations were not the same station at baseline compared to follow-up examination. Conclusions: The reproducibility SLN detection in patients with cancer of the oesophagus/GOJ following nCRT was very poor. nCRT appears to alter lymphatic drainage patterns and thus may affect detection of SLNs and potentially also the accuracy of an SLNB in these patients. On the basis of these initial results, we abort further patient recruitment in our institution. Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR).

    "Abstract": "Background: The development of molecular techniques to estimate the risk of breast cancer recurrence has been a significant addition to the suite of tools available to pathologists and breast oncologists. It has previously been shown that immunohistochemistry can provide a surrogate measure of tumor recurrence risk, effectively providing a less expensive and more rapid estimate of risk without the need for send-out. However, concordance between gene expression-based and immunohistochemistry-based approaches has been modest, making it difficult to determine when one approach can serve as an adequate substitute for the other. We investigated whether immunohistochemistry-based methods can be augmented to provide a useful therapeutic indicator of risk. Methods: We studied whether the Oncotype DX breast cancer recurrence score can be predicted from routinely acquired immunohistochemistry of breast tumor histology. We examined the effects of two modifications to conventional scoring measures based on ER, PR, Ki-67, and Her2 expression. First, we tested a mathematical transformation that produces a more diagnostic-relevant representation of the staining attributes of these markers. Second, we considered the expression of BCL-2, a complex involved in regulating apoptosis, as an additional prognostic marker. Results: We found that the mathematical transformation improved concordance rates over the conventional scoring model. By establishing a measure of prediction certainty, we discovered that the difference in concordance between methods was even greater among the most certain cases in the sample, demonstrating the utility of an accompanying measure of prediction certainty. Including BCL-2 expression in the scoring model increased the number of breast cancer cases in the cohort that were considered high certainty, effectively expanding the applicability of this technique to a greater proportion of patients. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate an improvement in concordance between immunohistochemistry-based and gene expression-based methods to predict breast cancer recurrence risk following two simple modifications to the conventional scoring model. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Serrated adenocarcinomas are an aggressive and treatment-resistant form of colorectal cancer. Nakanishi et al. show that expression of atypical PKCs is reduced in human serrated tumors and that their loss results in spontaneous serrated tumorigenesis with stromal activation and immunosuppression in mice. The simultaneous inhibition of stromal activation combined with anti-PD-L1 showed synergistic therapeutic potential. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.Serrated adenocarcinoma, an alternative pathway for colorectal cancer (CRC) development, accounts for 15%–30% of all CRCs and is aggressive and treatment resistant. We show that the expression of atypical protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) and PKCλ/ι was reduced in human serrated tumors. Simultaneous inactivation of the encoding genes in the mouse intestinal epithelium resulted in spontaneous serrated tumorigenesis that progressed to advanced cancer with a strongly reactive and immunosuppressive stroma. Whereas epithelial PKCλ/ι deficiency led to immunogenic cell death and the infiltration of CD8 + T cells, which repressed tumor initiation, PKCζ loss impaired interferon and CD8 + T cell responses, which resulted in tumorigenesis. Combined treatment with a TGF-β receptor inhibitor plus anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade showed synergistic curative activity. Analysis of human samples supported the relevance of these kinases in the immunosurveillance defects of human serrated CRC. These findings provide insight into avenues for the detection and treatment of this poor-prognosis subtype of CRC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is considered more clinically relevant in mimicking the structural and physiological conditions of tumors in vivo compared to two-dimensional cell cultures. In recent years, high-throughput screening (HTS) in 3D cell arrays has been extensively used for drug discovery because of its usability and applicability. Herein, we developed a microfluidic spheroid culture device (µFSCD) with a concentration gradient generator (CGG) that enabled cells to form spheroids and grow in the presence of cancer drug gradients. The device is composed of concave microwells with several serpentine micro-channels which generate a concentration gradient. Once the colon cancer cells (HCT116) formed a single spheroid (approximately 120 µm in diameter) in each microwell, spheroids were perfused in the presence of the cancer drug gradient irinotecan for three days. The number of spheroids, roundness, and cell viability, were inversely proportional to the drug concentration. These results suggest that the µFSCD with a CGG has the potential to become an HTS platform for screening the efficacy of cancer drugs. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To explore the effect of accelerated rehabilitation program on the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). METHODS A total of 52 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent PD from January 2015 to August 2017 at Tianjin Baodi People’s Hospital were selected and randomly divided into two groups to receive either enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS; n = 24) or traditional surgery (n = 28). Patients in the ERAS group were given nursing care according to the concept of accelerated rehabilitation surgery, while patients in the traditional surgery group were given traditional routine care. Hospitalization time, time to postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function, hospitalization cost, and complications including delayed pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, abdominal hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, death, and re-hospitalization were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Postoperative hospital stay and time to postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function were significantly shorter in the ERAS group than in the traditional surgery group. The cost of hospitalization was significantly lower in the ERAS group than in the traditional surgery group (P < 0.05). The incidence of complications in the ERAS group was 45.83%, which was significantly lower than that of the traditional group (75.00%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Accelerated rehabilitation program is more effective than conventional strategy in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing PD, with high safety and feasibility. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "Electrochemical sensors for early tumor cell detection are currently an important area of research, as this special region directly improves the efficiency of cancer treatment. Functional graphene is a promising alternative for selective recognition and capture of target cancer cells. In our work, an effective cytosensor of hyaluronate-functionalized graphene (HG) was prepared through chemical reduction of graphene oxide. The as-prepared HG nanostructures were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy coupled with cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The self-assembly of HG with ethylene diamine, followed by sodium hyaluronate, enabled the fabrication of a label-free electrochemical impedance spectroscopy cytosensor with high stability and biocompatibility. Finally, the proposed cytosensor exhibited satisfying electrochemical behavior and cell-capture capacity for human colorectal cancer cells HCT-116, and also displayed a wide linear range, from 5.0 × 10 2 cells·mL -1 to 5.0 × 10 6 cells·mL -1 , and a low detection limit of 100 cells·mL -1 (S/N = 3) for quantification. This work paves the way for graphene applications in electrochemical cytosensing and other bioassays. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Development of tamoxifen resistance remains a tremendous challenge for the treatment of estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily play crucial roles in intracellular trafficking and cell signaling, and aberrant small-GTPase signaling is implicated in many types of cancer. In this study, we employed a targeted, quantitative proteomic approach that relies on stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), gel fractionation, and scheduled multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) analysis, to assess the differential expression of small GTPases in MCF-7 and the paired tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. The method displayed superior sensitivity and reproducibility over the shotgun-proteomic approach, and it facilitated the quantification of 96 small GTPases. Among them, 13 and 10 proteins were significantly down- and up-regulated (with >1.5-fold change), respectively, in the tamoxifen-resistant line relative to in the parental line. In particular, we observed a significant down-regulation of RAB31 in tamoxifen-resistant cells, which, in combination with bioinformatic analysis and downstream validation experiments, supported a role for RAB31 in tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast-cancer cells. Together, our results demonstrated that the targeted proteomic method constituted a powerful approach for revealing the role of small GTPases in therapeutic resistance.

    "Abstract": "Background: Oncolytic viruses have been proposed to be employed as a potential treatment of cancer. Well targeted, they will serve the purpose of cracking tumor cells without causing damage to normal cells. In this category of oncolytic viral drugs human pathogens herpes simplex virus (HSV) is especially suitable for the cause. Although most viral infection causes antiviral reaction in the host, HSV has multiple mechanisms to evade those responses. Powerful anti-tumor effect can thus be achieved via genetic manipulation of the HSV genes involved in this evading mechanism, namely deletions or mutations that adapt its function towards a tumor microenvironment. Currently, oncolytic HSV (oHSV) is widely use in clinical; moreover, there's hope that its curative effect will be further enhanced through the combination of oHSV with both traditional and emerging therapeutics. Results: In this review, we provide a summary of the HSV host antiviral response evasion mechanism, HSV expresses immune evasion genes such as ICP34.5, ICP0, Us3, which are involved in inducing and activating host responses, so that the virus can evade the immune system and establish effective long-term latent infection; we outlined details of the oHSV strains generated by removing genes critical to viral replication such as ICP34.5, ICP0, and inserting therapeutic genes such as LacZ, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); security and limitation of some oHSV such G207, 1716, OncoVEX, NV1020, HF10, G47 in clinical application; and the achievements of oHSV combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusion: We reviewed the immunotherapy mechanism of the oHSV and provided a series of cases. We also pointed out that an in-depth study of the application of oHSV in cancer treatment will potentially benefits cancer patients more. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is the plasma cell tumor, which is characterized by clonal proliferation of tumor cells, with high risk of progression to renal impairment, bone damage and amyloidosis. Although the survival rate of patients with MM has improved in the past decade, most people inevitably relapse. The treatment and prognosis of MM are still urgent problems. Breast Cancer Antiestrogen Resistance 3 (BCAR3) is a protein-coding gene that is associated with many tumors. However, there have been few studies on the relationship of BCAR3 and MM. Methods: We analyzed 1878 MM patients (1930 samples) from 7 independent datasets. First, we compared the BCAR3 expression level of MM patients in different stages and MM patients with different amplification of 1q21. Second, we analyzed BCAR3 expression levels in MM patients with different molecular subtypes. Finally, we explored the event-free survival rate (EFS) and overall survival rate (OS) of MM patients with high or low BCAR3 expression, including patients before and after relapse, and their therapeutic responses to bortezomib and dexamethasone. Results: The expression of BCAR3 showed a decreasing trend in stages I, II and III (P = 0.00068). With the increase of 1q21 amplification level, the expression of BCAR3 decreased (P = 0.022). Patients with high BCAR3 expression had higher EFS and OS (EFS: P < 0.0001, OS: P < 0.0001). The expression of BCAR3 gene before relapse was higher than that after relapse (P = 0.0045). BCAR3 is an independent factor affecting prognosis (EFS: P = 5.17E-03; OS: P = 3.33E-04). Conclusion: We found that high expression level of BCAR3 predicted better prognosis of MM patients. Low expression of BCAR3 at diagnosis can predict early relapse. BCAR3 is an independent prognostic factor for MM. BCAR3 can be used as a potential biomarker. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study reports a case of Unilateral Endogenous Fungal Endophthalmitis After Esophageal Cancer Surgery. Case presentation: One patient presented with a month-long loss of vision in his left eye, he had surgery for esophageal cancer 2 months earlier. The patient underwent cataract surgery (by phacoemulsification) in the left eye combined with 25-gauge vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade. The microbiological culture pointed to infection with Candida albicans. At 3-month follow-up, the unaided visual acuity of left eye was 0.02 and corrected visual acuity was 0.2. In addition, there was no recurrence of the endophthalmitis within 1 year of the surgery. Conclusion: The early diagnosis of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis is difficult, and the disease is very likely to be misdiagnosed as uveitis. It is therefore critical to improve awareness of this condition and to reduce the incidence of its misdiagnosis. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most frequent malignancies worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) play critical roles in cancer initiation and progression. Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of cytoskeleton regulator RNA (CYTOR) predicates poor prognosis and promotes tumor progression. However, the functional roles and underlying mechanism of CYTOR in NSCLC remain unknown. In the present study, we found that CYTOR promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion ability, and induced radioresistance in NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, CYTOR could directly interact with miR-195 and increase its targets. Thus, CYTOR played an oncogenic role in NSCLC progression through sponging miR-195. Together, our study elucidates the role of CYTOR as a microRNA sponge in NSCLC, and CYTOR may be used as a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment. © 2018 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a common highly aggressive malignant tumor in worldwide. Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring-finger protein 1 (UHRF1) has a key role in several kinds of cancers development. However, the biology effect of UHRF1 on the tumorigenesis of GC remains unclear. In this research, the role of UHRF1 in the growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in MGC803 and SGC7901 cells. The UHRF1 knockdown MGC803 and SGC7901 cell lines were used to investigate the roles of UHRF1 on GC cell growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis. The growth, migration and invasion rate of UHRF1 knockdown cells was lower than that of the control. Moreover, ROS generation and caspase-3/caspase-9 activities increased in UHRF1 knockdown cells. And mitochondrial membrane potential decreased in UHRF1 knockdown cells. These findings indicated that UHRF1 promoted the growth, migration and invasion of MGC803 and SGC7901 cells and inhibited apoptosis via a ROS-associated pathway. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapies are treatments that use a patient's immune system to combat disease. One important type of immunotherapy employed in cancer treatments is the delivery of monoclonal antibodies to block growth receptors. In this manuscript, we develop a methodology that enables accurate and simple evaluation of antibody-type drug delivery using MALDI-MSI. To overcome the mass-range limitation that prevents the detection of large therapeutic antibodies, we used in situ reduction and alkylation to break disulfide bonds to generate smaller fragments. These smaller fragments are more readily ionized and detected by MALDI-MSI without loss of spatial information on the parent drug. As a proof of concept study, we evaluated the distribution of cetuximab in 3D colon cell cultures. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of epidermal-growth-factor receptor (EGFR), which is often overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and mediates cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Cetuximab directly inhibits tumor growth and metastasis and induces apoptosis. By performing on-tissue reduction followed by MALDI-MSI analysis, we successfully mapped the time-dependent penetration and distribution of cetuximab in spheroids derived from two different colon-cancer cell lines (HT-29 and DLD-1). The localization patterns were further confirmed with IF staining of the drug. Changes in other biomolecules following drug treatment were also observed, including the elevation of ATP in spheroids. The developed method has also been applied to map cetuximab distribution in patient-derived colorectal-tumor organoids (CTOs). Overall, we believe this powerful label-free approach will be useful for visualizing the heterogeneous distribution of antibody drugs in tissues and tumors and will help to monitor and optimize their use in the clinic.

    "Abstract": "Background: Clinical assays for the assessment of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status in breast cancer include immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), both of which have limitations. Recent studies have suggested that a more quantitative approach to the measurement of HER2 protein expression may improve specificity in selecting patients for HER-2 targeted therapy. In the current study, we have used HER2 expression in breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples as a model to explore the potential utility of a novel immunodetection technique, using streptavidin coated Phosphor Integrated Dot fluorescent nanoparticles (PID), which can be quantitatively measured using computer analysis. Methods: The expression of HER2 protein in cell lines was evaluated with antibody-binding capacity using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for comparison with PID measurements to test for correlations with existing quantitative protein analysis methodologies. Various other analytic validation tests were also performed, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, robustness and reproducibility. A methods comparison study investigated correlations between PID versus IHC and ISH in clinical samples. Lastly, we measured HER2 protein expression using PID in the pretreatment biopsies from 34 HER2-positive carcinomas that had undergone neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. Results: In the analytic validation, PID HER2 measurements showed a strong linear correlation with FACS analysis in breast cell lines, and demonstrated significant correlations with all aspects of precision, sensitivity, robustness and reproducibility. PID also showed strong correlations with conventional HER2 testing methodologies (IHC and ISH). In the neoadjuvant study, patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) had a significantly higher PID score compared with patients who did not achieve a pCR (p = 0.011), and was significantly correlated to residual cancer burden (RCB) class (p = 0.026, R 2 = 0.9975). Conclusions: Analytic testing of PID showed that it may be a viable testing methodology that could offer advantages over other experimental or conventional biomarker diagnostic methodologies. Our data also suggests that PID quantitation of HER2 protein may offer an improvement over conventional HER2 testing in the selection of patients who will be the most likely to benefit from HER2-targeted therapy. Further studies with a larger cohort are warranted. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "GTP-binding proteins play important roles in many essential biological processes, including cell signaling, trafficking, and protein synthesis. To assess quantitatively these proteins at the whole proteome level, we developed a high-throughput targeted proteomic method based on the use of isotope-coded GTP probes and multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis. Targeted proteins were labeled with desthiobiotin-GTP probes, digested with trypsin, and the ensuing desthiobiotin-conjugated peptides were enriched with streptavidin beads for LC-MS/MS analysis. We also established a Skyline MRM library based on shotgun proteomic data acquired for 12 different human cell lines. The library contained 605 tryptic peptides derived from 217 GTP-binding proteins, representing approximately 60% of the annotated human GTP-binding proteome. By using this library, in conjunction with isotope-coded GTP probes and scheduled LC-MRM analysis, we investigated the differential expression of GTP-binding proteins in a pair of primary/metastatic colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW620). We were able to quantify 97 GTP-binding proteins, and we further validated the differential expression of several GTP-binding proteins by Western blot analysis. Together, we developed a facile targeted quantitative proteomic method for the high-throughput analysis of GTP-binding proteins and applied the method for probing the altered expression of these proteins involved in colon cancer metastasis.

    "Abstract": "Background: Deregulated inflammation and immune deficit both intricately associate with cancer initiation and progression, which have been increasingly exploited as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Recently, systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) based on peripheral neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts serves as a novel and powerful cancer biomarker with prognostic significance in multiple types of malignancies. Here, we sought to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative SII in patients with primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) after curative resection. Methods: Two independent cohorts with a total number of 309 patients with OSCC from two tertiary referral hospitals were included and defined as training (Nanjing, 138) and validation (Wuxi, 171) cohort, respectively. Preoperative SII in both cohorts was calculated and its optimal cutoff value was initially determined by X-tile software in the training cohort and then verified in the validation cohort. Results: Our data indicated that high SII (≥ 484.5) was significantly associated with larger tumor size (P < 0.05, Chi square test), reduced overall and disease-free survival (Kaplan-Meir, P < 0.05, Log-rank test). Univariate and multivariate analyses further revealed that SII was an independent prognostic predictor for patient survival. Moreover, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of SII for survival was significantly greater or comparable to other well-established prognostic parameters, indicative of its satisfactory prediction accuracy and specificity. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that high preoperative SII associates with poor outcome and serves as a non-invasive, low-cost and powerful prognostic predictor for patients with OSCC. This inflammation/immune-related biomarker holds translational potentials to supplement currently prognostic regime to better stratification of patients and treatment planning. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Organ preserving surgery (OPS) and radiotherapy (RT) are both accepted treatment options for early stage supraglottic cancer (SGC). Radiation has supplanted surgery in most cases, because of the perception that surgery results in poorer functional outcomes. However, evidence suggests that OPS with a neck dissection may be associated with improved survival. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to compare functional outcomes of OPS and RT for early SGC. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify studies. Studies were included if they reported functional outcomes on 10 or more patients with early stage SGC treated with radiation or OPS, including open partial laryngectomy, transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) or transoral robotic surgery (TORS). Two reviewers independently screened articles for relevance using pre-determined criteria. Results: From 7720 references, we included 10 articles (n = 640 patients). 50% (n = 320) of patients were treated with surgery. Three head-to-head RT versus OPS papers were included, however different outcome measures were used for each group. Intractable aspiration management (including total laryngectomy or permanent tracheostomy) following OPS was reported in five papers representing 186 patients; the definitive intractable aspiration management rate was 2.6% (95% CI 1.0-6.8%). Four papers reported permanent G-tube rate for the surgical group (n = 198), calculating a rate of 5.3% (95% CI 2.6-10.5%), this was not reported for the RT group in any papers. One study reported quality of life. Two studies reported objective voice measures. Conclusions: This systematic review revealed a paucity of objective measures and significant data heterogeneity, rendering the comparison of functional outcomes following OPS versus RT for early SGC limited. Future research should include objective measures of functional outcomes including laryngectomy rate, g-tube rate, tracheostomy dependence, quality of life, and voice quality measures. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a resident chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum and a master regulator of the unfolded protein response under physiological and pathological cell stress conditions. GRP78 is overexpressed in many cancers, regulating a variety of signaling pathways associated with tumor initiation, proliferation, adhesion and invasion which contributes to metastatic spread. GRP78 can also regulate cell survival and apoptotic pathways to alter responsiveness to anticancer drugs. Tumors that reside in or metastasize to the bone and bone marrow (BM) space can develop pro-survival signals through their direct adhesive interactions with stromal elements of this niche thereby resisting the cytotoxic effects of drug treatment. In this study, we report a direct correlation between GRP78 and the adhesion molecule N-cadherin (N-cad), known to play a critical role in the adhesive interactions of multiple myeloma and metastatic prostate cancer with the bone microenvironment. Methods: N-cad expression levels (transcription and protein) were evaluated upon siRNA mediated silencing of GRP78 in the MM.1S multiple myeloma and the PC3 metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of GRP78 knockdown (KD) on epithelial-mesenchymal (EMT) transition markers, morphological changes and adhesion of PC3 cells. Results: GRP78 KD led to concomitant downregulation of N-cad in both tumors types. In PC3 cells, GRP78 KD significantly decreased E-cadherin (E-cad) expression likely associated with the induction in TGF-β1 expression. Furthermore, GRP78 KD also triggered drastic changes in PC3 cells morphology and decreased their adhesion to osteoblasts (OSB) dependent, in part, to the reduced N-cad expression. Conclusion: This work implicates GRP78 as a modulator of cell adhesion markers in MM and PCa. Our results may have clinical implications underscoring GRP78 as a potential therapeutic target to reduce the adhesive nature of metastatic tumors to the bone niche. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The role of the dose escalation strategy in brain radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with brain metastases (BMs) has not been identified. This study aims to determine whether an additional radiation boost to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has beneficial effects on overall survival (OS) compared with WBRT-alone. Methods: A total of 82 SCLC patients who were found to have BMs treated with WBRT plus a radiation boost (n = 33) or WBRT-alone (n = 49) from January 2008 to December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were limited-stage (LS) SCLC at the time of the initial diagnosis, and none of them had extracranial metastases prior to detection of BMs. The primary end point was OS. Results: The median OS for all of the patients was 9.6 months and the 6-, 12- and 24-months OS rates were 69.1, 42.2 and 12.8%, respectively. At baseline, the proportion of more than 3 BMs was significantly higher in the WBRT group than in the WBRT plus boost group (p = 0.0001). WBRT plus a radiation boost was significantly associated with improved OS in these patients when compared with WBRT-alone (13.4 vs. 8.5 months; p = 0.004). Further, the survival benefit still remained significant in WBRT plus boost group among patients with 1 to 3 BMs (13.4 vs. 9.6 months; p = 0.022). Conclusion: Compared with WBRT-alone, the use of WBRT plus a radiation boost may prolong survival in SCLC patients with BMs. The dose escalation strategy in brain radiotherapy for selected BMs patients with SCLC should be considered. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Anti-PD-1 mAbs can induce sustained clinical responses in cancer but how they function in vivo remains incompletely understood. Garris et al. show that effective anti-PD-1 immunotherapy requires intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs) producing IL-12. Anti-PD-1 indirectly activates DCs through IFN-γ released from drug-activated T cells. Furthermore, agonizing the non-canonical NF-κB pathway activates DCs and enhances aPD-1 therapy in an IL-12-dependent manner. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.Anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockers can induce sustained clinical responses in cancer but how they function in vivo remains incompletely understood. Here, we combined intravital real-time imaging with single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and mouse models to uncover anti-PD-1 pharmacodynamics directly within tumors. We showed that effective antitumor responses required a subset of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (DCs), which produced interleukin 12 (IL-12). These DCs did not bind anti-PD-1 but produced IL-12 upon sensing interferon γ (IFN-γ) that was released from neighboring T cells. In turn, DC-derived IL-12 stimulated antitumor T cell immunity. These findings suggest that full-fledged activation of antitumor T cells by anti-PD-1 is not direct, but rather involves T cell:DC crosstalk and is licensed by IFN-γ and IL-12. Furthermore, we found that activating the non-canonical NF-κB transcription factor pathway amplified IL-12-producing DCs and sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1 treatment, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to improve responses to checkpoint blockade. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The processes by which tumors evolve are essential to the efficacy of treatment, but quantitative understanding of intratumoral dynamics has been limited. Although intratumoral heterogeneity is common, quantification of evolution is difficult from clinical samples because treatment replicates cannot be performed and because matched serial samples are infrequently available. To circumvent these problems we derived and assayed large sets of human triple-negative breast cancer xenografts and cell cultures from two patients, including 86 xenografts from cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin, docetaxel, or vehicle treatment cohorts as well as 45 related cell cultures. We assayed these samples via exome-seq and/or high-resolution droplet digital PCR, allowing us to distinguish complex therapy-induced selection and drift processes among endogenous cancer subclones with cellularity uncertainty <3%. For one patient, we discovered two predominant subclones that were granularly intermixed in all 48 co-derived xenograft samples. These two subclones exhibited differential chemotherapy sensitivity-when xenografts were treated with cisplatin for 3 weeks, the post-treatment volume change was proportional to the post-treatment ratio of subclones on a xenograft-to-xenograft basis. A subsequent cohort in which xenografts were treated with cisplatin, allowed a drug holiday, then treated a second time continued to exhibit this proportionality. In contrast, xenografts from other treatment cohorts, spatially dissected xenograft fragments, and cell cultures evolved in diverse ways but with substantial population bottlenecks. These results show that ecosystems susceptible to successive retreatment can arise spontaneously in breast cancer in spite of a background of irregular subclonal bottlenecks, and our work provides to our knowledge the first quantification of the population genetics of such a system. Intriguingly, in such an ecosystem the ratio of common subclones is predictive of the state of treatment susceptibility, showing how measurements of subclonal heterogeneity could guide treatment for some patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: It has been demonstrated that bufadienolides exert potent anti-cancer activity in various tumor types. However, the mechanisms that underlie their anti-cancer properties remain unclear. Yes-associated protein, a key effector of Hippo signaling, functions as a transcription coactivator, plays oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles under different conditions. Here, we report that arenobufagin (ABF), a representative bufadienolide, induced breast cancer MCF-7 cells to undergo apoptosis, which occurred through the JNK-mediated multisite phosphorylation of YAP. Methods: Cytotoxicity was examined using an MTT assay. ABF-induced apoptosis was measured with a TUNEL assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and coimmunoprecipitation were employed to assess the expression levels of the indicated molecules. Lose-of-function experiments were carried out with siRNA transfection and pharmacological inhibitors. ABF-induced phosphopeptides were enriched with Ti4 + -IMAC chromatography and further subjected to reverse-phase nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. Results: ABF significantly reduced the viability of MCF-7 cells and increased the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Following ABF treatment, YAP accumulated in the nucleus and bound to p73, which enhanced the transcription of the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and p53AIP1. YAP knock-down significantly attenuated ABF-induced apoptotic cell death. Importantly, we found that the mobility shift of YAP was derived from its phosphorylation at multiple sites, including Tyr357. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis identified 19 potential phosphorylation sites in YAP, with a distribution of 14 phosphoserine and 5 phosphothreonine residues. Furthermore, we found that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 completely diminished the mobility shift of YAP and its phosphorylation at Tyr357, the binding of YAP and p73, the transcription of Bax and p53AIP1 as well as the apoptosis induced by ABF. These data indicate that ABF induced YAP multisite phosphorylation, which was associated with p73 binding, and that apoptosis was mediated by the JNK signaling pathway. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that ABF suppresses MCF-7 breast cancer proliferation by triggering the pro-apoptotic activity of YAP, which is mediated by JNK signaling-induced YAP multisite phosphorylation as well as its association with p73. The present work not only provides additional information on the use of ABF as an anti-breast cancer drug, but also offers evidence that the induction of the tumor suppressor role of YAP may be a therapeutic strategy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Exosomes are nanosized extracellular vesicles (ranging from 30 to 120 nm) released from many cells that provide promising biomarkers for the noninvasive diagnosis of cancer. However, traditional exosome-isolation methods are tedious, nonstandardized, and require bulky instrumentation, thus limiting its clinical applications. In this paper, an anion-exchange (AE)-based isolation method was first proposed to isolate exosomes directly from plasma and cell-culture medium with AE magnetic beads within 30 min. Exosomes isolated with AE magnetic beads had higher recovery efficiency (&gt;90%) and less protein impurities than those isolated by ultracentrifugation (UC). Prostate-cancer (PCa) exosomes in plasma were detected in a visual, label-free, and quantitative manner with aptamer-capped Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles for the first time. The linear range of PCa exosomes was estimated from 0.4 × 10 8 to 6.0 × 10 8 particles/mL with a detection limit of 3.58 × 10 6 particles/mL. The present study provides an efficient and practical approach for the rapid isolation and visible detection of exosomes, which is promising for the early diagnosis of PCa.

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Pediatric desmoid tumor (PDT) is rare and has a high local recurrence rate. The purpose of the present study was to analyze clinical risk factors of local recurrence in PDT patients. Materials and methods: We reviewed clinical data of 66 PDT patients from 2004 to 2015. All patients underwent macroscopically complete resection, and some recurrent tumors were prescribed radiotherapy. Factors such as sex, age at presentation, location, and proximity to nerves or vasculature were analyzed. The local recurrence rate and recurrence-free survival were analyzed with these factors. Results: All patients in the present study were children and had extra-abdominal tumors. The median follow-up time was 6.6 years. Thirty-six (55%) patients had local recurrence. Age, sex, tumor site, tumor size, and proximity to nerves/vasculature had a significant impact on prognosis in univariate analysis. Radiotherapy decreased the local recurrence rate. In multivariate analysis, younger age, tumor location in buttocks, larger tumor, and proximity to important nerves/vasculature were independent risk factors for poor prognosis. Conclusions: Favorable therapeutic strategies could be selected according to the preoperative prognostic risk factors. Radiotherapy should be considered for local recurrence of PDT. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone malignancy prevalent in children and young adults. MicroRNA-133b (miR-133b), through directly targeting the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), is increasingly recognized as a tumor suppressor in different types of cancers. However, little is known on the biological and functional significance of miR-133b/FGFR1 regulation in osteosarcoma. Methods: The expressions of miR-133b and FGFR1 were examined by RT-qPCR and compared between 30 paired normal bone tissues and OS tissues, and also between normal osteoblasts and three OS cells lines, MG-63, U2OS, and SAOS-2. Using U2OS and MG-63 as the model system, the functional significance of miR-133b and FGFR1 was assessed on cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, migration/invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by overexpressing miR-133b and down-regulating FGFR1 expression, respectively. Furthermore, the signaling cascades controlled by miR-133b/FGFR1 were examined. Results: miR-133b was significantly down-regulated while FGFR1 robustly up-regulated in OS tissues and OS cell lines, when compared to normal bone tissues and normal osteoblasts, respectively. Low miR-133b expression and high FGFR1 expression were associated with location of the malignant lesion, advanced clinical stage, and distant metastasis. FGFR1 was a direct target of miR-133b. Overexpressing miRNA-133b or knocking down FGFR1 significantly reduced the viability, proliferation, migration/invasion, and EMT, but promoted apoptosis of both MG-63 and U2OS cells. Both the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt intracellular signaling cascades were inhibited in response to overexpressing miRNA-133b or knocking down FGFR1 in OS cells. Conclusion: miR-133b, by targeting FGFR1, presents a plethora of tumor suppressor activities in OS cells.

    "Abstract": "Background: There is increasing evidence indicating an aberrant expression of miRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Growing evidence has suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could modulate the remodeling of the epigenome. No study has yet been published to examine the direct effect of PUFA on the promoter methylation of miRNAs. This study aimed to examine the potential clinical application of PUFA on the promoter DNA methylation of miR-126 and its angiogenic target molecule (VEGF) in the CRC cells. Methods: We investigated the direct effect of 100 μM EPA, DHA, and LA for 24 h on promoter methylation status of miR-126 in a panel of five CRC cell lines (HCT116, HT29/219, Caco2, SW742, and LS180) by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). We also quantified the miR-126 and VEGF transcript expression levels in five CRC cell lines affected by PUFA by real-time PCR. Moreover, we analyzed the protein expression level of VEGF, as a target of miR-126, by western blotting assay. Results: MSP analysis showed extensive DNA methylation of the miR-126 promoter in all five CRC cell lines, and among all three PUFAs, only DHA completely demethylated the promoter of miR-126 in HCT116 and Caco2 cell lines. We found that only DHA significantly induces the expression level of miR-126 in HCT116 and Caco2 cell lines, respectively, by 20.1-fold and 1.68-fold (p < 0.05). Our finding indicates that the downregulation of VEGF protein level is also effectively observed only in DHA-treated HCT116 and Caco2 cells compared to control cells (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that n-3 PUFAs are able to modulate cellular miR-126 DNA methylation and inhibit VEGF expression level in a cell-type specific manner in colorectal cancer cells. DHA always showed higher efficacy than EPA and LA in our experiment. Overall, our results suggest a potential clinical application of n-3 PUFAs as anti-angiogenic agents in CRC therapy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) proteogenomic analysis prioritized dihydropyrimidinase-like-3 (DPYSL3) as a multilevel (RNA/protein/phosphoprotein) expression outlier specific to the claudin-low (CLOW) subset of triple-negative breast cancers. A PubMed informatics tool indicated a paucity of data in the context of breast cancer, which further prioritized DPYSL3 for study. DPYSL3 knockdown in DPYSL3-positive (DPYSL3 + ) CLOW cell lines demonstrated reduced proliferation, yet enhanced motility and increased expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, suggesting that DPYSL3 is a multifunctional signaling modulator. Slower proliferation in DPYSL3-negative (DPYSL3 − ) CLOW cells was associated with accumulation of multinucleated cells, indicating a mitotic defect that was associated with a collapse of the vimentin microfilament network and increased vimentin phosphorylation. DPYSL3 also suppressed the expression of EMT regulators SNAIL and TWIST and opposed p21 activated kinase 2 (PAK2)-dependent migration. However, these EMT regulators in turn induce DPYSL3 expression, suggesting that DPYSL3 participates in negative feedback on EMT.

    "Abstract": "The adjuvant effects of flagellin on regulation of immune response have been proved; whether flagellin could assist tumor cell lysate (TCL) to enhance anti-glioma immunity remains to be investigated. This study tests a hypothesis that therapeuticly intracranial administration with flagellin plus TCL enhances the effects of specific immunotherapy on glioma in mice. In this study, GL261 cells were transferred into C57BL/6 mice and the GL261-bearing mice were subcutaneously or intracranially inoculated with flagellin plus TCL, flagellin, TCL or saline. Our results showed that prophylacticly subcutaneous administration with TCL and flagellin could induce potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and prolong the survival of GL261-bearing mice significantly, but therapeuticly subcutaneous administration failed to. However, therapeuticly intracranial administration of TCL plus flagellin could prolong the survival. Moreover, intracranial administration of flagellin could recruit CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells to brain tissues, induce proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and induce to splenomegaly. The results suggested that flagellin could be acted as an efficient adjuvant for TCL based vaccine. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "AIM To investigate the expression of hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, integrin β1, and Ki-67 in colorectal cancer and to analyze their effect on the prognosis of this malignancy. METHODS One hundred and sixty-two tumor specimens of colorectal cancer patients treated in Jinhua Hospital of Jinhua University were collected, and immunohistochemical staining was used to determine the expression of hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, integrin β1, and Ki-67 in the specimens. The results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS Among 162 specimens, 36 were found to have missing expression of hMLH1, hMSH2, and hMSH6, with a deletion rate of 22.22%. The expression of MMR protein was significantly associated with tumor diameter (P = 0.0005), Dukes stage (P = 0.0248), family history of tumor (P = 0.0042), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0014). The positive expression of integrin β1 was significantly associated with Dukes stage (P = 0.0002), and the positive expression of Ki-67 was significantly associated with Dukes stage (P = 0.0002) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0111). Loss of MMR protein expression and positive expression of integrin β1 and Ki-67 were significantly associated with Dukes stage (P = 0.006) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.023). The 5-year survival rate was 88.89% in the deficient mismatch repair group and 59.52% in the proficient mismatch repair group, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0010). The 5-year survival rate was significantly lower in the integrin β1 positive group than in the integrin β1 negative group (59.69% vs 90.91%, P = 0.0007). The 5-year survival rate was also significantly lower in the Ki-67 positive group than in the Ki-67 negative group (63.27% vs 93.33%, P = 0.0192). CONCLUSION The expression of MMR protein, integrin β1, and Ki-67 is statistically correlated with Dukes stage and lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer, and all the three factors are related to the prognosis of patients: loss of MMR protein expression and negative expression of integrin β1 and Ki-67 are associated with better prognosis and higher 5-year survival rate. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "We isolated a strain of human mycoplasma that promotes lymphomagenesis in SCID mice, pointing to a p53-dependent mechanism similar to lymphomagenesis in uninfected p53 − / − SCID mice. Additionally, mycoplasma infection in vitro reduces p53 activity. Immunoprecipitation of p53 in mycoplasma-infected cells identified several mycoplasma proteins, including DnaK, a member of the Hsp70 chaperon family. We focused on DnaK because of its ability to interact with proteins. We demonstrate that mycoplasma DnaK interacts with and reduces the activities of human proteins involved in critical cellular pathways, including DNA-PK and PARP1, which are required for efficient DNA repair, and binds to USP10 (a key p53 regulator), impairing p53-dependent anticancer functions. This also reduced the efficacy of anticancer drugs that depend on p53 to exert their effect. mycoplasma was detected early in the infected mice, but only low copy numbers of mycoplasma DnaK DNA sequences were found in some primary and secondary tumors, pointing toward a hit-and-run/hide mechanism of transformation. Uninfected bystander cells took up exogenous DnaK, suggesting a possible paracrine function in promoting malignant transformation, over and above cells infected with the mycoplasma. Phylogenetic amino acid analysis shows that other bacteria associated with human cancers have similar DnaKs, consistent with a common mechanism of cellular transformation mediated through disruption of DNA-repair mechanisms, as well as p53 dysregulation, that also results in cancer-drug resistance. This suggests that the oncogenic properties of certain bacteria are DnaK-mediated. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All Rights Reserved.",

    "Abstract": "On cell-membrane surfaces, receptor-protein dimers play fundamental roles in many signaling pathways that are crucial for normal biological processes and cancer development. Efficient and sensitive analysis of receptor dimers in the native environment is highly desirable. Herein, we present a strategy for amplified imaging of receptor dimers in zebrafish and living cells that relies on aptamer recognition and proximity-induced hybridization chain reaction. Taking advantage of specific aptamer recognition and enzyme-free signal amplification, this strategy is successfully applied to the visualization of c-Met-receptor dimers in an HGF-independent or -dependent manner. Therefore, the developed imaging strategy paves the way for further investigation of the dimerization or oligomerization states of cell-surface receptors and their corresponding activation processes in zebrafish and living cells.

    "Abstract": "Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized treatment and improved survival in many cancers. However, since immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are potentially fatal, early recognition and prompt treatment are warranted. One of the rarest but most dramatic irAE is myocarditis, which has significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and treated early. Objective: To report the first case of myocarditis in a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with a combination of nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody, and PROSTVAC, a vector-based therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine. Case Report: A 79-year-old man with mCRPC metastatic to bone and lymph nodes and a history of atrial fibrillation presented with blurred vision and pain and stiffness in the upper back after 8 weeks on a clinical trial with nivolumab (1 mg/kg) and PROSTVAC, both given every 2 weeks. Eye exam was within normal limits, while musculoskeletal exam revealed tenderness in trapezius muscles and decreased motor strength in arms (III/V) and neck (IV/V). The rest of the physical exam was within normal limits, with the exception of an irregular heart rhythm. Laboratory tests were as follows: creatinine kinase (CK) 3200 U/L (normal: 39-308 U/L), CK-MB 65.7 mcg/L (normal: 0-7.6 mcg/L), troponin I 0.209 ng/mL (normal: 0-0.056 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation with QT prolongation (QTc 514 msec) and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from baseline. 2D-echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65% with an enlarged left atrium, dilated right ventricle, and increased pulmonary artery pressure (45 mmHg). ProBNP was elevated at 1463 pg/mL and peaked at 3066 pg/mL one day after hydration. With a presumed diagnosis of autoimmune myositis and possible myocarditis, the patient was admitted and started on methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day. Cardiac MRI showed elevated native myocardial T1 values consistent with myocarditis (Fig. 1). The patient was discharged on a prednisone taper after normalization of cardiac enzymes on day 4. Treatment with PROSTVAC continued for three more months; nivolumab was discontinued. Six months later, patient is doing well, with no residual cardiac damage. Discussion: Cardiovascular irAEs are relatively rare (< 1%) and have a variety of clinical presentations. Myocarditis is potentially life-threatening and can range from subclinical to fulminant. Therefore, clinical suspicion, early detection, and prompt treatment are imperative (1). The initial diagnostic workup should include cardiac enzymes, ECG, and 2D-echocardiogram. The most commonly observed ECG changes are generalized repolarization abnormalities, prolonged QT interval, and conduction abnormalities (2). An elevated troponin I in the absence of overt coronary artery disease is suggestive of myocarditis and should be evaluated further. Myocardial biopsy is the standard diagnostic procedure; however, a cardiac MRI can achieve a diagnosis when biopsy is not feasible (3). Advancements in parametric mapping techniques have allowed the use of native myocardial T1 in the detection of myocarditis, as it has superior diagnostic performance and higher sensitivity than older parameters (3). Our patient had been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a therapeutic cancer vaccine to induce effective antitumor activity through immunogenic intensification and presented with muscle stiffness and elevated CK. Although he had no new cardiovascular symptoms, cardiac enzymes were tested to rule out myocardial involvement. MRI with gadolinium confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. To date, none of the 1360 patients treated with PROSTVAC as a single agent have developed myocarditis, while myocarditis has been rarely reported in patients treated with nivolumab (< 1%) (1). Whether the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab presents an additional risk of myocarditis is unclear. To our knowledge, this is the first case of myocarditis in a patient with mCRPC receiving simultaneous treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a prostate cancer vaccine. Our experience highlights the importance of suspicion and early intervention in patients who present with cardiac abnormalities after receiving cancer immunotherapy. We propose following protocol: baseline troponin, ECG, and 2D-echocardiogram prior to treatment, then repeated troponin at 2, 4, and 12 weeks post-treatment, then monthly. If troponin becomes positive without alternative explanation, myocarditis should be ruled out with cardiac MRI or myocardial biopsy, and patient should be admitted for treatment with high-dose steroids as early intervention may minimize myocardial injury. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AIM To investigate the role of miR-133 in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer (GC) cells, and to explore the underlying mechanism. METHODS The expression of miR-133 and JAK2 mRNA in tissues and cells was detected by qRT-PCR. AGS and MGC-803 cells were transfected with miR-133 mimic (miR-133 group), miR-133 inhibitor (miR-133 inhibitor group), nonspecific inhibitor (inhibitor-NC group), psiCHECK2-JAK2-3 UTR WT vector and miR-133 mimic (JAK2 WT group), psiCHECK2-JAK2-3 UTR MUT vector and miR-133 mimic (JAK2 MUT group), miR-133 mimic and JAK2 (miR-133 + JAK2 group), or miR-133 mimic and pc-DNA 3.1 (miR-133 + vector group) using a liposome-mediated method. Untransfected cells (miR-NC group) were also included as a control. The protein expression of JAK2 was detected by Western blot. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. Cell migration and invasion were detected by Transwell assay. The luciferase activity was detected by double luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS Compared with human paracancerous tissues or normal gastric mucosal cells (GES-1), miR-133 was down-regulated in GC tissues and GC cells (AGS and MGC-803), and JAK2 was highly expressed in GC tissues and AGS and MGC-803 cells (P < 0.05). Overexpression of miR-133 or silencing JAK2 could inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC cells. JAK2 is a target of miR-133, and JAK2 could rescue the inhibitory effect of miR-133 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC cells. CONCLUSION MiR-133 could inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells via mechanisms possibly related to targeting of JAK2, which will provide a new target for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of GC. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "Background: Effective interventions to promote human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination are needed, particularly among populations at increased risk of HPV-related disease. We developed and pilot tested a web-based intervention, Outsmart HPV, to promote HPV vaccination among young gay and bisexual men (YGBM). Methods: In 2016, we recruited a national sample (n = 150) of YGBM ages 18–25 in the United States who had not received any doses of HPV vaccine. Participants were randomized to receive either standard HPV vaccination information (control) or population-targeted, individually-tailored content (Outsmart HPV intervention). We assessed between group differences in HPV vaccination attitudes and beliefs immediately following the intervention using multiple linear regression. Results: There were no differences in HPV vaccination attitudes, beliefs and intentions between groups at baseline. Compared to participants in the control group, intervention participants reported: greater perception that men who have sex with men are at higher risk for anal cancer relative to other men (b = 0.34); greater HPV vaccination self-efficacy (b = 0.15); and fewer perceived harms of HPV vaccine (b = −0.34) on posttest surveys (all p <.05). Overall, intervention participants reported high levels of acceptability and satisfaction with the Outsmart HPV intervention (all > 4.4 on a 5-point scale). Conclusions: Findings from this study provide preliminary support for a brief, tailored web-based intervention in improving HPV vaccination attitudes and beliefs among YGBM. An important next step is to determine the effects of Outsmart HPV on HPV vaccine uptake. Clinical trials registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02835755. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "AIM To evaluate the clinical efficacy of intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy for patients with gastric cancer (GC) peritoneal metastasis and its impact on immune function and prognosis. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of 113 patients with GC treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between June 2010 and March 2013. The patients were randomly divided into an observation group (54 cases) and a control group (59 cases). Patients in the control group were treated with conventional intravenous chemotherapy, and patients in the observation group were treated with intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy. The clinical efficacy, related indicators of recurrence and metastasis, tumor markers, T-lymphocyte subsets, quality of life, and occurrence of adverse reactions after chemotherapy was compared between the two groups of patients. RESULTS The total effective rate and disease control rate in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The levels of serum carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), CA724, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). After treatment, serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), osteopontin (OPN), soluble apoptotic factor (sFas), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels were significantly lower in the observation group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and B cells in the peripheral blood were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group, while CD8+ T cells and NK cells were significantly lower than those of the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The improvement of KPS score after treatment, the recurrence rate at 2 years, the 3-year survival rate, and the 5-year survival rate were significantly better in the observation group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions after chemotherapy was not statistically different between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION Peritoneal hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy can improve clinical efficacy, tumor markers and related indicators of recurrence and metastasis, as well as the patient’s immune function and quality of life of patients with GC peritoneal metastasis, without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "Background: Broad copy number aberrations (BCNAs) represent a common form of genome instability in colorectal cancer (CRC). CRCs show large variations in their level of aneuploidy: microsatellite-instable (MSI) tumors are known to have a near-diploid karyotype while microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors show high level of chromosomal instability. However, MSS tumors have great heterogeneity in the number of BCNAs, with a minor percentage of samples showing an almost normal karyotype. In the present work we subdivided MSS CRCs according to a \"BCNA score\" and characterized their transcriptome profiles, considered as a proxy to their phenotypic features. Methods: Microsatellite testing, genome-wide DNA copy number and whole-transcript expression analysis (HTA) were performed on 33 tumor samples and 25 normal colonic tissue samples from 32 CRC patients. 15.1% of the samples were MSI tumors (n = 5), whereas 84.9% were MSS tumors (n = 28). Gene expression data of 34 additional MSI tumors was retrieved from a public functional genomics data repository. Results: Using as a threshold the first quartile of the BCNA score distribution, MSS samples were classified as low-BCNA (LB, n = 7) or high-BCNA (HB, n = 21). LB tumors were enriched for mucinous CRCs and their gene-expression profile resembled that of MSI samples for what concerns a subset of genes involved in secretory processes, mucosal protection, and extracellular matrix remodeling. HB tumors were predominantly non-mucinous adenocarcinomas and showed overexpression of a subset of genes typical of surface colonocytes and EGF signaling. A large percentage of unclassified samples according to the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) classifier was found in the LB group (43%), whereas 76% HB tumors belonged to CMS2. Conclusions: A classification of colorectal tumors based on the number of BCNAs identifies two groups of MSS tumors which differ for histopathology and gene expression profile.

    "Abstract": "Simultaneous blockade of immune checkpoint molecules and co-stimulation of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) is predicted to improve overall survival in human cancer. TNFRSF co-stimulation depends upon coordinated antigen recognition through the T cell receptor followed by homotrimerization of the TNFRSF, and is most effective when these functions occur simultaneously. To address this mechanism, we developed a two-sided human fusion protein incorporating the extracellular domains (ECD) of PD-1 and OX40L, adjoined by a central Fc domain, termed PD1-Fc-OX40L. The PD-1 end of the fusion protein binds PD-L1 and PD-L2 with affinities of 2.08 and 1.76 nM, respectively, and the OX40L end binds OX40 with an affinity of 246 pM. High binding affinity on both sides of the construct translated to potent stimulation of OX40 signaling and PD1:PD-L1/L2 blockade, in multiple in vitro assays, including improved potency as compared to pembrolizumab, nivolumab, tavolixizumab and combinations of those antibodies. Furthermore, when activated human T cells were co-cultured with PD-L1 positive human tumor cells, PD1-Fc-OX40L was observed to concentrate to the immune synapse, which enhanced proliferation of T cells and production of IL-2, IFNγ and TNFα, and led to efficient killing of tumor cells. The therapeutic activity of PD1-Fc-OX40L in established murine tumors was significantly superior to either PD1 blocking, OX40 agonist, or combination antibody therapy; and required CD4+ T cells for maximum response. Importantly, all agonist functions of PD1-Fc-OX40L are independent of Fc receptor cross-linking. Collectively, these data demonstrate a highly potent fusion protein that is part of a platform, capable of providing checkpoint blockade and TNFRSF costimulation in a single molecule, which uniquely localizes TNFRSF costimulation to checkpoint ligand positive tumor cells. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Nanogel-based systems loaded with single anticancer drugs display miscellaneous effectiveness in tumor remission, gradually circumventing mutation and resistance in chemotherapy. Hence, the existence of dual-drug delivered nano-sized systems has been contemporaneous with drug development and preceded the conventional-dose chemotherapy. Among outstanding synergistic drug nanoplatforms, thermosensitive copolymer heparin-Pluronic F127 (Hep-F127) co-delivering cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumins (Cur) (Hep-F127/CDDP/Cur) has emerged as a notable candidate for temperature-responsive drug delivery. The procedure was based on the entrapment of curcumin into the hydrophobic core of bio-degradable co-polymer Hep-F127 while the hydrophilic drug CDDP subsequently conjugated to the backbone heparin to form the core-shell structure. The copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), to corroborate the successful synthesis and via HPLC along with AES-ICP to evaluate the high drug loading along with a controllable release from the nano-gels. A well-defined nano-shell with size in the 129.3 ± 3.8 nm size range could enhance higher the efficacy of the conjugated-CDDP to Hep-F127 than that of single doses. Moreover, the considerable amount of dual-drug released from thermosensitive nanogels between different conditions (pH = 7.4 and pH = 5.5) in comparison to CDDP from Hep-F127 partially indicated the significantly anti-proliferative ability of Hep-F127/CDDP/Cur to the MCF-7 cell line. Remarkably, drug testing in a xenograft model elucidates the intricate synergism of co-delivery in suppressing tumor growth, which remedies some of the problems affecting in cancer chemotherapy. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "There is increasing interest in using alpha particle emitting radionuclides for cancer therapy because of their unique cytotoxic properties which are advantageous for eradicating tumor cells. The high linear energy transfer (LET) of alpha particles produces a correspondingly high density of ionizations along their track. Alpha particle emitting radiopharmaceuticals deposit this energy in tissues over prolonged periods with complex dose rate patterns that depend on the physical half-life of the radionuclide, and the biological uptake and clearance half-times in tumor and normal tissues. We have previously shown that the dose rate increase half-time that arises as a consequence of these biokinetics can have a profound effect on the radiotoxicity of low-LET radiation. The microcontroller hardware and software described here offer a unique way to deliver these complex dose rate patterns with a broad-beam alpha particle irradiator, thereby enabling experiments to study the radiobiology of complex dose rate patterns of alpha particles. Complex dose rate patterns were created by precise manipulation of the timing of opening and closing of the electromechanical shutters of an α-particle irradiator. An Arduino Uno and custom circuitry was implemented to control the shutters. The software that controls the circuits and shutters has a user-friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI). Alpha particle detectors were used to validate the programmed dose rate profiles. Circuit diagrams and downloadable software are provided to facilitate adoption of this technology by other radiobiology laboratories. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",

    "Abstract": "Using single-cell RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry, Henry et al. create a cellular anatomy of the normal human prostate and provide the tools to identify, isolate, and localize every cell type. They identify two additional epithelial cell types enriched in the prostatic urethra and proximal prostatic ducts. © 2018 The Author(s)A comprehensive cellular anatomy of normal human prostate is essential for solving the cellular origins of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. The tools used to analyze the contribution of individual cell types are not robust. We provide a cellular atlas of the young adult human prostate and prostatic urethra using an iterative process of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry on ∼98,000 cells taken from different anatomical regions. Immunohistochemistry with newly derived cell type-specific markers revealed the distribution of each epithelial and stromal cell type on whole mounts, revising our understanding of zonal anatomy. Based on discovered cell surface markers, flow cytometry antibody panels were designed to improve the purification of each cell type, with each gate confirmed by scRNA-seq. The molecular classification, anatomical distribution, and purification tools for each cell type in the human prostate create a powerful resource for experimental design in human prostate disease. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "The number of leukocytes present in circulation varies throughout the day, reflecting bone marrow output and emigration from blood into tissues. Using an organism-wide circadian screening approach, we detected oscillations in pro-migratory factors that were distinct for specific vascular beds and individual leukocyte subsets. This rhythmic molecular signature governed time-of-day-dependent homing behavior of leukocyte subsets to specific organs. Ablation of BMAL1, a transcription factor central to circadian clock function, in endothelial cells or leukocyte subsets demonstrated that rhythmic recruitment is dependent on both microenvironmental and cell-autonomous oscillations. These oscillatory patterns defined leukocyte trafficking in both homeostasis and inflammation and determined detectable tumor burden in blood cancer models. Rhythms in the expression of pro-migratory factors and migration capacities were preserved in human primary leukocytes. The definition of spatial and temporal expression profiles of pro-migratory factors guiding leukocyte migration patterns to organs provides a resource for the further study of the impact of circadian rhythms in immunity. © 2018 The Author(s)Leukocytes continuously circulate throughout the body. He et al. demonstrate that trafficking patterns of major leukocyte subsets occur in a rhythmic manner dependent on the time-of-day-dependent expression of lineage- and tissue-specific factors. This influences the inflammatory response and leukemic tumor burden and translates to the migration behavior of human primary lymphocytes. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Exosomal surface glycans play important roles in microvesicle protein sorting and exosome-cell interactions, and also provide promising biomarkers for various diseases. However, in situ detection techniques for exosomal glycans are largely lacking. In this work, an exosomal array is fabricated for probing cancer-related exosomal glycan signatures by lectin recognition-mediated in situ rolling circle assembly of fluorophore-labeled DNA. Different from commonly used lectin array, the proposed strategy enables the direct and amplified conversion of glycan recognition signals to fluorescence detection signals. Focusing on tumor-associated glycans including sialic acids, fucose and truncated O-glycans, the method has been used not only to compare glycan patterns between exosomes with different origins, but also to reveal the specific exosomal glycan characteristics compared to their parent cells. The limits of detection were identified to be 5.4 × 10 6 and 1.3 × 10 6 particles mL −1 for HeLa and PANC-1 exosomes, respectively. The dynamic ranges were 4.7 × 10 5 to 4.7 × 10 8 , 4.7 × 10 8 to 4.7 × 10 9 for HeLa exosomes, and 4.7 × 10 5 to 1.2 × 10 9 , 1.2 × 10 9 to 4.7 × 10 9 particles mL −1 for PANC-1 exosomes. The remodeling of exosomal glycans can also be monitored as demonstrated on the cleavage of sialic acids under sialidase treatment. It could be anticipated that this strategy would become a powerful tool for development of exosome-based glyco-biomarkers and elucidation of biological significance of exosomal glycans. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) facilitate tumor progression via establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). However, it is poorly understood how tumor cells could functionally modulate TAMs. Our previous work indicated that tumor cell-released autophagosomes (TRAPs), a type of LC3-II + double-membrane extracellular vesicles (EVs) was sufficient to suppress anti-tumor immune responses by inducing IL-10-producing B cells and immune suppressive neutrophils. Here, we hypothesized that TRAPs may participate in regulating macrophage polarization. Methods: TRAPs isolated from multiple murine tumor cell lines and pleural effusions or ascites of cancer patients were incubated with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and monocytes, respectively. Cellular phenotypes were examined by flow cytometry, ELISA and quantitative PCR. TRAPs treated BMDMs were tested for the ability to suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro, and for promotion of tumor growth in vivo. Transwell chamber and neutralization antibodies were added to ascertain the inhibitory molecules expressed on BMDMs exposed to TRAPs. Knockout mice were used to identify the receptors responsible for TRAPs-induced BMDMs polarization and the signaling mechanism was examined by western blot. Autophagy-deficient tumors were profiled for phenotypic changes of TAMs and IFN-γ secretion of T cells by flow cytometry. The phenotype of monocytes from pleural effusions or ascites of cancer patients was assessed by flow cytometry. Results: TRAPs converted macrophages into an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype characterized by the expression of PD-L1 and IL-10. These macrophages inhibited the proliferation of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in vitro, and promoted tumor growth mainly through PD-L1 in vivo. TRAPs-induced macrophage polarization was dependent on TLR4-mediated MyD88-p38-STAT3 signaling. In vivo studies indicated that disruption of autophagosome formation in B16F10 cells by silencing the autophagy gene Beclin1 resulted in a remarkable delay in tumor growth, which was associated with reduced autophagosome secretion, TAMs reprogramming and enhanced T cell activation. Moreover, the levels of LC3B + EVs appeared to correlate significantly with up-regulation of PD-L1 and IL-10 in matched monocytes from effusions or ascites of cancer patients, and TRAPs isolated from these samples could also polarize monocytes to an M2-like phenotype with increased expression of PD-L1, CD163 and IL-10, decreased expression of HLA-DR, and T cell-suppressive function. Conclusions: These findings suggest the TRAPs-PD-L1 axis as a major driver of immunosuppression in the TME by eliciting macrophage polarization towards an M2-like phenotype, and highlight the potential novel therapeutic approach of simultaneously targeting autophagy and PD-L1. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Despite the fact that progress has been made in the application of supramolecular prodrug self-assemblies to enhance the functionality of drug-delivery systems, corresponding research on multi-responsive supramolecular prodrug self-assemblies for programmed drug delivery is still limited. In this paper, the synthesis and self-assembly behavior of supramolecular prodrug complexes (SPCs) with β-cyclodextrin–acylhydrazone–doxorubicin (β-CD-hydrazone-DOX) and the targeting of azobenzene-terminated poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (Azo-PDMA-FA) as a building block were investigated. The obtained SPCs could also form self-assemblies on the basis of their amphiphilic nature. Next, SPC-based multi-compartment vesicles and complex micelles, which were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic/static light scattering, were obtained with good reversibility under alternative visible light or UV irradiation. Furthermore, three-stage programmed drug-delivery behavior was observed from dual-responsive SPC-based self-assemblies by utilizing UV and pH stimuli. Specifically, the SPCs first self-assembled into multicompartmental vesicles, which was accompanied by a slow release of DOX. Next, UV-light irradiation induced the dissociation of β-CD/Azo, which led to morphology transition and a slight increase in the rate of release of DOX. Upon transferring the self-assemblies to phosphate-buffer solution (pH 5.0), the release rates increased notably as a result of the broken acylhydrazone bond. Finally, basic cell experiments further demonstrated that the SPC-based self-assemblies could be internalized into cancer cells, which suggests their promise for applications in cancer therapy. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "The role of nanoparticles in cancer medicine is vast with debate still surrounding the distinction between therapeutic efficacy of actively targeted nanoparticles versus passively targeted systems for drug delivery. While it is commonly accepted that methodologies that result in homing a high concentration of drug loaded nanoparticles to the tumor is beneficial, the role of intracellular trafficking of these nanoparticles in dictating the overall therapeutic outcome remains unresolved. Herein we demonstrate that the therapeutic outcome of drug loaded nanoparticles is governed beyond simply enabling nanoparticle internalization in cells. Using two model polymeric nanoparticles, one decorated with the GE11 peptide for active targeting of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the other without, we demonstrate that EGFR mediated intracellular internalization results in an enhanced therapeutic effect compared to the nontargeted formulation. Our findings demonstrate that the intracellular destination of nanoparticles beyond its ability to internalize is an important parameter that has to be accounted for in the design of targeted drug delivery systems. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "We report the synthesis of eco-friendly fluorescent nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) using the renewable resource of Phyllanthus emblica juice as a precursor by the hydrothermal process at 200 °C for 12 h. The synthesized NCDs emitted bright fluorescence without any pretreatment of the sample under the excitation of UV light and exhibited excitation-dependent fluorescence emission. The NCDs have nitrogen-containing and oxygen-containing functional groups such as amino, hydroxyl, and carboxyl on the surface of the carbon structure. Furthermore, the NCDs exhibited excellent water dispersibility with prolonging stability and good biocompatibility. On the basis of the good optical properties, the NCDs have potentially been used as a promising staining agent on HCT-116 human colon cancer cells and Caenorhabditis elegans (nematodes) for multicolor cellular imaging. In the cell cytoplasm, the NCDs showed rapid uptake and high cytocompatibility on cellular morphology with bright fluorescence emission. Furthermore, the NCDs were used as fluorescent ink for writing and drawing with anticoagulation. In addition, the NCDs were significantly utilized as a fluorescent ink for thumb impression, which glows instantly under the illumination of UV light and does not require a secondary treatment. Hence, the synthesized NCDs can be used as ideal multicolor fluorescent probes for bioimaging applications and as fluorescent ink instead of traditional fluorescent ink. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The profiling of disease-related biomarkers is an essential procedure for the accurate diagnosis and intervention of metabolic disorders. Therefore, the development of ultrasensitive and highly selective fluorogenic biosensors for diverse biomarkers is extremely desirable. There is still a considerable challenge to prepare nanocluster-based fluorescence turn-on probes capable of recognizing multiple biomolecules. We herein provide a novel nanocluster-based chemical information processing system (CIPS) for the programmable detection of various metabolites and enzymes. This CIPS consists of biocatalytic reactions between substrates and their respective oxidases to generate H 2 O 2 , which was then employed to synthesize bright fluorescent silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs). Utilizing this system, we are able to accurately probe a series of substrates/corresponding oxidases with high sensitivity and specificity, including glucose/glucose oxidase, uric acid/uric acid oxidase, sarcosine/sarcosine oxidase, choline/choline oxidase, xanthine/xanthine oxidase, and lactic acid/lactic acid oxidase. Furthermore, this metabolite profiling CIPS can be integrated with binary logic operations, which create an intelligent tool for the high-throughput screening of various diseases in vitro (e.g., diabetes, gout, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, and lactic acidosis).

    "Abstract": "Li et al. have characterized a small-molecule cyclopeptide, astin C, which specifically inhibits cGAS-STING signaling as well as the innate inflammatory responses. This finding provides a way to potentially manipulate STING-mediated clinical diseases. © 2018 The Author(s)cGAS-STING signaling is essential for innate immunity. Its misregulation promotes cancer or autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, and it is imperative to identify effective lead compounds that specifically downregulate the pathway. We report here that astin C, a cyclopeptide isolated from the medicinal plant Aster tataricus, inhibits cGAS-STING signaling and the innate inflammatory responses triggered by cytosolic DNAs. Moreover, mice treated with astin C are more susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Consistently, astin C markedly attenuates the autoinflammatory responses in Trex1 −/− BMDM cells and in Trex1 −/− mouse autoimmune disease model. Mechanistically, astin C specifically blocks the recruitment of IRF3 onto the STING signalosome. Collectively, this study characterizes a STING-specific small-molecular inhibitor that may be applied for potentially manipulating the STING-mediated clinical diseases. © 2018 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic antineoplastic drugs (ADs), widely used in treating cancer, are considered hazardous in the workplace and thus require safe handling practices. An analytical protocol for environmental and biological AD monitoring in the healthcare environment has been developed, since Europe lacks clear guidelines and regulations for cytostatic preparation and handling. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for measuring contemporaneously 20 multi-class cytostatic compounds and urinary α-fluoro-β-alanine, whereas platinum was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Sampling procedures and analytical conditions were optimized and the assays were validated. Environmental AD monitoring data, collected in 2009-2017, for a total of 3749 wipe tests and 57 720 determinations, was evaluated. RESULTS: The proportion of positive samples gradually decreased from 11.7% in 2010 to 1% in 2017, however, 2266 determinations were positive. No urine sample had detectable concentrations of any of the 4 drugs considered (0/398 samples). CONCLUSIONS: These improvements are so large that the key role played by the new, more stringent rules for preparing and administering ADs is evident. Hence, the analytical method involving multi-element determinations allows for a more thorough and complete investigation into the AD contamination of work environments. Med Pr 2018;69(6):589-604.
