    "Abstract": "Three water-soluble Cu(Ⅱ)-based acylhydrazone porphyrin derivatives (named as CuP1, CuP2 and CuP3) were prepared and isolated successfully. Diversiform physicochemical approaches demonstrated that all of the complexes possess excellent binding affinity with ct-DNA, especially CuP3 exhibited strongest binding affinity than its analogues. Moreover, the antiproliferative properties of all compounds in vitro in human cancer cell line (A549 and H-1975 lung cancer cells, HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma, T47D breast cancer cells) and noncancerous cell line (Hs 578Bst normal breast cells) have also been evaluated by MTT assay. Besides, an extracted method was carried out to determine the cellular uptake ability of three complexes to the tested cancer cell lines. The cytotoxicity and cellular uptake tests revealed that CuP3 exhibited the best antiproliferative activity as well as cellular absorption capacity towards H-1975 cell line. In order to better understand the effects of CuP3 on H-1975 cells, the fluorescence microscopy measurements were employed, the cell membrane damage, nuclear condensation, and apoptotic bodies (brighter fluorescence) were markedly observed after incubated with CuP3 for 48 h, suggesting that CuP3 can induce cell apoptosis on H-1975 cells significantly. In addition, the flow cytometric analysis results illustrated that the complex CuP3 mainly caused an accumulation of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence has indicated that long noncoding RNA NEAT1 exerts critical roles in cancers. So far, the detailed biological role and mechanisms of NEAT1, which are responsible for human gastric cancer (GC), are still largely unknown. Here, we observed that NEAT1 and STAT3 expressions were significantly upregulated in human GC cells including BGC823, SGC-7901, AGS, MGC803, and MKN28 cells compared with normal gastric epithelial cells GES-1, while miR-506 was downregulated. We inhibited NEAT1 and observed that NEAT1 inhibition was able to repress the growth, migration, and invasion of GC cells. Conversely, overexpression of NEAT1 exhibited an increased ability of GC progression in BGC823 and SGC-7901 cells. Bioinformatics analysis, dual luciferase reporter assays, RIP assays, and RNA pull-down tests validated the negative binding correlation between NEAT1 and miR-506. In addition, it was found that miR-506 can modulate the expression of NEAT1 in vitro. STAT3 was predicted as a messenger RNA (mRNA) target of miR-506, and miR-506 mimics can suppress STAT3 mRNA expression. Subsequently, it was observed that downregulation of NEAT1 can restrain GC development by decreasing STAT3, which can be reversed by miR-506 inhibitors. Therefore, it was hypothesized in our study that NEAT1 can be recognized as a competing endogenous RNA to modulate STAT3 by sponging miR-506 in GC. In conclusion, we implied that NEAT1 can serve as an important biomarker in GC diagnosis and treatment. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: HOX genes encode transcription factors that play key roles in modulating normal tissue morphogenesis, differentiation and homeostasis. Disruption of normal HOX gene expression occurs frequently in human cancers and is associated with both tumor promoting and suppressing activities. Among these is, HOXA10, a pleiotropic gene that is critical for normal prostate development. In this study we characterized HOXA10 expression in human and mouse PCa to gain insights into its clinical significance. Methods: A meta-analysis of HOXA10 mRNA expression was carried out across several publicly available data sets. Expression of HOXA10 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using human radical prostatectomy (RP) cases. We correlated HOXA10 expression to clinicopathological features and investigated its relationship to biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP by the Kaplan-Meier method. HOXA10 mRNA and IHC protein expression was also examined in a mouse model of Pten-null PCa. Results: A meta-analysis of HOXA10 gene expression indicated dysregulated expression of HOXA10 in human PCa. IHC profiling of HOXA10 revealed inverse correlations between HOXA10 expression and Gleason pattern, Gleason score, and pathological stage (P < 0.01). Patients with low expression profiles of HOXA10 were associated with a higher risk of BCR, (OR, 3.54; 95%CI, 1.21-16.14; P = 0.049) whereas patients with high HOXA10 expression experienced longer times to BCR (P = 0.045). However, HOXA10 was not an independent predictor of BCR (OR, 1.52; 95%CI, 0.42-5.54; P = 0.52). Evaluation of expression patterns of HOXA10 in mouse prostate tumors mimicked that of humans. Conclusions: Our findings show that HOXA10 expression is inversely associated with tumor differentiation and high HOXA10 expression is associated with improved BCR-free survival. This study provides human and mouse evidence to suggest tumor suppressive roles for HOXA10 in the context of prostate cancer. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a high-performance biosensing nanoplatform based on amidoxime-modified polyacrylonitrile nanofibers decorated with Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs-PAN-oxime NFs) is described. The AgNPs-PAN-oxime NFs were prepared by the combination of electrospinning technique and chemical modification of nitrile group in the PAN. The proposed signal amplifiying nanoplatform was applied in the fabrication of an electrochemical aptasensor for the sensitive detection of CA 125 based on aptamer-cDNA duplex and target induced strand displacement recognition mechanism. The aptasensing interface offers high sensitivity and selectivity for detection of tumor marker due to inherent advantages such as high specific surface area of NFs, good conductivity by doping AgNPs into the polymer NFs and especially the ideal selectivity of anti CA 125 aptamer to its target. The electrochemical aptasensor revealed a wide dynamic linear range (DLR) from 0.01 to 350 U mL−1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.991 and limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0042 U mL−1. Additionally, the designed aptasensor showed acceptable selectivity, reproducibility, repeatability and stability. The satisfactory results for determination of CA 125 in serum samples compared to ELISA method (p-value &gt; 0.05) indicated the potential application of aptasensor in clinical monitoring of tumor biomarker for early diagnosis and management of ovarian cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: Atypical protein kinase C-ι (aPKC-ι) is an oncogenic factor, and required for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of different types of cancer. Our study aimed to investigate the role of aPKC-ι in the EMT, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Methods: Expression of aPKC-ι was evaluated in CRC cell lines treated with TGF-β1 using qPCR and western blot. After aPKC-ι was knocked down using shRNA, migration and invasion abilities of CRC cell lines were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. Activation status of downstream signaling factors of aPKC-ι including Rac1, JNK, STAT3 and β-catenin, was measured using western blot. Furthermore, auranofin, an aPKC-ι inhibitor, was used to treat CRC cell lines to investigate its possible inhibition on the EMT of CRC cell lines, as well as on the expression of aPKC-ι and its downstream signaling factors. Results: TGF-β1 induced the expression of aPKC-ι in CRC cells, and knockdown on aPKC-ι inhibited the TGF-β1-induced EMT, migration and invasion of CRC cells. Interestingly, Rac1 GTPase level was decreased when aPKC-ι was knocked down, and overexpression of Rac1G12V rescued the cell EMT, migration and invasion in CRC cells as inhibited by sh-aPKC-ι. Moreover, knockdown on aPKC-ι suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK and STAT3, and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. The aPKC- ι inhibitor, Auranofin, showed similar inhibitory effects as aPKC-ι knockdown. Conclusion: Knockdown on aPKC-ι inhibited the EMT, migration and invasion of CRC cells through suppressing of Rac1-JNK pathway. Those findings indicate that aPKC-ι may serve as a novel therapeutic target for CRC. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate objectively the effectiveness of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for the prevention of acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) by using biophysical skin measurements. Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 120 breast cancer patients who underwent an identical radiotherapy (RT) regimen post-lumpectomy was performed (TRANSDERMIS trial). Patients were randomized to receive PBM (808 nm CW/905 nm pulsed, 168 mW/cm 2 , spot size 19.6 cm 2 , fluence 4 J/cm 2 ) or placebo treatments from the first day of RT (2×/week). Biophysical skin measurements were collected to assess the skin pigmentation and barrier function. Measurements were collected at the first day of RT, a RT dose of 40 Gray (Gy), and the end of RT (66 Gy). Results: The incidence of moist desquamation was significantly higher in the control than in the PBMT group at the end of RT (30 vs. 7%, respectively, odds ratio = 6, p = 0.004). The biophysical skin measures showed that the mean percentage change from the baseline transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, and melanin values was significantly higher in the control than in the PBMT group at the end of RT (ps &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk on moist desquamation was significantly increased for patients with a large (&gt; 800 cc) breast volume (odds ratio = 4, p = 0.017). Conclusions: This is the first randomized controlled trial demonstrating by objective measurements that PBMT is effective in reducing the incidence of moist desquamation in breast cancer patients undergoing RT. Additionally, a large breast volume is an important risk factor for the development of moist desquamation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Adiponectin (Acrp30) plays an important role in energy metabolism and inflammation. Recently, in vivo serum Acrp30 levels have been reported to be correlated to risk of developing several types of cancers such as lung cancer, and in vitro studies have demonstrated a role for Acrp30 in the control of cell proliferation and survival. However, the molecular effects of Acrp30 on lung cancer have not yet been clearly defined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of different concentrations of Acrp30 on the A549 human alveolar epithelial cell line, an in vitro model of lung adenocarcinoma. A549 cells were exposed to various concentrations of Acrp30 and successively, proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative stress were evaluated by MTT test, caspase activity assay, flow-cytometry and western blotting analysis. Our results demonstrated that Acrp30 causes, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, a reduction of cell viability and duplication together with an increase in cell apoptosis rate. In addition, we found that Acrp30 induces an increase of lipid peroxidation evaluated by TBARS assay and a concomitant reduction of nitric oxide release, both markers of cellular oxidative stress. Taken together, our data on A549 cells provides new insight into potential involvement of Acrp30 on physio-pathologic mechanisms of lung diseases through interference with proliferation, apoptosis and oxidative status. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Glucarpidase, also known as carboxypeptidase G 2 , is a Food and Drug Administration-approved enzyme used in targeted cancer strategies such as antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT). It is also used in drug detoxification when cancer patients have excessive levels of the anti-cancer agent methotrexate. The application of glucarpidase is limited by its potential immunogenicity and limited catalytic efficiency. To overcome these pitfalls, mutagenesis was applied to the glucarpidase gene of Pseudomonas sp. strain RS-16 to isolate three novels “biobetter” variants with higher specific enzyme activity. DNA sequence analysis of the genes for the variants showed that each had a single point mutation, resulting in the amino acid substitutions: I100 T, G123S and T239 A. K m, V max and K cat measurements confirmed that each variant had increased catalytic efficiency relative to wild type glucarpidase. Additionally, circular dichroism studies indicated that they had a higher alpha-helical content relative to the wild type enzyme. However, three different software packages predicted that they had reduced protein stability, which is consistent with having higher activities as a tradeoff. The novel glucarpidase variants presented in this work could pave the way for more efficient drug detoxification and might allow dose escalation during chemotherapy. They also have the potential to increase the efficiency of ADEPT and to reduce the number of treatment cycles, thereby reducing the risk that patients will develop antibodies to glucarpidase. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a common malignancy which is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women all over the worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the roles of miR-1469 in the development of BC, as well as its regulatory mechanism. The expression levels of miR-1469 in BC tissues, serum, and cell lines were determined. Effects of overexpression of miR-1469 on MCF7 cell viability, colony-forming ability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were then investigated. Furthermore, the potential target of miR-1469 in MCF7 cells was explored. Besides, the association between miR-1469, PTEN/PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways was elucidated. Notably, confirmatory experiments by downregulation of miR-1469 in SK-BR-3 cells were further performed. The miR-1469 expression was significantly downregulated in BC tissues, serum, and cell lines. The overexpression of miR-1469 significantly inhibited the proliferation, arrested cell-cycle at G2/M phase, increased apoptosis, suppressed migration, and invasion of MCF-7 cells. In addition, HOXA1 was verified as a direct target of miR-1469, and the effects of overexpression of miR-1469 on the malignant behaviors of MCF7 cells were significantly counteracted by overexpression of HOXA1 concurrently. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-1469 suppressed the activation of PTEN/PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which was reversed overexpression of HOXA1 concurrently. Besides, confirmatory experiments showed that the inhibition of miR-1469 promoted the malignant behaviors of SK-BR-3 cells, which was inversed after miR-1469 inhibition and HOXA1 knockdown at the same time. Our findings reveal that downregulation of miR-1469 may promote the development of BC by targeting HOXA1 and activating PTEN/PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. MiR-1469 may serve as a promising target for BC therapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Metal-based coordination compounds, including the well-known cytostatic drug cisplatin, are widely used in the anticancer therapy. Generally, they exhibit high cytotoxicity not only towards malignant cells, but also towards non-malignant cells, which represents main problem of their clinical use. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and biological testing of three trinuclear nickel(II) coordination compounds. Central nickel atoms are bridged by trithiocyanurate anion and coordinated by triamine and bis-benzimidazoles, respectively. To delineate a potential usage in anticancer therapy, we encapsulated the most cytotoxic complex into biomacromolecular protein cage apoferritin (FRT), forming FRTNi. FRT encapsulation markedly decreased the hemotoxicity of free Ni compounds. Despite FRTNi can be internalized through passive targeting by enhanced permeability and retention effect, we further introduced active targeting utilizing folate receptor (FR) via folic acid (FA)-modified FRT (FRTNiFA). Using breast cancer cell lines T-47D (FR+), MCF-7 (FR-) and non-malignant mammary gland derived cell line HBL-100 (FR-), we show pronounced FR-dependent internalization of FRTNiFA. Overall, we demonstrate that the FRT macromolecular nanocarrier provides a very low off-target toxicity, which could enable the use of highly toxic Ni compounds in cancer nanomedicine. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Following our research for human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH) inhibitors as anticancer agents, herein we describe 3D QSAR-based design, synthesis and in vitro screening of 2-,4,-6-, and/or 7-substituted quinoline derivatives as hDHODH inhibitors and anticancer agents. We have designed 2-,4,-6-, and/or 7-substituted quinoline derivatives and predicted their hDHODH inhibitory activity based on 3D QSAR study on 45 substituted quinoline derivatives as hDHODH inhibitors, and also predicted toxicity. Designed compounds were docked into the binding site of hDHODH. Designed compounds which showed good predictive activity, no toxicity, and good docking score were selected for the synthesis, and in vitro screening as hDHODH inhibitors in an enzyme inhibition assay, and anticancer agents in MTT assay against cancer cell lines (HT-29 and MDA-MB-231). Synthesized compounds 7 and 14 demonstrated IC 50 value of 1.56 µM and 1.22 µM, against hDHODH, respectively, and these are our lead compounds for the development of new hDHODH inhibitors and anticancer agents. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in the world, with multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations involved in disease development. CYLD tumor suppressor gene encodes a multifunctional deubiquitinase which negatively regulates various signaling pathways. Deregulation of this gene has been found in different types of cancer. This study aimed to evaluate for the first time the CpG island methylation pattern of CYLD gene promoter, and its expression level in gastric adenocarcinoma. CYLD messenger RNA expression and promoter methylation in 53 tumoral and their non-neoplastic counterpart tissues were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing. Also, we investigated the impacts of the infectious agents including Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), EBV, and CMV on CYLD expression and promoter methylation in GC. Results showed that the expression level of CYLD was downregulated in GC, and was significantly associated with gender (female), patient’s age (<60), high grade, and no lymph-node metastasis (p = 0.001, 0.002, 0.03, and 0.003, respectively). Among the 31 analyzed CpG sites located in about 600 bp region within the promoter, two CpG sites were hypermethylated in GC tissues. We also found a significant inverse association between DNA promoter methylation and CYLD expression (p = 0.02). Furthermore, a direct association between H. pylori, EBV, and CMV infections with hypermethylation and reduced CYLD expression was observed (p = 0.04, 0.03, and 0.03, respectively). Our findings indicate that CYLD is downregulated in GC. Infectious agents may influence CYLD expression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The detection of oral Human Papillomavirus (HPV) may be of clinical utility because of the major role HPV plays in the etiology of oropharyngeal cancer. However, oral HPV testing is not standardized and the best sampling method has yet to be identified. We aimed to compare HPV findings in matched oral rinse-and-gargles (rinses), oropharyngeal brushings and oral brushings. Materials and methods: HPV-DNA was investigated using Linear Array in samples collected from cancer-free individuals at increased risk for oral HPV. Results: 163 oral rinses already tested for HPV were selected. The matched oropharyngeal (n = 163) and oral brushings (n = 100) were analyzed. The detection rate for any HPV, high-risk (HR)-HPVs and HPV16 was significantly higher in rinses than brushings. The overall agreement for any HPV between rinses and oropharyngeal brushings was 51.2% (Cohen K: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.07–0.21). The proportion of positive agreement was 16.8%. The overall agreement for HR-HPVs was 74.1% (Cohen K: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.07–0.33). The genotype-specific profile of rinses and brushings which were concomitantly HPV-positive only partially overlapped in cases with multiple infections, with more genotypes detected in the rinse, which were not isolated in the corresponding brushings. Conclusion: The agreement for HPV status between rinses and brushings is poor, particularly for the HPV-positive findings. Despite the fact that the origin of the HPV-infected cells present in the oral rinse is unclear, since they could not be traced back to the oropharynx or oral cavity, oral rinses provided the highest detection rate for HR-HPVs and HPV16. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies worldwide. Although mortality rates have been decreasing, the prognosis of CRC patients is still highly dependent on the individual. Therefore, identifying and understanding novel biomarkers for CRC prognosis remains crucial. The gene expression profiles of five-gene expression omnibus (GEO) data sets of CRC were first downloaded. A total of 352 consistent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for CRC and paired with normal tissues. Functional analysis including gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment revealed that these DEGs were related to metabolic pathways, tight junctions, and the cell cycle. Ten hub DEGs were identified based on the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes database and protein–protein interaction networks. By using univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we found 11 survival-related genes among these DEGs. We finally established a five-gene signature (kinesin family member 15, N-acetyltransferase 2, glutathione peroxidase 3, secretogranin II, and chloride channel accessory 1) with prognostic value in CRC by step multivariate Cox regression analysis. Based on this risk scoring system, patients in the high-risk group had significantly poorer survival results compared with those in the low-risk group (log-rank test, p < 0.0001). Finally, we validated our gene signature scoring system in two independent GEO cohorts (GSE17536 and GSE33113). We found all five of the signature genes to be DEGs in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. In conclusion, our findings suggest that our five DEG-based signature can provide a novel biomarker with useful applications in CRC prognosis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a heterogeneous disease which has an unpredictable risk of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The selection of patients who may benefit from early radical intervention is a challenge. To define the useful prognostic markers for progression, we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), Her2/neu, and E2F1 in 60 cases of NMIBC who underwent TURBT and adjuvant intravesical bacillus-Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Their predicting role for tumor recurrence, progression, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed. High FASN expression was observed in 56.7% (34/60) of NMIBC cases, and FASN expression was significantly associated with the tumor size, grade, and tumor stage (p = 0.003, p < 0.001, p < 0.0001 respectively). Positive Her2/neu was noted in 18.3% (11/60) of the cases, and its expression was significantly associated with the tumor size, histologic grade, and tumor stage (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.011 respectively). High E2F1 expression was detected in 40% of the cases, and it was associated with tumor size, histologic grade, and tumor stage (p < 0.001 for each). Analysis of follow-up period revealed that NMIBC with high FASN, positive Her2/neu, and high E2F1 expression exhibited a potent relation with tumor progression, shorter RFS, and poor PFS. Conclusions: High FASN, Her2/neu, and E2F1 are considered as adverse prognostic factors of tumor recurrence and progression in NMIBC and these patients should be followed carefully. Therefore, we suggest that FASN, Her2/neu, and E2F1 should be considered and evaluated during the selection of the appropriate management strategy for NMIBC patients. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has attracted more attention compared with other breast cancer subtypes due to its aggressive nature, poor prognosis, and chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment with no other approved targeted therapy. Therefore, the study aimed to discover more promising therapeutic targets and investigating new insights of biological mechanism of TNBC. Six microarray data sets consisting of 463 non-TNBC and 405 TNBC samples were mined from Gene Expression Omnibus. The data sets were integrated by meta-analysis and identified 1075 differentially expressed genes. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed which consists of 486 nodes and 1932 edges, where 29 hub genes were obtained with high topological measures. Further, 16 features (hub genes), 12 upregulated (AURKB, CCNB2, CDC20, DDX18, EGFR, ENO1, MYC, NUP88, PLK1, PML, POLR2F, and SKP2) and four downregulated (CCND1, GLI3, SKP1, and TGFB3) were selected through machine learning correlation based feature selection method on training data set. A naïve Bayes based classifier built using the expression profiles of 16 features (hub genes) accurately and reliably classify TNBC from non-TNBC samples in the validation test data set with a receiver operating curve of 0.93 to 0.98. Subsequently, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the hub genes were enriched in mitotic cell cycle processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that they were enriched in cell cycle pathways. Thus, the identified key hub genes and pathways highlighted in the study would enhance the understanding of molecular mechanism of TNBC which may serve as potential therapeutic target. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Twenty-two novel indole-vinyl sulfone derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as tubulin polymerization inhibitors. The physicochemical and drug-likeness properties of all target compounds were predicted by Osiris calculations. All compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activities, among them, compound 7f exhibited the most potent activity against a panel of cancer cell lines, which was 2–7 folds more potent than our previously reported compound 4. Especially, 7f displayed about 8-fold improvement of selective index as compared with compound 4, indicating that 7f might have lower toxicity. Besides, 7f inhibited the microtubule polymerization by binding to the colchicine site of tubulin. Further investigations showed that compound 7f effectively disrupted microtubule network, caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induced cell apoptosis in K562 cells. Moreover, 7f reduced the cell migration and disrupted capillary-like tube formation in HUVEC cells. Importantly, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of 7f was validated in H22 liver cancer xenograft mouse model without apparent toxicity, suggesting that 7f is a promising anti-tubulin agent for cancer therapy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: There are no conclusive results concerning changes in scapular kinematics associated with upper limb dysfunctions after breast cancer surgery. Objective: To compare the three-dimensional (3-D) scapular kinematics during elevation of the arm between women after breast cancer surgery and controls. Shoulder range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, pain intensity, upper limb function, and quality of life were also assessed. Methods: Forty-two women were assigned to two groups (surgery group, n = 21; control group, n = 21). 3-D scapular kinematics was collected during elevation of the arm in the scapular plane. ROM was assessed using a digital inclinometer, muscle strength using a manual dynamometer, pain with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), upper limb function with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and quality of life with the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF36). Results: The surgery group presented decreased scapular upward rotation at 120° of arm elevation in the scapular plane (p <.05; d = −0.88), decreased shoulder external rotation ROM and strength of shoulder abduction and external rotation when the affected side was compared to the non-affected side and control group. Moreover, the surgery group also reported higher pain, increased upper limb disability and poorer quality of life compared with healthy controls. Conclusion: Scapular upward rotation seems to be decreased at 120° of arm elevation in women following breast cancer surgery. In addition, shoulder external rotation ROM, abduction strength, external rotation strength, function, and quality of life are also impaired in these women. They also experienced pain during the studied movements. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "To analyze the possible clonal origin of a part of Synchronous colorectal cancer (SCRC), we studied 104 paired-SCRCs from 52 consecutive patients without hereditary forms of CRC. We used a Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism array to characterize the genomic profiles, and subsequently used a statistical application to define them according to clonality within the same individual. We categorized the ensuing groups according to colonic location to identify differential phenotypes. The SCRC Monoclonal group (M) (19 cases) was divided into Monosegmental (MM) and Pancolonic (MP) groups. The SCRC Polyclonal group (P) (33 cases) was also divided into Monosegmental (PM) and Pancolonic (PP), the first exhibiting preference for left colon. The MM group showed a high rate of mucinous tumors, the lowest mean-number of tumors and associated-polyps, and the worst prognosis. The MP group included the largest mean-number of associated-polyps, best prognosis and familial cancer component. The PM group seemed to be a “frontier” group. Finally, the PP group also exhibited a mucin component, the highest mean-number of tumors (4.6) compared with the mean-number of polyps (7.7), poor prognosis and sporadic cases. Most relevant differential genomic regions within M groups were gains on 1q24 and 8q24, and deletions on 1p21 and 1p23 for MM, while within P were the gains on 7q36 and deletions on 1p36 for PM. The statistical application employed seems to define clonality more accurately in SCRC -more likely to be polyclonal in origin-, and together with the tumor locations, helped us to configure a classification with prognostic and clinical value. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "The eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage classification (TNM) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was launched. It remains unknown if incorporation of nonanatomic factors into the stage classification would better predict survival. We prospectively recruited 518 patients with nonmetastatic NPC treated with radical intensity-modulated radiation therapy ± chemotherapy based on the eighth edition TNM. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) incorporating pretreatment plasma Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) DNA derived new stage groups. Multivariable analyses to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) derived another set of stage groups. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were: Stage I (PFS 100%, OS 90%, CSS 100%), II (PFS 88%, OS 84%, CSS 95%), III (PFS 84%, OS 84%, CSS 90%) and IVA (PFS 71%, OS 75%, CSS 80%) (p < 0.001, p = 0.066 and p = 0.002, respectively). RPA derived four new stages: RPA-I (T1–T4 N0–N2 & EBV DNA <500 copies per mL; PFS 94%, OS 89%, CSS 96%), RPA-II (T1–T4 N0–N2 & EBV DNA ≥500 copies per mL; PFS 80%, OS 83%, CSS 89%), RPA-III (T1–T2 N3; PFS 64%, OS 83%, CSS 83%) and RPA-IVA (T3–T4 N3; PFS 63%, OS 60% and CSS 68%) (all with p < 0.001). AHR using covariate adjustment also yielded a valid classification (I: T1–T2 N0–N2; II: T3–T4 N0–N2 or T1–T2 N3 and III: T3–T4 N3) (all with p < 0.001). However, RPA stages better predicted survival for PS and CSS after bootstrapping replications. Our RPA-based stage groups revealed better survival prediction compared to the eighth edition TNM and the AHR stage groups. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Seven new chalcones, lanceolein A–G (compounds 5 and 7–12), as well as five known chalcones (1–4 and 6), were isolated from the methanolic extract of Coreopsis lanceolata flowers. The chemical structures of 5 and 7–12 were determined on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. All compounds inhibited the production of nitrite oxide (NO) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Also, compounds 1–6 showed moderated cytotoxicity against human colon cancer cell lines, while compounds 7–12 hardly showed the cytotoxicity. Especially, compounds 2, 5, and 6 exhibited a little higher cytotoxicity on HCT15 cells, with IC 50 values of 43.7 ± 2.17 μM, 35.6 ± 0.24 μM, and 47.9 ± 1.18 μM, respectively. In the Tali assay, compounds 2 and 5 increased the numeral of apoptotic cells. These compounds also significantly promoted the expression of apoptotic proteins including PARP and caspase-3. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Evidence suggests recent improvements in outcome in early breast cancer (EBC). Aim: To analyse recurrence in women with EBC from our region from 1997 to 2015. Methods: We analysed recurrence in 3,765 women with EBC. Median follow up was 83·0 months. 62·5% had a symptomatic presentation. 81·8% were hormone receptor positive and 38·5% were node positive. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was present in 24·3%. Of the 2,686 women entered from 2002 onwards tested for HER2 status, 72·7% had a luminal tumour, 15·2% had a HER2+ tumour and 12·1% had a triple negative (TN) tumour. Results: Recurrence occurred in 459 (12·2%), predominantly in distant sites (71·7%). In women entered from 2002 onwards, the five and 10 year recurrence rates were significantly lower in the luminal group than the HER2+ and the TN groups. Few recurrences occurred in HER2+ and TN cancers after 36 months. On multivariate analysis the following were associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrence: nodal involvement (p < 0·0001), tumour grade (p < 0·0001), symptomatic presentation (p < 0·0001), presence of LVI (p = 0·001), non-luminal tumour type (p < 0·0001) and tumour size >50 mm (p = 0·02). Conclusion: The recurrence rate in this series was much lower than in previous older series. Lymph node involvement, tumour grade, symptomatic presentation, presence of LVI, non-luminal tumour type and tumour size (>50 mm) were associated with an increased risk of recurrence. We strongly recommend that clinicians include the presence of LVI and symptomatic presentation as well as the other established tumour factors, when assessing the risk of recurrence in women with EBC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The current treatment approaches for esophageal cancer are associated with poor survival, and there are ongoing efforts to find new and more effective therapeutic strategies. There are several reports on the antitumoral effects of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs). We have assessed the possible survival benefit of LMWHs in esophageal malignancies. This was a randomized, single-blind, multicenter, Phase II clinical trial on nonmetastatic esophageal cancer candidate for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to the chemoradiotherapy-only arm or chemoradiotherapy plus enoxaparin arm using 1:1 allocation. Radiotherapy was delivered in 1.8-Gy daily fractions to a dose of 50.4 Gy in both groups. Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 and carboplatin (AUC 2) were administered weekly, concurrent with radiotherapy. In the intervention group, patients received enoxaparin (40 mg) and chemoradiation daily. 4–6 weeks after treatment, all patients underwent esophagectomy. After a median follow up of 7 months, estimated 1 year disease-free survival (DFS) in the intervention group was 78.9% and was 70% in the control groups (p = 0.5). Toxicity from the experimental treatment was minimal, and there were no treatment-related deaths. A pathologically complete response in intervention and control group was 64.8% and 62.5%, respectively (p = 0.9). There was a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival by the addition of enoxaparin to the concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen. However, 1 y DFS of both groups were high as expected. A longer follow-up and a larger sample size are required. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Bacillus species are known to cause severe infection in immunocompromised hosts. The incidence of Bacillus bloodstream infections and characteristics of infection among children with cancer or indication for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is unknown. Methods: We performed a retrospective medical record review of all cases of Bacillus bacteremia between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, at Boston Children's Hospital. We report average incidences from 2012 to 2014. We performed a detailed review of infections among children with cancer or undergoing HCT and a case–control study to evaluate whether neutropenia at diagnosis caries higher risk of Bacillus infection for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Results: One hundred fourteen children developed Bacillus bacteremia during the study period, with an estimated incidence of 0.27/1,000 patients. Among children treated for cancer or undergoing HCT, there were 37 bloodstream infections (2.0/1,000 patients). Of the 37 oncology/HCT patients, oncologic diagnoses included ALL (18), acute myeloid leukemia (3), myelodysplastic syndrome (1), solid tumors (8), and 7 children were undergoing HCT. The incidence of infection among children with ALL was 34/1,000 patients and all central nervous system (CNS) infections (6) and deaths (3) occurred in this population. Neutropenia at time of diagnosis in children with ALL was not associated with risk of infection (P = 0.17). Discussion: We report the first hospital-wide analysis of Bacillus infection and found that immunocompromised children experience a significant proportion of Bacillus infections. Children with ALL have a high incidence of infection and are at higher risk of CNS involvement and death. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "These last years, significant progress has been made in the design of strategies empowering T cells with efficient anti-tumor activities. Hence, adoptive T cell therapy and the use of monoclonal antibodies against the immunosuppressive surface molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1 appear as the most promising immunotherapies against cancer. One of the challenges ahead is to render these therapeutic interventions even more effective as a still elevated fraction of cancer patients is refractory to these treatments. A frequently overlooked determinant of the success of T cell-based immunotherapy relates to the ability of effector T cells to migrate into and within tumors, as well as to have access to tumor antigens. Here, we will focus on recent advances in understanding T cell trafficking into and within tumors. Both chemoattractant molecules and structural determinants are essential for regulating T cell motile behavior along with cellular interactions-mediated antigen recognition. In addition, we will review evidence that the microenvironment of advanced tumors creates multiple obstacles limiting T cells from migrating and making contact with their malignant targets. We will particularly focus on the extracellular matrix and tumor-associated macrophages that make tumors a hostile environment for T cell ability to contact and kill malignant cells. Finally, we will discuss possible strategies to restore a tumor microenvironment more favorable to T cell migration and functions with a special emphasis on approaches targeting the dysregulated extracellular matrix of growing tumors. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "The hazardous air pollutants like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are considered as toxic because of their role in ozone formation and adverse effects on human health. Owing to this, the present study was carried out at six spatially distributed sites in Delhi from November 2017- June 2018. Activated charcoal tubes were used to collect samples of BTEX and were further analyzed using GC-FID. The minimum BTEX concentration was found at institutional site (9.94 μg/m 3 ) and maximum at roadside site (103.12 μg/m 3 ) with the average of 46.66 μg/m 3 . Also, the levels of BTEX were 1.18–1.74 times higher during rush hours as compared to non-rush hours. The high T/B ratio (2.26–3.41) observed is the indication of the traffic-originated sources of emission. The cancer risks calculated for benzene at probability 0.50 ranged as 1.29E-06 – 1.80E-05, whereas 4.09E-06 – 3.40E-05 at probability 0.95, which were higher than the acceptable value of 1.0E-06. The non-cancer health risks in terms of hazard index were observed less than unity i.e. within acceptable limit. The total ozone formation potential (OFP) was obtained as 207.51 ± 123.40 μg/m 3 with maximum potential by toluene. Such high levels of BTEX, cancer risks and OFP obtained in the study especially at roadside and connectivity hub are harmful for people residing near these areas, and also to large commuters, who are exposed to such emissions during travelling. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Sinomenine (SIN) is an anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic alkaloid derived from Sinomenium acutum, and the product Zhengqing Fengtongning produced from SIN has been marketed in China for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Interestingly, we recently found that SIN could significantly ameliorate bone destruction induced by breast cancer cells in mice. Micro-CT examination showed that bone loss of the trabecular bones in tumor-bearing mice was markedly decreased by i.p. treatment of SIN at 150 mg/kg body weight. A mechanistic study demonstrated that SIN could suppress osteoclast formation and bone absorption induced by both MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-231 cell-conditioned medium (MDA-MB-231 CM) in preosteoclastic RAW264.7 cells. The MDA-MB-231 CM-induced osteoclast-related genes TRAP and OSCAR were obviously downregulated by SIN. In addition, mRNA expression of c-Fos and NFATc1 and nuclear translocation of c-Fos and NFATc1 protein were inhibited by SIN during MDA-MB-231 CM-induced osteoclastogenesis, while NF-κB signaling was not impacted by SIN. More interestingly, SIN was demonstrated to decrease hIL-8 mRNA expression in cultured MDA-MB-231 cells and to inhibit hIL-8 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells cocultured with preosteoclastic RAW264.7 cells while simultaneously downregulating CXCR1, the ligand of IL-8 related to bone destruction, during MDA-MB-231 CM-induced osteoclastogenesis. Previously, IL-8/CXCR1 was reported to be associated with the pathogenesis and progression of RA, and SIN was observed to markedly ameliorate bone erosion of RA patients. Our current findings may extend the utilization of SIN to preventing osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in breast cancer patients and may enable IL-8/CXCR1 to serve as new targets for both anticancer and antiarthritic drug discovery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: The use of preoperative breast MRI remains controversial despite being the most sensitive technique for the detection of breast malignancies. Purpose: To evaluate the benefit of preoperative breast MRI after performing the three conventional techniques (DM, US, DBT). To analyze the influence of breast density in the sensitivity of the different imaging techniques. Material and methods: Retrospective review of 280 histologically confirmed breast cancers in 192 women. We reviewed the medical records and evaluated the change of treatment induced by MRI. Also, we assessed the reports of DM and the combination of the different imaging techniques, and categorized them according to ACR density (a–d) and as negative (BI-RADS 1-3) or positive (BIRADS 4 or 5). The gold standard was the pathologic assessment of the surgical specimen. The sensitivity of the different techniques was compared using McNemar test. Results: Among these 192 women the use of MRI did not significantly increase the mastectomy rate (from 16.6% to 17.6%; p = 0.5). The addition of any technique demonstrated a higher sensitivity than DM alone. The sensitivity of DM alone was 52.5% while using all the techniques, including MRI, was 94.3% (p < 0.001). Regardless of breast density pattern, the addition of any technique significantly increased the sensitivity of DM (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The addition of MRI to the three conventional techniques increased the sensitivity but did not significantly modify the rate of mastectomies. Additional techniques increased the sensitivity of DM in both dense and non-dense breasts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Bladder cancer (BCa) is the most common malignant tumor in the urinary system. Growing evidence suggests that as a tumor suppressor gene, hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) is correlated with various malignancies in the modulation of tumor progression. This study aims to investigate the effect of HIC1 on regulating the proliferation, migration, and invasion of BCa. Methods: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot (WB) were used to evaluate the expression of HIC1 messenger RNA and protein in human BCa tissues and cells. Proliferation, migration and invasion assays, and flow cytometry assay were performed to assess the biological functional role of HIC1 in BCa. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) examined the protein-protein interaction. The signaling pathways involved in the mode of action of HIC1 in BCa were also investigated. Results: HIC1 was found downregulated in tested samples. Cloning formation assay and cell-proliferation activity analysis showed that overexpression of HIC1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of BCa cells, while knockdown led to the opposite, namely the promotion of the proliferation. Flow cytometry assay confirmed the arrest of the cell cycle at the G1 phase with overexpression of HIC1 observed. Moreover, HIC1 inhibited migration and invasion of BCa. Co-IP showed the binding between YAP (yes-associated protein) and TEAD (TEA domain/transcription enhancer factor family members) as well as the cancerostatic activity of HIC1, partially manifested via its negative regulation of YAP signaling pathway. Conclusions: Our data unprecedently showed that HIC1 was responsible for the inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion of BCa via the YAP signaling pathway. These findings suggested that therapeutic strategies regulating HIC1 expression might provide effective treatments for BCa. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the prognostic significance of lymphovascular space invasion (LVI) and perineural invasion (PNI) in rectal cancer. Methods and materials: Clinical data of 1,232 stage II–III rectal cancer patients from six tertiary institutions were analyzed. All patients were treated by long-course preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was performed for 962 (78.1%) patients according to the multidisciplinary team's decision. Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors were evaluated according to the lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and perineural invasion (PNI) status. Results: Five-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates of the entire cohort were 84.1% and 71.1%, respectively. There is a significant difference in 5-year OS among both-absent, LVI+ only, PNI+ only, and both-present groups (89.1% vs. 77.9% vs. 67.6% vs. 56.2%; p < 0.001). RFS at five years was significantly different among both-absent, LVI+ only, PNI+ only, and both-present groups (78.7% vs. 58.7% vs. 44.6% vs. 38.6%; p < 0.001). The 5-year distant failure-free survival (DFFS) rate was also significantly different among four groups (84.6% vs. 61.4% vs. 54.2% vs 48.6%; p < 0.001). Although adjuvant chemotherapy did not affect 5-year DFFS in the entire cohort, adjuvant chemotherapy significantly reduced the distant failure rate in patients with PNI+ patients (44.9% vs. 54.6%, p = 0.048), not LVI+ patients (65.0% vs. 56.1%, p = 0.487). Conclusion: Compared to LVI, PNI is a more significant prognostic factor in stage II–III rectal patients treated by preoperative CRT and TME surgery. The status of PNI rather than LVI could be an indicator for identifying patients who could benefit from adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear telomere architecture and specific genetic alterations in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), in particular in cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs), has not yet been investigated. We isolated thyrospheres containing CSLCs from B-CPAP, K1, and TPC-1 PTC-derived cell lines, representative of tumors with different genetic backgrounds within the newly identified BRAFV600E-like PTC subgroup, and used immortalized normal human thyrocytes (Nthy-ori 3.1) as control. We performed quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, 3D imaging, and 3D telomere analysis using TeloView software to examine telomere dysfunction in both parental and thyrosphere cells. Among the 3D telomere profile, a wide heterogeneity was observed, except for telomere intensity. Our findings indicate that CSLCs of each cell line had longer telomeres than parental cells, according to telomere intensity values, which correlate with telomere length. Indeed, the thyrosphere cells had lower numbers of lower-intensity telomeres (≤5,000 arbitrary fluorescent units, a.u.), compared with parental cancer cells, as well as parental control cells, (p &lt; 0.0001). The B-CPAP thyrospheres showed a decreased number of higher intensity telomeres (&gt;17,000 a.u.) than K1 and TPC-1 cells, as well as control cells (p &lt; 0.0001). By selecting PTC-derived cell lines with different genetic backgrounds characteristic of BRAFV600E-like PTC subgroups, we demonstrate that thyrosphere cells with BRAFV600E and TP53 mutations show shorter telomeres than those harboring RET/PTC or BRAFV600Eand wild-type TP53. Hence, our data reveal a trend towards a decrease in telomere shortening in CSLCs, representing the early cancer-promoting subpopulation, as opposed to parental cells representing the tumor bulk cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Organic nanoparticles (ONPs) possess great research interests for their promising effects in the enhancement of bioactivity including anticancer activity with less toxicity. The present study describes the preparation, characterization and biological evaluation of aqueous phase ONPs of potent 1,2-disubstituted benzimidazole derivative (BZ6) for anticancer activity. BZ6-ONPs were characterized through UV-absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis for their photo-physical properties. DLS, TEM and SEM studies were carried out for morphological and structural analysis. Cytotoxicity determination on a panel of four different cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MiaPaca-2, HT-29 and HCT-116) revealed that the BZ6-ONPs show highest activity in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Surprisingly, the BZ6-ONPs were found to be non-toxic towards normal breast epithelial fR2 cells. Additionally, the FITC-ONPs showed enhanced uptake in 3D tumor spheroids of MCF-7 cells compared to the free FITC. BZ6-ONPs strongly halted cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, possibly through oxidative stress-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, molecular mechanism-based studies revealed that BZ6-ONPs downregulated AKT/NF-κB/vimentin/survivin-mediated oncogenic signaling pathway promoting cell proliferation and malignancy.

    "Abstract": "Background: The risk factors of lymph node (LN) metastasis are important factors to consider in endoscopic submucosal dissection in early gastric cancer (EGC). The aim of the study was to identify the correlation between mixed histology and LN metastasis in EGC. Methods: A total of 1645 patients who underwent curative radical gastrectomy for EGC were divided into three groups (pure differentiated [pure D], mixed, and pure undifferentiated [pure UD]) according to histologic type. They were subsequently analyzed retrospectively for LN metastasis. The patients who had mixed histology between differentiated and undifferentiated tubular adenocarcinoma were defined as mixed group. Results: The pure UD group was significantly younger than the other groups. Tumor size was larger in the mixed group. LN metastasis occurred more frequently in the mixed group and the pure UD group than in the pure D group (pure D, mixed, and pure UD, 7.7%, 23.2%, and 10.8%, respectively; P < 0.001). A logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for LN metastasis were large tumor size (odd ratio [OR], 1.308), submucosal invasion (OR, 3.565), lymphovascular invasion (OR, 9.755), and histologic types of mixed (OR, 2.360) and pure UD (OR, 1.657). Conclusions: Mixed histology is an important risk factor for LN metastasis in EGC. Thus, radical gastrectomy should be considered in the cases of mixed-type histology after endoscopic resection. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, protein-protein interactions have become an attractive candidate for identifying biomarkers and drug targets for various diseases. However, WD40 repeat (WDR) domain proteins, some of the most abundant mediators of protein interactions, are largely unexplored. In our study, 57 of 361 known WDR proteins were identified as hub nodes, and a hub (WDR54) with elevated mRNA in colorectal cancer (CRC) was selected for further study. Immunohistochemistry of specimens from 945 patients confirmed the elevated expression of WDR54 in CRC, and we found that patients with WDR54-high tumors typically had a shorter disease-specific survival (DSS) than those with WDR54-low tumors, especially for the subgroup without well-differentiated tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that WDR54-high tumors were an independent risk factor for DSS, with a hazard ratio of 2.981 (95% confidence interval, 1.425–6.234; p = 0.004). Knockdown of WDR54 significantly inhibited the growth and aggressiveness of CRC cells and reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model. Each WDR54 isoform (a, b, and c) was found to reverse the inhibitory effect of WDR54 knockdown; however, only isoform c, which exhibited the highest expression, was increased in CRC cells. Sensitization of WDR54 knockdown to an SHP2 inhibitor was consistently found in CRC cells, and the underlying mechanism involved their common function in regulating AKT and ERK signaling. In conclusion, the present study is the first to investigate the significance of WDR54 in cancer and to conclude that WDR54 serves as an oncogene in CRC and may be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Deregulation of microRNAs contributes to the abnormal cell growth which is frequently observed in cancer. In the current study, we detected the expression and regulatory relationship between miR-10a and Lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) to reveal their function in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. We found that miR-10a levels were significantly decreased in PCa cell lines in comparison with the normal epithelial cell line RWPE-1. Downregulation of miR-10a levels was also observed in tumor tissues from PCa patients compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Enhanced expression of miR-10a inhibited cell proliferation and colony forming capability of PCa cells. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease of KDM4A in response to miR-10a elevation in PCa cells. Using dual luciferase assay, we confirmed that KDM4A was a target gene for miR-10a. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated that miR-10a overexpression inactivated YAP signaling and suppressed transcription of YAP target genes. Additionally, cell growth arrest and colony forming capacity inhibition induced by miR-10a overexpression could be reversed by YAP overexpression in PCa cells. More importantly, miR-10a mimics inhibited PC-3 tumor growth in nude mice accompanied with a remarkable reduction of KDM4A and YAP expression. In conclusion, our results uncovered a tumor suppressor role of miR-10a in PCa via negative regulation of KDM4A and its downstream Hippo-YAP pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Evading immune destruction is a hallmark of cancer. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous population of myeloid immune cells, are thought to foster the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, but it remains unclear how. This study aims to determine the levels of circulating MDSCs and their subpopulations and test their immunosuppressive functions in patients with breast cancer (BC). We analyzed the fractions of MDSCs in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with BC and healthy donors using flow cytometry. Circulating MDSCs were further phenotyped using fluorescently labeled antihuman monoclonal antibodies. Coculture experiments revealed the effects of MDSCs on CD3 + T cell response. Moreover, we correlated circulating MDSC levels with clinicopathological features of patients with BC. We show that the fraction of HLA-DR – CD33 + MDSCs in peripheral blood is about 10-fold higher in patients with BC than in healthy control individuals. The levels of all MDSC subpopulations, including monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs, are significantly elevated. Coculture experiments of purified HLA-DR – CD33 + MDSCs and CD3 + T cells demonstrate that T cell proliferation is more effectively inhibited by BC patient-derived MDSCs than by healthy control MDSCs. Moreover, increased circulating MDSC levels robustly associate with advanced BC stage and positive lymph node status. By being more abundant and more effective T cell suppressors, BC patient-derived circulating MDSCs exert a dual immunosuppressive effect. Our findings pave the way to develop novel diagnostic and immunotherapeutic strategies, aimed at detecting and inhibiting MDSCs in patients with BC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Antrodia camphorata (AC) exhibits potential for engendering cell-cycle arrest as well as prompting apoptosis and metastasis inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We performed the current study to explore the anti-epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties of fermented AC broth in TNBC cells. Our results illustrated that noncytotoxic concentrations of AC (20–60 μg/ml) reversed the morphological changes (fibroblastic-to-epithelial phenotype) as well as the EMT by upregulating the observed E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, we discovered treatment with AC substantially inhibit the Twist expression in human TNBC (MDA-MB-231) cells as well as in those that were transfected with Twist. In addition, we determined AC to decrease the observed Wnt/β-catenin nuclear translocation through a pathway determined to be dependent on GSK3β. Notably, AC treatment consistently inhibited the EMT by downregulating mesenchymal marker proteins like N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, ZEB-1, and fibronectin; at that same time upregulating epithelial marker proteins like occludin and ZO-1. Bioluminescence imaging that was executed in vivo demonstrated AC substantially suppressed breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Notably, we found that western blot analysis confirmed that AC decreased lung metastasis as demonstrated by upregulation of E-cadherin expression in biopsied lung tissue. Together with our results support the anti-EMT activity of AC, indicating AC as having the potential for acting as an anticancer agent for the treatment of human TNBC treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Here, we present a functional assay to detect the repair switch to the alternative PARP1-dependent end joining (PARP1-EJ) pathway and the associated susceptibility to PARPi-mediated radiosensitization in freshly collected tumor samples from prostate cancer (PCa) patients, thereby facilitating the selection of patients who should benefit from combined PARPi plus radiotherapy (RT) treatment. Our optimized ex-vivo approach sustains tumor slices for up to 15 days under culture conditions that maintain proliferation and oxygenation rates, as measured by EdU incorporation and pimonidazole staining, respectively. We present a robust system to analyze DSB repair using, for the first time in an ex vivo tumor slice setting, two DSB-markers simultaneously i.e. γH2AX and 53BP1. A computer-based processing method (i) controls variations in DNA content and slicing on the number of repair foci and (ii) measures the PARPi-mediated enhancement ratio on DSB foci numbers to ensure inter-patient-comparability. We validated this approach using a PC3 xenograft model with its previously described repair switch to PARP1-EJ. More importantly, we show that approximately 30% of the analyzed tumor tissue samples collected from PCa patients display a switch to PARP1-EJ, as indicated by the enhanced number of residual γH2AX/53BP1 foci exclusively after PARPi+RT. Furthermore, normal prostatic tissues show no repair switch to PARP1-EJ, indicating that this repair switch and its associated radiosensitizing effect is tumor-specific. Collectively, we present here a predictive assay for the switch to PARP1-EJ that enables individualization of anti-cancer treatment using a combination of RT and radiosensitizing anticancer agents such as PARPi in PCa. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Purvalanol and roscovitine are specific cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, which have antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on various types of cancer. Although, the apoptotic accomplishment of purvalanol and roscovitine was elucidated at the molecular level, the underlying exact of drug-induced apoptosis through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling still speculative. In addition, the role of CDK inhibitors in the downregulation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear. Here, we investigated the potential effect of each CDK inhibitors on cell proliferation, migration, and generation of reactive oxygen species due to the inhibition of MAPKs in metastatic DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells. We reported that purvalanol and roscovitine induced mitochondria membrane potential loss–dependent apoptotic cell death, which was also characterized by activation of several caspases, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in DU145 and PC3 cells. Cotreatment of either purvalanol or roscovitine with ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, synergistically suppressed cell proliferation, and induced apoptotic action. Also, ERK1/2 inhibition potentiated the effect of each CDK inhibitor on the downregulation of EMT processes via increasing the epithelial marker and decreasing mesenchymal markers through reduction of Wnt signaling regulators in DU145 cells. This study provides biological evidence about purvalanol and roscovitine have apoptotic and antimetastatic effects via MAPK signaling on prostate cancer cell by activation of GSK3β signaling and inhibition of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathways involved in the EMT process. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "More than 50 years after the U.S. Surgeon General's first report on cigarette smoking and mortality, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The first report established a causal association between smoking and lung cancer, and subsequent reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable causes of death to include other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and respiratory diseases. For a second level of causes of death, the current evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship with smoking. This study draws on 1980–2004 U.S. vital statistics data and applies a cause-specific version of the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth indirect method, which uses the association between lung cancer death rates and death rates for other causes of death to estimate the fraction and number of deaths attributable to smoking overall and by cause. Nearly all of the established and additional causes of death are positively associated with lung cancer mortality, suggesting that the additional causes are in fact attributable to smoking. I find 420,284 annual smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ for years 2000–2004, 14% of which are due to the additional causes. Results corroborate recent estimates of cause-specific smoking-attributable mortality using prospective cohort data that directly measure smoking status. The U.S. Surgeon General should reevaluate the evidence for the additional causes and consider reclassifying them as causally attributable to smoking. © 2019 The Author",

    "Abstract": "About one in eight women in the U.S. will develop invasive breast cancer at some point in life. Breast cancer is the most common cancer found in women and if it is identified at an early stage by the use of mammograms, x-ray images of the breast, then the chances of successful treatment can be high. Typically, mammograms are screened by radiologists who determine whether a biopsy is necessary to ascertain the presence of cancer. Although historical screening methods have been effective, recent advances in computer vision and web technologies may be able to improve the accuracy, speed, cost, and accessibility of mammogram screenings. We propose a total screening solution comprised of three main components: a web service for uploading images and reviewing results, a machine learning algorithm for accepting or rejecting images as valid mammograms, and an artificial neural network for locating potential malignancies. Once an image is uploaded to our web service, an image acceptor determines whether or not the image is a mammogram. The image acceptor is primarily a one-class SVM built on features derived with a variational autoencoder. If an image is accepted as a mammogram, the malignancy identifier, a ResNet-101 Faster R-CNN, will locate tumors within the mammogram. On test data, the image acceptor had only 2 misclassifications out of 410 mammograms and 2 misclassifications out of 1,640 non-mammograms while the malignancy identifier achieved 0.951 AUROC when tested on BI-RADS 1, 5, and 6 images from the INbreast dataset. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Deshydroxy propioanilides were synthesised by Michael addition reaction between substituted thiophenols onto four different phenylacrylamide derivatives to give twenty-three novel deshydroxy bicalutamide derivatives lacking the central hydroxyl group. The antiproliferative activities of these compounds were evaluated against human prostate cancer cell lines and thirteen compounds showed better inhibitory activities (IC 50 = 2.67–13.19 μM) compared to bicalutamide (IC 50 = 20.44 μM) in LNCaP. Remarkably, novel double branched bicalutamide analogues (27 and 28) were isolated as major by-products and found to have the best activity across three human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP and PC3). The most active compound 28 shows sub-micromolar activity (IC 50 = 0.43 μM in LNCaP), which represents more than 40-fold improvement over the clinical anti-androgen bicalutamide (IC 50 = 20.44 μM) and a more than 3 fold improvement over enzalutamide (IC 50 = 1.36 μM). Moreover, strong reduction of PSA expression in LNCaP cells upon treatment with compounds 27, 28 and 33 was observed during qPCR analysis, confirming their AR antagonist activity. Molecular modelling studies revealed a novel binding mode of these structurally distinct double branched analogues within the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the androgen receptor. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Porous palladium (Pd) nanoparticles have garnered great research attention due to their potential anticancer activity and photothermal effect. In this study, a transferrin-conjugated pH-sensitive platform (Tf-PPP), comprising porous Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) and paclitaxel (PTX), was successfully developed for combined chemo-phototherapy. Tf-PPPs have a small size of 164.6 ± 8.7 nm, PDI of 0.278 ± 0.029, and negative charge (-13.2 ± 1.8 mV). Poly(acrylic acid)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PAA-PEO), a pH sensitive polymer, was used to achieve pH-dependent drug release from nanoparticles. Transferrin (Tf) conjugated on the surface of nanoplatforms could enhance the cellular uptake and prolong nanoparticle accumulation in the tumor site. The combination of phototherapy induced by PdNPs and chemotherapeutic agent (PTX) could exhibit synergistic anticancer activities. Consistent findings were observed in both in vitro experiments including cytotoxicity, live/dead assay, and assessment of apoptotic protein levels, and in vivo antitumor study in MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice, with results decreasing in the following order: Tf-PPPs + NIR > Tf-PPPs > PPPs + NIR > PPPs > PTX > PdNPs. These findings suggest that the administration of Tf-PPPs, followed by NIR irradiation could be a promising strategy in the treatment of cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4), a member of the PEBP family, has been reported to play a pivotal role in tumor progression. However, its role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of PEBP4 in NSCLC EMT. Three human NSCLC cell lines (A549, H1299, and H460) were transfected with pcDNA3.1-PEBP4 or PEBP4-targeting small interfering RNA. Then, cell proliferation was analyzed by the MTT assay, and cell migration and invasion were analyzed by the transwell chamber assay. Protein and messenger RNA expression of the related genes and proteins were assessed by Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results showed that PEBP4 was highly expressed in the human lung cancer tissues and three human NSCLC cell lines. Pretreatment with pcDNA3.1-PEBP4 promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of NSCLC cells and increased EMT in vitro and lung tumor metastasis in vivo. Whereas knockdown of PEBP4 suppressed NSCLC cell migration, PEBP4, and invasion with prevented EMT. Furthermore, PEBP4 overexpression significantly promoted the transcriptional activity of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in NSCLC cells. Further analysis showed that using cyclopamine to inhibit Shh signaling significantly ameliorated the effect on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, as well as EMT triggered by PEBP4 overexpression. Together, these results suggest that PEBP4 may promote tumorigenesis in NSCLC by regulating cell proliferation and EMT via activation of the Shh signaling pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) need to acquire resistance to anoikis to survive after they experience fluid shear stress in the circulatory and lymphatic systems. However, the mechanism by which tumor cells resist anoikis under shear stress conditions remains unknown. Here, we found that the application of low shear stress (LSS; 2 dyn/cm2) to human breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) resulted in increased anoikis resistance when tumor cells were grown under anchorage-independent conditions. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the major component of plasma membrane caveolae, was overexpressed in LSS-treated cells and prevented tumor cells from anoikis, while depletion of Cav-1 restored sensitivity to anoikis. LSS-induced dissociation of Cav-1–Fas inhibited formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, caspase-8 activation, and rendered tumor cells resistant to anoikis. Likewise, LSS blocked the mitochondrial pathway through promotion of integrin β1–focal adhesion kinase-mediated multicellular aggregation and suppression of truncated BID translocation mediated crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which LSS induces anoikis resistance in breast carcinoma cells through inhibition of Cav-1-dependent extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, and serves as a potential therapeutic target for CTCs and metastatic breast cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Taking advantage of the mesoporous structure of bismuth sulfide nanostars (Bi 2 S 3 NSs), a chemotherapeutic drug of doxorubicin (DOX) and a photosensitizer of chlorin e6 (Ce6) were concurrently loaded in the PEGylated Bi 2 S 3 NSs to formulate a multifunctional nanocomplex (BPDC NSs) for tumor theranostics. BPDC NSs have excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and a capacity of yielding reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon laser irradiation, and can realize on-demand drug release by either pH-activation or thermal induction. Accumulation of the nanodrug could be monitored in real-time by infrared thermal imaging, fluorescence imaging and computed tomography (CT). More importantly, the combination effects of photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy were demonstrated to dramatically suppress solid tumors without recurrence in vivo. Featuring low systemic toxicity and high biocompatibility, this nanoplatform could be a promising derivative of Bi 2 S 3 NSs for imaging-guided theranostics of cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cullin 4B (CUL4B), a scaffold protein that assembles CRL4B ubiquitin ligase complexes, is overexpressed in many types of solid tumors and contributes to epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors. However, its clinical significance and underlying molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unknown. Methods: The clinical significance of CUL4B in PCa was characterized by in silico method. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to study the transcript and protein expression levels of CUL4B and C-MYC. Bioinformatics tools, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assay were utilized to identify and characterize the microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated by CUL4B. The biological function of CUL4B and miR-33b-5p was evaluated by MTS, transwell, and wound healing assays, accordingly. Results: CUL4B is significantly overexpressed in PCa tissues compared with benign prostatic tissues and its overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis. CUL4B promotes proliferation and aggressiveness of PCa cells in vitro. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CUL4B upregulates the expression of C-MYC at post-transcriptional level through epigenetic silencing of miR-33b-5p. Importantly, CUL4B-induced oncogenic activity in PCa by targeting C-MYC is repressed by miR-33b-5p. Conclusions: Our results suggested a novel CUL4B/miR-33b/C-MYC axis implicated in PCa cell growth and progression. This might provide novel insight into how CUL4B contributed to PCa aggressiveness and progression. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study was designed to develop a nomogram for assessing the survival of patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES). Methods: Data from patients diagnosed with ES between 2004 and 2013 were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Based on patient registration, the primary cohort was divided into a training set (n = 479, data from 17 cancer registries) and a validation set (n = 137, data from 1 cancer registry). Then, the prognostic effects of variables were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. Moreover, nomograms were established for estimating 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-special survival (CSS) based on Cox regression model. Last, nomogram was validated by training set and validation set. Results: According to the multivariate analysis of training set, nomogram which combined age, race, stage, tumor site, tumor size and chemotherapy was identified. The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram had sufficient discriminatory power with the C-index of OS: 0.754 (95% CI, 0.705–0.802) and CSS: 0.759 (95% CI, 0.700–0.800). The calibration plots also demonstrated good consistence between the prediction and the observation. Conclusion: Our nomogram is a reliable and powerful tool for distinguishing and predicting the survival of ES patients, thus helping to better select medical examinations and optimize treatment options in collaboration with medical oncologists and surgeons. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with the biological activity of hormones. Among EDC's, (anti-)androgenic compounds potentially cause several androgen-related diseases. To improve the accuracy of an in vitro transactivation assay (TA) for detection of (anti-)androgenic compounds, We established the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) knockout 22Rv1/MMTV cell line by using an RNA-guided engineered nuclease (RGEN)-derived CRISPR/Cas system. The 22Rv1/MMTV GRKO cell line was characterized and validated by androgen receptor (AR)-mediated TA assay compared with the AR-TA assay using 22Rv1/MMTV. In conclusion, the AR-TA assay with the 22Rv1/MMTV GRKO cell line was more accurate, excluding the misleading signals derived from glucocorticoids or equivalent chemicals, and might be an effective method for screening potential (anti-)androgenic compounds. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a natural compound with anticancer activities but has low water solubility. In this work, sucrose fatty acid ester (SFAE) was used to nanoencapsulate CAPE in aqueous propylene glycol (PG) with a temperature-cycle method by heating at 90 °C for 20 min and cooling to 21 °C, followed by additional heating at 90 °C for 5 min and cooling to 21 °C. A higher amount of PG facilitated encapsulation with up to 0.1%w/w CAPE in 1.0% w/w SFAE. Additional 0.3%w/w thymol further improved the CAPE loading capability to 0.15%w/w to form nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm and stable in 30 days at 21 °C. Nanoencapsulation enhanced cytotoxicity of CAPE against colon cancer HCT-116 and breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and thymol additionally enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAPE dispersions. This work provides a new approach to nanoencapsulate CAPE in stable aqueous dispersions with improved cytotoxicity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) play critical roles in the development and progression of cancers. However, little is known about the function and mechanism of lncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we investigated the expression and functional role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 20 (SNHG20) as well as its underlying mechanism in NSCLC. Our results showed that SNHG20 was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and cells. High SNHG20 expression was implicated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Moreover, SNHG20 knockdown suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, SNHG20 could function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to elevate ZEB2 and RUNX2 expression by sponging miR-154. Rescue assays revealed that miR-154 inhibition could reverse the inhibitory effect of SNHG20 silence on proliferation, migration and invasion in NSCLC cells. More importantly, SNHG20 knockdown suppressed tumor growth in NSCLC in vivo through suppressing miR-154 and elevating ZEB2 and RUNX2 expression. In summary, knockdown of lncRNA SNHG20 suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion, and promotes apoptosis through up-regulating ZEB2 and RUNX2 expression by sponging miR-154 in NSCLC, providing a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC patients. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer that causes death worldwide. Although much has been learned about the molecular basis of melanoma genesis and progression, there is also increasing appreciation for the continuing discovery of melanoma genes to improve the genetic understanding of this malignancy. In the present study, melanoma candidate genes were identified by analysis of the common network from cancer type-specific RNA-Seq co-expression data and protein-protein interaction profiles. Then, an integrated network containing the known melanoma-related genes represented as seed genes and the putative genes represented as linker genes was generated using the subnetwork extraction algorithm. According to the network topology property of the putative genes, we selected seven key genes (CREB1, XPO1, SP3, TNFRSF1B, CD40LG, UBR1, and ZNF484) as candidate genes of melanoma. Subsequent analysis showed that six of these genes are melanoma-associated genes and one (ZNF484) is a cancer-associated gene on the basis of the existing literature. A signature comprising these seven key genes was developed and an overall survival analysis of 461 cutaneous melanoma cases was carried out. This seven-gene signature can accurately determine the risk profile for cutaneous melanoma tumors (log-rank P=3.27E-05) and be validated on an independent clinical cohort (log-rank P=0.028). The presented seven genes might serve as candidates for studying the molecular mechanisms and help improve the prognostic risk assessment, which have clinical implications for melanoma patients.",

    "Abstract": "Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a major component of the thioredoxin system, makes a critical role in regulating cellular redox signaling and is found to be overexpressed in many human cancer cells. TrxR has become an attractive target for anticancer agents. In this work, three Ru(II) complexes with salicylate as ligand, [Ru(phen) 2 (SA)] (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, SA = salicylate, 1), [Ru(dmb) 2 (SA)] (dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine, 2) and [Ru(bpy) 2 (SA)] (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, 3), were synthesized and characterized. The anticancer effect exerted by them was evaluated. Complex 1 was found to exhibit obvious anticancer activity, in comparison with cisplatin, against cancer cell lines, while displaying low toxicity to the normal cell line BEAS-2B. The mechanism of complex 1 cancer cell growth suppress was investigated in A549 cells. Complex 1 exerted its anticancer through inducing apoptosis and triggering cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Complex 1 can selectively inhibit TrxR activity and thus promote the generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which subsequently trigger mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage, activate oxidative stress-sensitive mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and suppress the protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) signal pathway, resulting in apoptosis in A549 cells. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, three hybrids of podophyllotoxin and formononetin were synthesized and evaluated for anticancer efficacy. Some of the derivatives exhibited potent cytotoxicity against a panel of human and mouse cancer cell lines, with IC 50 values in the low micromolar to submicromolar range. Evaluation against A549 lung tumor cell line identified that the IC 50 value of compound 10a was 0.753 μM, indicating that 10a was 2.568-fold more efficacious than parent podophyllotoxin. Mechanistic studies revealed that 10a induced A549 cell apoptosis mainly via caspase pathway, as well as disrupted the microtubule organization by occupying the colchicine binding site of the tubulin. Moreover, wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay indicated that 10a displayed potent inhibitory effects on invasion and migration in A549 cancer cells. In additiona, a decrease in vimentin immunostaining was also observed in A549 cells after treatment with 10a. Overall, hybrid 10a might be a promising candidate for the potential treatment of human lung carcinoma. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The therapeutic potential of 177 Lu-iPSMA on hypoxic cancer cells has not been yet demonstrated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the radiation dose effect of 177 Lu-iPSMA on viability and DNA damage in U87MG human glioma cells subjected to hypoxia-mimetic conditions. U87MG cells treated with 177 Lu-iPSMA were incubated with CoCl 2 in order to induce hypoxia-mimetic conditions. The cytotoxic and genotoxic effect was evaluated with an in vitro viability test and a neutral comet assay. 177 Lu-iPSMA decreased the cell viability and induced DNA double strand breaks in U87MG human glioma cells under hypoxia-mimetic conditions. 177 Lu-iPSMA produced the maximum effect at 48 h, suggesting that this radiopharmaceutical could be used as a strategy for the treatment of human glioma hypoxic cells. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is among the leading causes of cancer related death. Despite of extensive efforts in identifying valid cancer prognostic biomarkers, only a very small number of markers have been identified. Several genetic variants in the 9p21 region have been identified that are associated with the risk of multiple cancers. Here, we explored the association of two genetic variants in the 9p21 region, CDKN2A/B, rs10811661, and rs1333049 for the first time in 273 subjects with, or without ESCC. We observed that the patients with ESCC had a higher frequency of a TT genotype for rs10811661 than individuals in the control group, and this polymorphism was also associated with tumor size. Moreover, a CC genotype for the rs1333049 polymorphism was associated with a reduced overall survival (OS) of patients with ESCC. In particular, patients with a CC (rs1333049) genotype had a significantly shorter OS (CC genotype: 34.5 ± 8.9 months vs. CG+GG: 47.7 ± 5.9 months; p value = 0.03). We have also shown the association of a novel genetic variant in CDKN2B gene with clinical outcome of patients with ESCC. Further investigations are warranted in a larger population to explore the value of emerging markers as a risk stratification marker in ESCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Amphiphilic polymers containing brush-shaped poly(polyethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate) (PEGA) as a hydrophilic segment may form a stable hydrophilic shell for a polymeric micelle due to a strong interaction among the brush shaped molecules. In this paper, polymeric micelles with brush-shaped poly(PEGA) as hydrophilic shell were designed and formulated as nanocarriers for a new ruthenium (II) complex anticancer drug to address its poor water solubility. Well defined brush-shaped poly(PEGA)-containing amphiphilic block polymers were synthesised by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. The as-prepared amphiphilic polymers formed stable polymeric micelle nanocarriers for the hydrophobic ruthenium (II) complex, resulting in greatly increased solubility of the drug by inhibiting its aggregation in aqueous environment. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that the use of polymeric micelle nanocarriers increased the drug's toxicity to human liver cancer cells (SK-HEP-1) by 3 fold under dark and 12 fold under light conditions. However, both bare drug and encapsulated drug showed no toxicity to the normal cells, demonstrating the drug's potential targeting capacity to cancer cells. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Immunoliposomes (ILs), obtained with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) decorating the liposome surface, are used for cancer treatment. These mAbs provide the recognition of molecules upregulated in cancer cells, like Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1), an immune-checkpoint involved in tumor resistance, forming a complex that blocks this molecule and thereby, induces antitumor immune response. This mechanism introduces a new concept for ILs. ILs coupled to anti-PD-L1 or its Fab’ fragment have been developed and in vitro/in vivo characterized. Factors such as coupling methods, PEG density and ligand size were optimized. In vitro data showed that Fab’-ILs displayed the highest PD-L1 cell interaction, correlating with a higher in vivo tumor accumulation and an increase of effector cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, providing tumor shrinkage and total regression in 20% of mice. Therefore, a novel immune-nanoplatform able to modulate the immune system has been developed, allowing the encapsulation of several agents for combinatorial therapies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Clustering methods for multivariate data exploiting the underlying geometry of the graphical structure between variables are presented. As opposed to standard approaches for graph clustering that assume known graph structures, the edge structure of the unknown graph is first estimated using sparse regression based approaches for sparse graph structure learning. Subsequently, graph clustering on the lower dimensional projections of the graph is performed based on Laplacian embeddings using a penalized k-means approach, motivated by Dirichlet process mixture models in Bayesian nonparametrics. In contrast to standard algorithmic approaches for known graphs, the proposed method allows estimation and inference for both graph structure learning and clustering. More importantly, the arguments for Laplacian embeddings as suitable projections for graph clustering are formalized by providing theoretical support for the consistency of the eigenspace of the estimated graph Laplacians. Fast computational algorithms are proposed to scale the method to large number of nodes. Extensive simulations are presented to compare the clustering performance with standard methods. The methods are applied to a novel pan-cancer proteomic data set, and protein networks and clusters are evaluated across multiple different cancer types. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a lethal disease diagnosed at advanced stages due to the lack of specific biomarkers. Tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), which has recently been found to be related to OC progression, represents a promising potential biomarker for OC diagnosis and prognosis. The discovery of circulating exosomes as biomarkers for various diseases led us to explore exosomal TrkB in OC. Our previous study proved that the expression of TrkB was elevated in OC tissues. In this study, we focused on the detection of exosomal TrkB in OC. Exosomes were first gathered from three different OC cell lines’ conditioned medium, serum samples of patients with OC as well as xenograft mice serum by serial centrifugation method. Then, we identified exosomes by transmission electron microscopy, NanoSight analysis, and expression of typical exosomal protein markers. The existence of TrkB in exosomes was measured by Western blot analysis, and the expression was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In this study, we demonstrated that exosomes could derive from OC cell lines, serum from OC xenograft nude mice, and clinical patients. Our study shows that serum exosomal TrkB may be considered a minimally invasive biomarker for OC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small noncoding RNAs, are widely involved in the regulation of gene expression via binding to complementary sequences at 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of target messenger RNAs. Recently, downregulation of miR-133b has been detected in various human malignancies. Here, the potential biological role of miR-133b in bladder cancer (BC) was investigated. In this study, we found the expression of miR-133b was markedly downregulated in BC tissues and cell lines (5637 and T24), and was correlated with poor overall survival. Notably, transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) was found to be widely upregulated in BC, and overexpression of TAGLN2 also significantly increased risks of advanced TMN stage. We further identified that upregulation of miR-133b inhibited glucose uptake, invasion, angiogenesis, colony formation and enhances gemcitabine chemosensitivity in BC cell lines by targeting TAGLN2. Additionally, we showed that miR-133b promoted the proliferation of BC cells, at least partially through a TAGLN2-mediated cell cycle pathway. Our results suggest a novel miR-133b/TAGLN2/cell cycle pathway axis controlling BC progression; a molecular mechanism which may offer a potential therapeutic target. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Pemetrexed is indicated for non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. Dosing is based on body surface are (BSA), while renal function is the only determinant for exposure and thus toxicity. BSA-based dosing introduces large variability in exposure and may lead to (hemato)toxicity in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, pemetrexed is contraindicated in renal impairment. The presented cases provide proof-of-concept for pharmacokinetically-guided dosing of pemetrexed in a haemodialysis patient and a patient with mild renal impairment. Methods: The pharmacokinetic target was an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 123–205 mg·h/L. Using a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model, individual pharmacokinetics were estimated. Results: Both patients had an exposure above target after the initial dose, but a proportional dose reduction resulted in a therapeutic exposure in both patients (185 and 166 mg·h/L, respectively), that was well-tolerated. Interestingly, a threefold increase in systemic clearance of pemetrexed was observed during hemodialysis (from 1.00 L/h to 3.01 L/h), which approximates the population clearance of pemetrexed. Conclusion: Altogether, we showed that pharmacokinetically-guided dosing of pemetrexed may be a feasible strategy for patients with lung cancer and renal impairment. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the potential role of levocarnitine supplementation for cancer-related fatigue in patients treated with sunitinib. Methods: Patients treated with sunitinib for unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma were enrolled prospectively. Assessment of fatigue in each patient was done using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) questionnaire. Evaluation of fatigue and the serum carnitine level was done at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after sunitinib therapy was initiated. All patients were treated with sunitinib 37.5 mg or 50 mg/day orally, with a 4-week administration and 2-week discontinuation schedule. Results: Ten patients were finally enrolled in the study. Seven of them had worsened fatigue at the 2-week assessment and levocarnitine was administrated. All these seven patients whose serum carnitine level at 2 weeks was worse than at the baseline improved after 2-week-L-carnitine supplementation. For six of the seven (85.7%) patients who had L-carnitine supplementation, the BFI score at 4 weeks decreased compared to that at 2 weeks, which indicated improvement of fatigue. Conclusions: Levocarnitine supplementation for cancer-related fatigue in patients treated with sunitinib appears to have a potential benefit. However, further study with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up is crucial to confirm this. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To examine the possible effects of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) on the safety and efficacy of programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) inhibitors in patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and methods: Clinical data including ANA status were reviewed retrospectively for patients with advanced NSCLC who received monotherapy with a PD-1 inhibitor. Results: Of the 83 patients analyzed, 18 (21.7%) were positive for ANA. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) did not differ significantly between patients with ANA (6/18, 33.3%) and those negative for ANA (21/65, 32.3%), although it tended to increase as the ANA titer increased. Progression-free survival (2.9 versus 3.8 months, p = 0.03) and overall survival (11.6 versus 15.8 months, p = 0.03) were significantly shorter in patients positive for ANA than in those without ANA. Conclusion: PD-1 inhibitors can be administered safely in advanced NSCLC patients positive for ANA without obvious exacerbation of autoimmune disease, although patients with a high titer of such antibodies may warrant close monitoring. However, the presence of ANA might be associated with a poor outcome of such treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various biological process including cancer progression and drug resistance. LncRNA HOXD cluster antisense RNA 1 (HOXD-AS1) had been demonstrated to act as an oncogenic gene, contributing to the development and progression of several cancers. However, its functional role and molecular mechanism underlying glioma progression and cisplatin (DDP) resistance has not been well elucidated. In this study, we found that HOXD-AS1 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cells and negatively correlated with survival time. HOXD-AS1 knockdown suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion as well as enhanced DDP sensitivity of glioma cells. Moreover, HOXD-AS1 could function as a miR-204 sponge in glioma cells. Overexpression of miR-204 could mimic the functional role of down-regulated HOXD-AS1 in glioma cells. Furthermore, miR-204 inhibition reversed the effect of HOXD-AS1 knockdown on cancer progression and DDP sensitivity of glioma cells. In conclusion, knockdown of HOXD-AS1 suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion and enhanced DDP sensitivity of glioma cells through sequestering miR-204, providing a promising therapeutic target for glioma patients. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Dysregulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2S (UBE2S) contributes to tumor progression. However, its clinical significance and biological function in endometrial cancer (EMC) remain unclear. Here, we show that UBE2S is upregulated in EMC and exhibits oncogenic activities via activation of SOX6/β-Catenin signaling. High expression of UBE2S is significantly associated with poor prognosis in two independent cohorts consisting of a total of 773 patients with EMC. in vitro studies demonstrate that ectopic expression of UBE2S promotes cell proliferation and migration, whereas knockdown of UBE2S results in opposite phenotypes. Overexpression of UBE2S in EMC cells enhances the nuclear translocation of β-Catenin, and subsequently induces the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1. Inhibition of β-Catenin by XAV-939 markedly attenuates UBE2S-promoted cell growth. Mechanistically, UBE2S suppresses the expression of SOX6 to trigger β-Catenin signaling. Re-expression of SOX6 in UBE2S-expressing EMC cells abolishes the nuclear localization of β-Catenin. Collectively, these data suggest UBE2S may serve as a promising prognostic factor and function as an oncogene in EMC. The newly identified UBE2S/SOX6/β-Catenin axis represents a new potential therapeutic target for EMC intervention. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: The classical protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have been widely reported to be associated with various human malignancies including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there are few comprehensive analyses of the association between the classical PTP genes and CRC risk. Methods: First, a bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify missense variants within the classical PTP gene family. Second, exome-wide association data and an independent population study were conducted to evaluate effects of candidate variants on CRC risk. Finally, functional assays based on signaling pathways were applied to uncover the potential pathogenic mechanism. Results: We identified that PTPN12 rs3750050 G allele presented a 19% increase the risk of CRC, with an OR of 1.19 (95% CI = 1.09–1.30, P = 1.015×10 −4 ) under an additive model in the combined analysis. Furthermore, biochemical assays illustrated that rs3750050 could impair the inhibitory effect of PTPN12 on Ras/MEK/ERK signaling by impeding SHC dephosphorylation, increase the expression of cyclin D1 and ultimately lead to aberrant cell proliferation, thus contributing to CRC pathogenesis. Conclusion: Our study highlights that PTPN12 rs3750050 could increase CRC risk by modifying Ras/MEK/ERK signaling. This work provides a novel insight into the roles of genetic variants within PTP genes in the pathogenesis of CRC. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important regulatory role in tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to analyze the circRNA expression network and elucidate its potential implications in colorectal cancer (CRC). The circRNA expression profile was analyzed in CRC tissues by RNA sequencing, and the functions of differentially expressed genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The circRNA network was predicted with bioinformatics. On the basis of the results, we identified 23 differentially expressed circRNAs in CRC; GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that the changes in circRNAs were mainly associated with regulation of biological and metabolic processes through binding to other molecules. In addition, based on the predicted coexpression network, we identified a hub circRNA, hsa_circ_0009022. Subsequently, the results of sequencing were confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and hsa_circ_0000826 was found to be downregulated in CRC. Taken together, these findings indicate a set of differentially expressed circRNAs that may serve as a candidate diagnostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target in CRC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The prognosis of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) remains poor. Methods: GSE16560, GSE32448, GSE79957, GSE17951, and TCGA-PRAD were reanalyzed to evaluate the expression of homeobox B7 (HOXB7) between PCa tissues and normal prostate tissues and to characterize the correlation between the expression of HOXB7 and the clinicopathological features of patients with PCa. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to investigate the mechanisms. Results: HOXB7 was upregulated in PCa tissues (P = 0.0005). Both the univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the expression of HOXB7 was correlated with the Gleason score and TNM staging of patients with PCa. The Gleason score and TNM staging were higher in the HOXB7 high expression group. The overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.632; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4773-0.8369; P = 0.0014) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.544; 95% CI: 0.3157-0.9373; P = 0.0283) favored patients with PCa in HOXB7 low expression group over those in HOXB7 high expression group. PCa samples in HOXB7 low expression group were enriched in gene sets associated with the epithelial mesenchymal transition, apical junction, angiogenesis, ultraviolet response, and hypoxia. Conclusions: HOXB7 might be an independent prognostic factor of patients with PCa. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "MutT homologue 1 (MTH1) protects the nucleotide pool from oxidative stress by hydrolyzing oxidized nucleoside triphosphates and prevents their incorporation into DNA. Cancer cells are dependent on the MTH1 activity for survival due to the high-level of reactive oxygen species in cancer cells; therefore, MTH1 is considered to be a novel target for treatment of various cancers. Here, we show by X-ray crystallographic screening using an in-house cocktail library that α-mangostin, a natural xanthone from mangosteen pericarp, binds to the active site of MTH1. A subsequent inhibition assay revealed that 3-isomangostin, a cyclized derivative of α-mangostin, was the most potent MTH1 inhibitor, with an IC 50 value of 0.052 μM. Detailed structural analyses of the MTH1-3-isomangostin complex showed the novel binding mode of 3-isomangostin. Our results demonstrate that X-ray crystallographic screening is useful for the lead discovery for MTH1, and suggest that 3-isomangostin would be an attractive chemical tool for the development of anticancer agents. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is one of the most effective treatments for bladder cancer. Little attention has been paid to the possible role of neutrophils in BCG immunotherapy. In this study, we examined neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation induced by BCG stimulation, and found that BCG-induced NETs exerted cytotoxicity, induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, and inhibited migration in bladder tumor cells. BCG-activated tumor cells but not non-activated ones elicited NETs formation, in which IL-8 and TNF-α from activated tumor cells both took effect. Moreover, NETs activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exhibited a higher expression of CD4 and Th1 cytokines. Additionally, the role of NETs in vivo contributed to the recruitment of T cells and monocytes-macrophages and tissue damage, thus preventing tumor growth. NETs proteins mainly caused these effects on tumor and cellular immunity. In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel immunoregulatory role for NETs in the early stages of BCG immunotherapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Doxorubicin (Dox) is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers. However, Dox-induced cardiotoxicity limits its further clinical use. We have previously reported a small molecular named biotin-conjugated ADTM analog (BAA) that exhibits cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress–induced cell injury in cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. Here, the protective effects of BAA, indexed by attenuation of the cardiotoxicity induced by Dox as well as synergistic antitumor activity that increases the chemotherapeutic efficacy of Dox were investigated. Our results demonstrated that BAA significantly ameliorated Dox-induced toxicity in the H9c2 cells and zebrafish models. In addition, BAA attenuated Dox-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in H9c2 cells. An ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylbutyric acid, reversed the protective effect of BAA in H9c2 cells. In contrast, in human breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, BAA significantly enhanced Dox-induced cytotoxicity through upregulating Dox-induced ER stress response. Taken together, our findings indicate that Dox combined with BAA can significantly enhance its antitumor activity in breast cancer cells and reduce its cardiotoxicity, at least in part, by mediating ER stress activation. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cerium oxide nanoparticles are associated with anticancer effects. While protecting normal cells, these nanoparticles exert their anticancer effects via oxidative stress and apoptosis in the cancer cells. In this study, the anticancer properties of nanoceria on fibrosarcoma cell line are evaluated. Cerium oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by the coprecipitation method and their anticancer effects on mouse fibrosarcoma tumor cells (WEHI164) were investigated. Viability assay was evaluated by MTT, and the DC-FDA assay performed for the detection of reactive oxygen species. For apoptosis assay, the annexin V/PI test was done as well as measuring the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bax and Bcl2 by real-time PCR and western blot method, respectively. Characterization of nanoceria reveals that synthesized nanoceria has cubic floruit structure with a size of about 30 nm. Toxicity assessment results show that nanoceria increases ROS levels and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in cancer cells (WEHI164), whereas low levels of toxicity were observed in normal cells (L929), even at the concentrations above 250 µg/ml in MTT assay. Real-time PCR and western blot assays showed that nanoceria could significantly increase the Bax expression in cancer cells. The results showed that nanoceria could act as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of fibrosarcoma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Biocompatible mixed nanomicelles consisting of sodium deoxycholate and D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate have been prepared in different molar ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100) in order to improve the aqueous solubility and in vitro anti-tumor activity of methotrexate. The nanomicelles loaded with methotrexate were prepared without using any organic solvents and characterized in terms of critical micellar concentration, particle size and drug solubilization capacity of the micellar dispersion. The optimized formulation (ratio 25:75) exhibited a spherical shape and a particle size of about 8 nm. The results of the in vitro release assay showed that the micellar system presented a sustained release behaviour compared to the solution of methotrexate. Cell viability studies in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells revealed that mixed micelles achieved lower IC50 values, in comparison to methotrexate and pralatrexate solutions. The formulated system showed a significant increase in the methotrexate cellular uptake, when compared to the free drug in both cell lines. Furthermore, hemolytic assay confirmed that methotrexate-loaded mixed micelles are compatible with red blood cells. Therefore, the mixed micelles developed in this study might be a potential nano-drug delivery system capable of overcoming in vitro resistance to methotrexate in breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common and the most malignant form of brain tumor. This devastating tumor results in death within a year after diagnosis. Although the tumor mass can be surgically removed, glioma cells invade other areas in the brain leading to tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Therefore, new agents that can overcome cancer cell invasion are urgently required. Phyllanthus taxodiifolius Beille (P. taxodiifolius), has been reported to have potent anti-cancer activities. However, its effects on glioblastoma cells and its underlying mechanisms have never been revealed. Here we investigated the effect and underlying mechanisms of P. taxodiifolius extract on aggressive properties of the glioblastoma, including adhesion, migration, and invasion. P. taxodiifolius extract disrupted adhesion, delayed migration and interfered with the invasion of glioblastoma cells. In addition, the extract suppressed microtubule dynamics as shown by live imaging of a microtubule plus tip protein and decreased focal adhesion by decreasing focal adhesion kinase activity. Our study is the first evidence showing that P. taxodiifolius extract suppresses invasive properties of glioblastoma cells by disrupting microtubule structure and interfering with microtubule dynamics, suggesting the possibility to further develop P. taxodiifolius and its bioactive compounds as an anti-cancer drug targeting microtubules in glioblastoma. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Sunitinib (SUN) is an effective and extensively used anticancer agent, but its application is greatly limited by its adverse and undesirable systemic toxic effects. The targeted delivery of SUN could reduce systemic toxicity while maintaining local anti-tumoral efficacy. In this research, a novel nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) modified with biotin has been designed to overcome this limitation. SUN loaded biotin targeted NLCs (biotin-SUN-NLCs) were prepared by emulsion-solvent diffusion and evaporation method and optimized using irregular factorial design. The morphology of optimized NLCs was studied using SEM. The cytotoxicity of free SUN, SUN-NLCs, and biotin-SUN-NLCs and blank NLCs was evaluated on A549 cells by MTT assay. The optimized formulation presented spherical particle with a mean size of 125.50 nm, 85.10% EE, zeta potential of 10.23 mV, drug release efficiency of about 62.85% during 8 h and PdI < 0.3. Cytotoxicity of biotin-SUN-NLCs was significantly enhanced compared to that of free SUN and SUN-NLCs. The Flow cytometry and fluorescent microscope demonstrated that the biotin-NLCs exhibited higher cellular uptake in A549 human lung cells than non-targeted NLCs. In conclusion, it can be suggested that biotin-SUN-NLCs have advantages and potential for targeted lung cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Cancer patients face many health challenges, including spiritual issues. Therefore, an awareness of health-care providers' perspective on spiritual care provision is important. This study aimed to determine health-care providers' perception of spiritual care and to examine the individual barriers to its implementation in cancer patients. Methods: The present descriptive study included 136 physicians and nurses. The Spiritual Care Survey was used as a research tool. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.0. Results: In this study, 70.6% of the participants considered spiritual care to be influential in the patients' quality of life. However, 64.7% had received no spiritual care training, while 82.4% indicated a willingness to attend these courses. Regarding the obstacles to providing spiritual care, the highest and lowest scores, respectively, belonged to the lack of time and the person's reluctance to talk about spiritual issues. Conclusions: Spiritual care has not yet found its proper place in the care setting of Iran, and health-care team members do not have sufficient training to provide this kind of care despite their belief in its positive impact on patients' quality of life. © 2018 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co.

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy, and the metabolic properties of CRC cells include enhanced aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect). Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) is one of the crucial enzymes that regulate the activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleodinucleotide dependent enzymes. Targeting NAMPT is a potential method of CRC therapy. Nevertheless, the underlying clinical implications and regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT in CRC remain unclear. In this study, we showed that NAMPT protein expression was increased in subjects with rectal localization compared with those with colon localization, and NAMPT was a poor prognostic marker for the overall survival rate in patients with CRC. In addition, the NAMPT inhibitor FK866 or lentivirus-mediated silencing induced CRC cell growth inhibition. Mechanistically, NAMPT regulated Sirt1 and P53 expression and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, along with the upregulation of downstream p21 and downregulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E1, and cyclin E2 expression. FK866 administration or knockdown of NAMPT induced CRC cell apoptosis via upregulation of caspase-3. In conclusion, NAMPT regulated Sirt1/P53 signaling during CRC cell growth and warrants further investigation for clinical administration in CRC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cisplatin remains the standard first-line chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of many types of cancers, but its clinical application is hindered by its severe nephrotoxicity. Previous studies reported that scutellarin enhanced the anti-cancer activity of cisplatin in lung cancer cells, with no confirmation on cisplatin-induced renal damage. Here, we investigated the nephroprotective effect of scutellarin on cisplatin-induced renal injury and its underlying mechanisms. Renal function, histological change, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and involved pathways were investigated. Pretreatment with scutellarin prevented cisplatin-induced decline of renal function including BUN, CRE, and histological damage. Scutellarin also reduced renal inflammation by suppressing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α and IL-6. Similarly, scutellarin administration inhibited apoptosis triggered by cisplatin through reducing the expressions of Cleaved caspase-3, Cleaved PARP, p53, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Moreover, scutellarin prevented cisplatin-induced inhibition of autophagy via enhancing LC3-II/LC3-I and Atg7, and inhibition of p62. Of note, the activations of JNK, ERK, p38 and stat3 induced by cisplatin were strikingly attenuated in scutellarin-treated mice. Thus, these results provide compelling evidence that scutellarin is a novel nephroprotectant against cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a large and diverse class of transcribed RNA molecules with a length of more than 200 nucleotides that modulate the gene expression at the posttranscriptional or transcriptional level. LncRNAs played crucial roles in many biological processes, such as cell proliferation, metastasis, and migraton. In this study, we evaluated the role of lincRNA-p21 in the gastric cancer (GC). We demonstrated that the expression level of lincRNA-p21 was downregulated in the GC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, ectopic expression of lincRNA-p21 suppressed the GC cell growth, cell cycle, and migration. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the X-ray increased the expression level of lincRNA-p21 in both the HCG-27 and SGC7901 cells and elevated expression of lincRNA-p21 increased the radiotherapy sensitivity of the GC cell. In addition, we showed that ectopic expression of lincRNA-p21 suppressed the β-catenin and c-myc expression. Overexpression of lincRNA-p21 inhibited the GC cell proliferation and increased the radiosensitivity of GC cells by regulating the β-catenin signaling pathway. These data suggested that lincRNA-p21 acted as a tumor suppressor gene in the development of GC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This case study followed a 4-year-old Caucasian female in cancer remission who presented with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given the age of this young girl and the health difficulties that she experienced, the preschool PTSD treatment (PPT) manual was implemented to address her distressing symptoms. In addition, it was important to include this young girl’s primary caregiver at each step of the treatment process. Following treatment, this young girl demonstrated significant improvement in her symptomology, as measured quantitatively and qualitatively. Further, this young girl was able to utilize the skills and techniques that she learned and generalize them to other circumstances that caused discomfort or emotional difficulty for her. This case study also demonstrated that incorporating intensive parental involvement with PPT can further the reduction of PTSD symptoms in young children who have experienced medically related trauma. © The Author(s) 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding transcriptional regulatory relationships among genes is important for gaining etiological insights into diseases such as cancer. To this end, high-throughput biological data have been generated through advancements in a variety of technologies. These rely on computational approaches to discover underlying structures in such data. Among these computational approaches, Bayesian networks (BNs) stand out because their probabilistic nature enables them to manage randomness in the dynamics of gene regulation and experimental data. Feedback loops inherent in networks of regulatory relationships are more tractable when enhancements to BNs are applied to them. Here, we propose Restricted-Derestricted dynamic BNs with a novel search technique, Restricted-Derestricted Greedy Method, for such tasks. This approach relies on the Restricted-Derestricted Greedy search technique to infer transcriptional regulatory networks in two phases: restricted inference and derestricted inference. An application of this approach to real data sets reveals it performs favourably well compared to other existing well performing dynamic BN approaches in terms of recovering true relationships among genes. In addition, it provides a balance between searching for optimal networks and keeping biologically relevant regulatory interactions among variables. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The composition of microbiota may influence the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). In addition, probiotics can decrease the chance of developing cancer or its progress. For that reason, it is encouraging to assess the influence of plant extracts as adjuvants of the health-promoting effects of probiotics. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the in vitro beneficial properties of Calyptranthes tricona leaf ethanol extract in association or not with the lactic yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus on colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. C. tricona extract inhibited the in vitro p38α MAPK activity and exhibited immunomodulation on isolated human lymphocytes. Further, the extract did not induce cytotoxicity towards K. marxianus or Caco-2 cells; leading to an increased yeast adhesion to cells in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, this preliminary study demonstrates that C. tricona extract has effects on enzyme inhibition and immune function. In addition, when associated with K. marxianus, C. tricona may possess beneficial properties for application as enhancer of probiotic's protective role on CRC cells. However, further studies are necessary in order to elucidate the mechanisms involved. © 2019 Phytochemical Society of Europe",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, the NOTCH signaling pathway has been gradually studied in human malignancies. Inactivation of the NOTCH signaling pathway was uncovered to be correlated with the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer (BCa). Nevertheless, the specific molecular mechanism of NOTCH1 (one of the core factors of the NOTCH signaling pathway) is not well elucidated in BCa. This study focused on the mechanism by which NOTCH1 affects the biological behaviors of BCa cells. According to the experimental results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, NOTCH1 was dysregulated in BCa tissues and cell lines. The prognostic value of NOTCH1 for the patients with BCa was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Mechanism investigations revealed that NOTCH1 is a target of miR-34c-5p in BCa. Furthermore, microarray analysis was used to find the dysregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), which can bind with miR-34c-5p. Mechanism experiments further demonstrated the rationality of the HCG18-miR-34c-5p-NOTCH1 pathway. Functional assays were then applied to validate the inhibitory influences of NOTCH1 on the proliferation and migration of BCa cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of NOTCH1 could be affected by miR-34c-5p or lncRNA HCG18. All findings in this study revealed that NOTCH1 suppresses the BCa progression by cooperating with lncRNA HCG18 and miR-34c-5p. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Diagnosis of brain cancer using existing imaging techniques, e.g., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is shrouded with various degrees of challenges. At present, there are very few significant research models focusing on introducing some novel and unique solutions towards such problems of detection. Moreover, existing techniques are found to have lesser accuracy as compared to other detection schemes. Therefore, the proposed paper presents a framework that introduces a series of simple and computationally cost-effective techniques that have assisted in leveraging the accuracy level to a very higher degree. The proposed framework takes the input image and subjects it to non-conventional segmentation mechanism followed by optimizing the performance using directed acyclic graph, Bayesian Network, and neural network. The study outcome of the proposed system shows the significantly higher degree of accuracy in detection performance as compared to frequently existing approaches.

    "Abstract": "Combination of photosensitizers (PS) for photodynamic therapy with NO photodonors (NOPD) is opening intriguing horizons towards new and still underexplored multimodal anticancer and antibacterial treatments not based on “conventional” drugs and entirely controlled by light stimuli. In this contribution, we report an intriguing molecular hybrid based on a BODIPY light-harvesting antenna that acts simultaneously as PS and NOPD upon single photon excitation with the highly biocompatible green light. The presented hybrid offers a combination of superior advantages with respect to the other rare cases reported to date, meeting most of the key criteria for both PSs and NOPDs in the same molecular entity such as: (i) capability to generate 1 O 2 and NO with single photon excitation of biocompatible visible light, (ii) excellent 1 O 2 quantum yield and NO quantum efficiency, (iii) photogeneration of NO independent from the presence of oxygen, (iv) large light harvesting properties in the green region. Furthermore, this compound together with its stable photoproduct, is well tolerated by both normal and cancer cells in the dark and exhibits bimodal photomortality of cancer cells under green light excitation due to the combined action of the cytotoxic 1 O 2 and NO. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has demonstrated survival benefits, although some treatment responders (defined as patients with non-progressive disease) are forced to discontinue treatment because of severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs). An association between treatment efficacy and irAEs has been reported. However, it is unclear which treatment responders are likely to develop severe irAEs. We aimed to examine risk factors for ICI-related severe irAEs in patients with NSCLC. Materials and methods: Between February 2016 and October 2018, we retrospectively evaluated 42 patients with NSCLC at our institution who responded to ICI treatment. Tumor burden was measured as the sum of the unidimensional diameters of up to five target lesions, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Results: ICIs were discontinued in 15 of 42 treatment responders because of severe irAEs. Tumor burden was a significant independent predictor of severe irAEs (p = 0.03). The odds ratio of severe irAEs and tumor burden over 90 mm was 8.62 (95% confidence interval = 1.96–37.9, p = 0.004). Conclusion: A high tumor burden was a risk factor for severe irAEs in patients with NSCLC who responded to ICI treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6), as a transcription factor, has been reported to be involved in cell proliferation, carcinogenesis, and tumor metastasis. Here, we demonstrated the role of HNF6 in tumor growth and liver metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Through bioinformatics and clinical samples analysis, we found HNF6 messenger RNA was upregulated both in CRC primary sites and liver metastases, and its high expression indicated poor survival in CRC patients. In vitro studies confirmed that HNF6 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation. What is more, in mouse models, the xenografts grew significantly faster and liver metastasis rate was nearly 45% higher in mice injected with HNF6-overexpressing cells. Further mechanism exploration showed that HNF6 expression affected cell adhesion and conferred resistance to anoikis in CRC cells. Taken together, HNF6 expression was upregulated in CRC and closely correlated with poor survival. HNF6 promoted CRC cell proliferation and tumor growth, and may contribute to liver metastasis via conferring cell resistance to anoikis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, the functions of circRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the functional roles of circVAPA in CRC. High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed in 4 paired CRC tissues, and circVAPA (hsa_circ_0006990), was identified as a potential functional circRNA. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), circVAPA was found to be up-regulated in CRC patients’ tissues and plasma. Furthermore, circVAPA level was associated with unfavorable clinicopathologic features in CRC. The area under curve (AUC) of ROC was 0.724, suggesting that plasma level of circVAPA could serve as a promising biomarker for CRC detection. Sanger sequencing confirmed the back-splice junction sequences of circVAPA. Actinomycin D and RNase R treatments suggested that circVAPA was highly stable compared with its linear counterpart, and qRT-PCR for the circVAPA level in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions indicated that circVAPA was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in CRC cell lines indicated that circVAPA could promote CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibit apoptosis. miRanda software (v3.3a) was used to predict target miRNAs of circVAPA. Moreover, target miRNAs associated with the KEGG pathway of COLORECTAL CANCER (Entry: map05210; https://www.kegg.jp/) were screened using DIANA-miRPath v.3 platform (Reverse Search module; TarBase v7.0 method). The analyses by miRanda and miRPath suggested that circVAPA could potentially bind to hsa-miR-101-3p (miR-101) associated with the COLORECTAL CANCER pathway. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed a direct interaction between circVAPA and miR-101. Furthermore, circVAPA had no effect on the expression level of miR-101, and miR-101 over-expression had the similar tumor-suppressing effects as circVAPA silencing. The tumor-promoting effect of circVAPA over-expression could be reversed by the up-regulation of miR-101. These data demonstrated that circVAPA promoted CRC progression by sponging miR-101. In conclusion, we have verified that circVAPA is up-regulated in CRC patients’ tissues and plasma, and exerts oncogenic properties by sponging miR-101 in CRC. CircVAPA could serve as a promising biomarker and a therapeutic target for CRC. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Several systemic therapeutic options exist for metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can molecularly profile metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and can influence decision-making, but remains untested in mCSPC. Objective: To determine ctDNA abundance at de novo mCSPC diagnosis and whether ctDNA provides complementary clinically relevant information to a prostate biopsy. Design, setting, and participants: We collected plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from 53 patients newly diagnosed with mCSPC and, where possible, during treatment. Targeted sequencing was performed on cfDNA and DNA from diagnostic prostate tissue. Results and limitations: The median ctDNA fraction was 11% (range 0–84%) among untreated patients but was lower (1.0%, range 0-51%) among patients after short-term (median 22 d) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). TP53 mutations and DNA repair defects were identified in 47% and 21% of the cohort, respectively. The concordance for mutation detection in matched samples was 80%. Combined ctDNA and tissue analysis identified potential driver alterations in 94% of patients, whereas ctDNA or prostate biopsy alone was insufficient in 19 cases (36%). Limitations include the use of a narrow gene panel and undersampling of primary disease by prostate biopsy. Conclusions: ctDNA provides additional information to a prostate biopsy in men with de novo mCSPC, but ADT rapidly reduces ctDNA availability. Primary tissue and ctDNA share relevant somatic alterations, suggesting that either is suitable for molecular subtyping in de novo mCSPC. The optimal approach for biomarker development should utilize both a tissue and liquid biopsy at diagnosis, as neither captures clinically relevant somatic alterations in all patients. Patient summary: In men with advanced prostate cancer, tumor DNA shed into the bloodstream can be measured via a blood test. The information from this test provides complementary information to a prostate needle biopsy and could be used to guide management strategies. Sequencing data were deposited in the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under study identifier EGAS00001003351. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is highly abundant in de novo metastatic prostate cancer, but short-term androgen deprivation therapy rapidly reduces ctDNA. The best approach for tumor molecular subtyping and precision oncology should utilize both primary tissue biopsy and ctDNA. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Abstract": "Developing new deep learning methods for medical image analysis is a prevalent research topic in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning scheme with a novel loss function for weakly supervised breast cancer diagnosis. According to the Nottingham Grading System, mitotic count plays an important role in breast cancer diagnosis and grading. To determine the cancer grade, pathologists usually need to manually count mitosis from a great deal of histopathology images, which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. This paper proposes an automatic method for detecting mitosis. We regard the mitosis detection task as a semantic segmentation problem and use a deep fully convolutional network to address it. Different from conventional training data used in semantic segmentation system, the training label of mitosis data is usually in the format of centroid pixel, rather than all the pixels belonging to a mitosis. The centroid label is a kind of weak label, which is much easier to annotate and can save the effort of pathologists a lot. However, technically this weak label is not sufficient for training a mitosis segmentation model. To tackle this problem, we expand the single-pixel label to a novel label with concentric circles, where the inside circle is a mitotic region and the ring around the inside circle is a “middle ground”. During the training stage, we do not compute the loss of the ring region because it may have the presence of both mitotic and non-mitotic pixels. This new loss termed as “concentric loss” is able to make the semantic segmentation network be trained with the weakly annotated mitosis data. On the generated segmentation map from the segmentation model, we filter out low confidence and obtain mitotic cells. On the challenging ICPR 2014 MITOSIS dataset and AMIDA13 dataset, we achieve a 0.562 F-score and 0.673 F-score respectively, outperforming all previous approaches significantly. On the latest TUPAC16 dataset, we obtain a F-score of 0.669, which is also the state-of-the-art result. The excellent results quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mitosis segmentation network with the concentric loss.

    "Abstract": "Aims: To report the long-term outcome of a single institution series of pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with accelerated partial irradiation using intraoperative electrons (IOERT). Methods: From 2000 to 2010, 180 DCIS patients, treated with quadrantectomy and 21 Gy IOERT, were analyzed in terms of ipsilateral breast recurrences (IBRs) and survival outcomes by stratification in two subgroups. The low-risk group included patients who fulfilled the suitable definition according to American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Guidelines (size ≤2.5 cm, grade 1–2 and surgical margins ≥3 mm) (Suitable), while the remaining ones formed the high-risk group (Non-Suitable). Results: Eighty-four and 96 patients formed the Suitable and Non-Suitable groups, respectively. In the whole population, the cumulative incidence of IBR at 5, 7 and 10 years was 19%, 21%, and 25%, respectively. In the Suitable group, the cumulative incidence of IBR remained constant at 11% throughout the years, while in the Non-Suitable group increased from 26% at 5 years to 36% at 10 years (p < 0.0001). When hormonal positivity and HER2 absence of expression were added to the selection of the Suitable group, the cumulative incidence of IBR dropped and stabilized at 4% at 10 years. None died of breast cancer. In the whole population, 5-year and 10-year overall survival rate was 98% and 96.5%, respectively, without any difference between the two groups. Conclusions: The overall and by group IBR rates were high and stricter criteria are required for acceptable local control for Suitable DCIS. Because of the concerns raised, IOERT should not be used in clinical practice. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Bone metastasis of cancer can be a result from systemic blood spreading or vertebral venous plexus spreading. Systemic blood pathway induced bone metastasis can happen in any bone in the body since the spreading is considered to be random. However, it remains unknown whether there is any pattern of vertebral venous plexus related bone metastasis. In this study, we explored bone metastasis patterns in patients whose primary tumors had been well identified. Methods: We included 290 consecutive cancer patients with bone metastases but no visceral metastases, out of 2559 patients whose bone metastases were diagnosed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography, between Jan 2015 and Oct 2017 at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. We excluded those with visceral metastasis to ensure that our study focused on metastasis through the vertebral venous plexus. And we analyzed the distribution and pattern of skeletal metastases. Results: Of the 290 patients, 28 had head and neck tumors, 178 had thorax tumors, 49 had abdominal tumors and 35 had pelvic tumors; 102 (35%) had only one bone containing a metastasis and 188 (65%) had multiple bones containing metastases. Overall, metastases to the thoracic skeleton were more common in patients with thorax tumors than in other patients (81% vs. 67%, P = 0.007); metastases to the cervical spine or thoracic bones were more common in patients with primary tumors above the diaphragm than those below the diaphragm (82% vs. 66%, P = 0.002). Among those with only one bone containing a metastasis (n = 102), patients with head and neck tumors had a higher incidence of cervical spine metastasis than other patients (25% vs. 2%, P = 0.03), those with thorax tumors had a higher incidence of thoracic bone metastasis than other patients (56% vs. 35%, P = 0.035), and those with pelvic tumors had a higher incidence of pelvis bone metastasis than other patients (78% vs. 27%, P = 0.000054). Conclusions: In patients with only one bone containing a metastasis but no visceral metastasis, bones near the primary were more likely to be first metastasized. This may be a valuable clue to primary tumor sites in patients with cancers of unknown primaries. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Radiation-induced lymphopenia (RIL) during therapy is associated with poor prognosis but is often temporary and resolves after treatment completion in esophageal cancer. How lymphocyte recovery contributes to prognosis is unknown. Methods: We reviewed 755 patients with stage I-III esophageal carcinoma who received concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with or without surgery in 2004–2015. Complete blood counts were obtained before, during, and at first follow-up after CRT. Lymphopenia was graded per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03 during CRT (G) and as recovery after CRT (G r ). Clinical factors and lymphopenia grade were tested for association with survival in univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. Results: During CRT, 294 patients (38.9%) had G4 lymphopenia; by the first follow-up, 406 patients (53.8%) had recovered (G r 0-1). Relative to patients with G0-3 lymphopenia during CRT, G4 lymphopenia independently predicted worse OS in multivariable analyses. However, lymphocyte recovery was not associated with a better prognosis. Patients with G4 lymphopenia during CRT and recovery (G r 0-1) afterward still had poorer 5-year OS rate than patients with G0-3 during CRT without recovery (G r 2-4) afterward (36.6% vs. 51.9%, HR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.04–1.89, P = 0.027). Moreover, the lymphocyte recovery ability (post-CRT ALC divided by pre-CRT ALC) was not affected by lymphopenia grade during CRT (0.66 in G0-3 vs. 0.65 in G4, p = 0.473). Among patients with G4 lymphopenia during treatment, lymphocyte recovery was only associated with pre-CRT lymphocyte counts. Conclusion: Lymphocyte count recovery after CRT does not alter the poor long-term outcomes brought about by high-grade lymphopenia during CRT. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Exploration on genetic roles in antineoplastic-related cardiovascular toxicity has increased with the advancement of genotyping technology. However, knowledge on the extent of genetic determinants in affecting the susceptibility to the cardiovascular toxicities of antineoplastic is limited. This study aims to identify potential single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in predicting non-anthracycline antineoplastic-related cardiovascular toxicity. Methods: We systematically searched for original research in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE and HuGE Navigator from database inception until January 2018. Studies on association between polymorphism and antineoplastic-induced cardiovascular toxicity in patients treated for cancer of all antineoplastic agents were included except for anthracycline. Case reports, conference abstracts, reviews and non-patient studies were excluded. Data extracted by two independent reviewers were combined with random-effects model and reported according to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Results: The 35 studies included examined a total of 219 SNPs in 80 genes, 11 antineoplastic and 5 types of cardiovascular toxicities. Meta-analyses showed that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) rs1136201, a risk variants (pooled OR: 2.43; 1.17–5.06, p = 0.018) is a potential predictors for trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. Gene dose effect analysis showed number of variant allele may contribute to the risk too. Conclusions: This review found that HER2 rs1136201 can have the potential in predicting trastuzumab-related heart failure. As such, further studies are needed to confirm the validity of these results as well as determine the economic aspect of using SNPs prior to its implementation as a clinical practice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Integrating mobile applications (apps) into users’ standard electronic health record (EHR) workflows may be valuable, especially for apps that both read and write data. This report details the lessons learned during the integration of a patient decision aid - prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening - into our users’ standard EHR workflow for a small usability assessment. Materials and Methods: This feasibility study included two steps. First we enabled realtime, secure bidirectional data exchange between the mobile app and EHR for 14 data elements, and second we pilot tested the production environment app with 9 primary care patients aged 60–65 years. Our primary usability metric was a net promoter score (NPS), based on users’ recommendation of the app to a friend or family member; we also assessed the proportion of users who 1) updated their prostate cancer risk factor information present in the EHR and 2) submitted more than one unique response regarding their preference to have PSA testing. Results: The seven web services necessary to read and write data required considerable configuration, but successfully delivered risk factor-specific educational content and recorded patients’ values and decision preference directly within the EHR. Seven of the 9 patients (78%) would recommend this app to a friend/family member (NPS = 55.6%), one patient used the app to update risk factor information, and 4/9 (44%) changed their decision preference while using the app. Conclusions: It is feasible to implement a decision aid directly into users’ standard EHR workflow for limited usability testing. Broad scale implementation may have a positive effect on patient engagement and improve shared decision making, but several challenges exist with proprietary EHR vendor application programming interfaces (API)s. © 2019",

    "Funding Text 1": "This research was funded during July 2014 - June 2015 in part by a UCLA Health Sciences Strategic Plan Award . Professor Sarrafzadeh provided additional funding to support the mobile app development. Summary points What was already known on this topic • Research proven effective applications may not be highly utilized by clinical practitioners. • Applications that are integrated into users’ standard workflow may lead to improved dissemination and implementation. • Engaging patients in shared decision making (SDM) is important to optimize patient-centered outcomes, provide high quality care, and help control health care costs. What this study added to our knowledge • An mHealth app/EHR integration using non-FHIR APIs is feasible for limited usability testing, but presents several challenges to scale. • Most patients perceived this app as useful, and several changed their decision preference while using it. • Widespread use of this app among primary care patients may better align testing with each individual’s documented values and preference.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved survival for patients with metastatic melanoma. The types of disease-response patterns to ICI therapy can be more complex relative to traditional chemotherapy and include mixed responses, pseudoprogression, and oligoprogression. The potential benefit of surgery after incomplete response to ICI therapy has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to explore outcomes of surgery after ICI therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at two centers and included patients with melanoma who underwent surgery after treatment with monotherapy or combination therapy with anti–programmed cell death protein (PD) 1 and/or anti–cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein (CTLA)-4 checkpoint blockade. Results: Of 25 patients, nine received anti–CTLA-4 therapy, eight received anti–PD-1 therapy, and eight received both anti–CTLA-4 and anti–PD-1 therapies before surgery. Five patients were treated in the adjuvant setting and developed new lesions, whereas 20 patients were treated for metastatic disease and underwent surgery for persistent disease on imaging after ICI therapy. Twenty-five patients underwent 30 operations without complications. Twenty-seven of 30 masses were confirmed to be melanoma on pathology, one was a desmoid tumor and two were necrosis. At a median follow-up of 14.2 months, 2 patients died, 8 were alive with a known disease, and 15 continued to have no further evidence of disease. Conclusions: Surgery was well tolerated in this cohort of patients receiving ICI therapy for melanoma. Surgery may benefit select patients with an oligoprogressive disease after ICI therapy. After a mixed response, surgery remains the only definitive method to render some patients free of disease. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Despite the benefits of concomitant radiotherapy and cisplatin for locally advanced cervical cancer, recurrence rates remain high. New treatment strategies such as consolidation chemotherapy and different concomitant chemotherapy combinations have been tested in recent years. Identification of the best candidates for each treatment strategy could optimize results. Study design: A retrospective review of data from 127 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stages IIB–IVA), treated at a single institution from 2005 to 2014. Risk factors for loco-regional and systemic recurrence, and prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were analysed using Cox regression. Survival of patients treated with consolidation chemotherapy was compared with survival of patients not treated with consolidation chemotherapy in the role cohort and in a propensity-score-matched cohort. Results: With a median follow-up time of 48.7 months, loco-regional-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and OS at 5 years were 76.6%, 54.0% and 63.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, tumour size ≥6 cm was associated with shorter LRFS [hazard ratio (HR) 5.18; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45–18.45; p = 0.011], and adenocarcinoma (HR 2.48; 95% CI 1.10–5.57; p = 0.028) and positive lymph nodes (HR 2.21; 95% CI 1.303–4.72; p = 0.041) were associated with shorter DMFS. Tumour size ≥6 cm was associated with shorter OS (HR 2.64; 95% CI 1.09–6.35; p = 0.031). Twenty-two patients were treated with consolidation chemotherapy; on univariate analysis, these patients had longer OS compared with patients who were not treated with consolidation chemotherapy (p = 0.043). In a propensity-score-matched cohort, patients treated with consolidation chemotherapy had longer DMFS and OS compared with patients who were not treated with consolidation chemotherapy, although the difference was not significant. Conclusions: Different risk factors are associated with loco-regional and distant metastases in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer, and could potentially lead to particular therapeutic strategies. Although the number of patients treated with consolidation chemotherapy in the study cohort was small, they seemed to live longer and to have better control of distant relapse then patients who were not treated with consolidation chemotherapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Sarcopenia is a syndrome that is defined by the loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength. In adult patients with malignancies, the presence of sarcopenia is known to be correlated with a poor prognosis; however, there have been no reports on the influence of sarcopenia on malignant tumors in pediatric patients. In the present study, we investigated whether or not sarcopenia affects the prognosis of high-risk neuroblastoma. Materials and methods: Thirteen patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who were treated according to the standard protocol at our hospital from 2007 to 2016 were divided into a progression-free survival group (n = 8) and a relapse/death group (n = 5). The rate of change in sarcopenia was calculated by comparing the psoas muscle area (PMA) of the L3-level lumbar spine on computed tomography before and after treatment with the standard protocol. The rate of change in the PMA, Kaup index, and serum albumin level were compared. Furthermore, we determined the cutoff rate of change in the PMA and compared the overall and progression-free survival. Results: The rates of change in the PMA were 1.24 and 0.84 in the progression-free survival and relapse/death groups, respectively (P = 0.0472). There were no significant differences in the rates of change in the Kaup index or the serum albumin level of the two groups. The patients whose rate of change in the PMA was >1.00 showed a prolonged overall (P = 0.0078) and progression-free survival (P = 0.006). Conclusions: A decrease in the skeletal muscle mass was suggested to be a significant prognostic factor for high-risk neuroblastoma. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chronic inflammation has been implicated in cancer etiology and angiogenesis is stimulated in this disease. In prostate, the crosstalk between malignant epithelial cells and their microenvironment is an essential step of tumorigenesis during which glandular stroma undergo changes designated as reactive stroma. Thus, the aim herewith was to evaluate the effects of associating anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic therapies on cancer progression, correlating them with steroid hormone receptor (AR and ERα), reactive stroma (vimentin, αSMA, and TGF-β), and cell proliferation (PCNA) markers expression in the Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model. Methods: TRAMP mice (12-week old) were divided into the groups: Control (TRCON): received the vehicles used for drug dilution; Celecoxib (TRCEL): received oral doses of the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (15 mg/kg) twice daily; Nintedanib (TRNTB): received oral doses of the antiangiogenic drug nintedanib (10 mg/kg) daily; Nintedanib+Celecoxib (TRNTCEL): received the combination of drugs. After 6 weeks, mice were euthanized and ventral prostate samples were harvested for morphological, immunohistochemical, and Western blotting analyses. Results: While celecoxib led to fibromuscular hypertrophy attenuation, nintedanib significantly reduced the incidence of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (WDAC) foci in relation to controls, both when administered per se or in association to celecoxib. Furthermore, drug combination was associated with unique effects, including lower incidence of HGPIN lesions; lower AR stromal distribution; changes in ERα localization from epithelial nuclei to stroma as well as significant decrease of TGF-β levels and associated angiogenesis. In parallel, all treatments applied resulted in reduced inflammatory marker and vimentin (VIM) expression. Conclusions: Celecoxib plus nintedanib is an effective antitumor combination against prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice, showing remarkable efficacy in relation to isolated therapies. Importantly, this efficacy might be due to drug association effect on driving AR and mainly ERα distribution in the prostatic tissue towards benign patterns. In addition, celecoxib and nintedanib impaired the development of a stromal reaction by reducing the recruitment of reactive stroma cells and maintaining a normal smooth muscle cell-rich prostate stroma in TRAMP mice. Collectively, these findings pointed to the beneficial effects of combining anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic strategies to prevent or delay prostatic tumorigenesis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The aim is to prospectively investigate both the “cohesion” and “network” perspectives of social capital in relation to total, cardiovascular (CVD), cancer and all other causes mortality. The 2008 public health survey in Scania was a postal questionnaire with three letters of reminder, and it was answered in the Autumn by 28,198 respondents (55% participation) aged 18–80 from a stratified random sample of the population register. This baseline was connected with the national causes of death registry (Dödsorsaksregistret) with a more than five-year follow-up August 27- November 14 (depending on individual response) to December 31, 2013 (946 deaths). The analyses were performed in multiple adjusted survival (Cox-) regression models. Results show that low social participation, common to both theoretical perspectives, had consistently high hazard rate ratios (HRRs) of total, CVD, cancer and other morality, and that HRRs of total and CVD mortality remained statistically significant even after adjustments for all covariates including health behaviors, BMI, unmet healthcare needs and self-rated health, HRR 1.28 (1.08–1.52) and HRR 1.79 (1.28–2.50), respectively. In contrast, low social support, specific to the “network” perspective, showed no significant associations with mortality, except for low emotional and instrumental support and other causes mortality for which HRRs remained significant adjusted for demographics and socioeconomic status (SES). Generalized trust in other people, specific to the “cohesion” perspective, showed statistically significant HRRs for total and other causes mortality until adjustments for health-related behaviours and BMI, although not after complete adjustments, and significant HRRs for CVD and cancer mortality before adjustment for health behaviours. In conclusion, low social participation is consistently associated with all forms of mortality, and particularly total and CVD mortality. Social participation represents a strong core of social capital theory, and items should measure both variety of social contact surfaces and intensity. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to systematically compare the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and serum cytokines in identifying pediatric cancer patients with high-risk infection. A prospective observational study was performed from January 2014 through December 2016. Consecutive pediatric cancer patients who experienced febrile illness during hospitalization were enrolled. The CRP, PCT, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ were determined within 6 h of fever onset. A total of 3118 episodes of febrile illness were included, with 13.1% episodes documented as bloodstream infection (BSI) and 3.5% diagnosed as septic shock. Patients with BSI presented much higher levels of PCT, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α than patients with other types of fever and have much higher incidence of septic shock (11.2% vs. 2.3%, P < 0.001). IL-6 and IL-10 showed better performance in identifying patients with gram-negative bacteremia (GNB) and septic shock than CRP and PCT, respectively. The area under the curve (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for septic shock prediction were 0.65, 0.78, 0.89 and 0.87 for CRP, PCT, IL-6 and IL-10, respectively. Furthermore, elevation of IL-6 and IL-10 were strongly associated with the development of GNB and septic shock. Our results indicate that BSI, especially GNB, is a high-risk form of infection which results in high incidence of septic shock. IL-6 and IL-10 performance better than CRP and PCT in identifying patients with high-risk febrile illness. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Aims: Node-positive prostate cancer is a unique subgroup, with varied practice on locoregional treatment. Definitive treatment with hypofractionated radiotherapy has not been widely reported. We have routinely used standard regimens of hypofractionated radiotherapy for node-positive disease and report our results of toxicity, biochemical control and survival. Materials and methods: Medical records of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between February 2011 and April 2016 with radiologically involved pelvic nodes on magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography without distant metastases were analysed. All patients were treated with long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and hypofractionated radiotherapy. Acute and late toxicities were assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute and late morbidity scoring criteria. Biochemical control and survival were computed using Kaplan–Meier survival statistics. Results: In total, 61 patients were identified with node-positive disease, with a median age of 68 years and a median initial prostate-specific antigen level of 40.1 ng/ml. Most, 50 (81.9%), had T3 disease; 47.6% had Gleason 8–10 disease. All were treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy, predominantly 60 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks, with a dose of 44 Gy/20 fractions to the pelvic nodes. Twenty-five patients (41%) who had residual radiologically enlarged nodes after 3–6 months of ADT received nodal boost to the involved nodes, to a dose of 54–60 Gy as simultaneous boost. Incidences of late grade 2 + gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were 13.1 and 18%, respectively, with no grade 4 toxicities. With a median follow-up of 48 months, 15 (24.6%) patients developed biochemical failure, with only four locoregional failures. The 4-year biochemical control rate was 77.5% and overall survival was 91%. Patients who had residual enlarged nodes after initial ADT had worse biochemical control (53.9% versus 93.1% at 4 years, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy using an established fractionation schedule with long-term ADT for node-positive prostate cancer patients is feasible and results in excellent biochemical control rates at 4 years, with acceptable late toxicity rates. The response to initial ADT predicts outcomes. © 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)–targeted positron emission tomography (PET) can visualize metastatic lesions in recurrent prostate cancer (PC). However, reliable identification of small and/or atypically localized lesions during salvage surgery procedures is challenging. Objective: To describe the technique, feasibility, and short-term outcomes of 99m Technetium ( 99m Tc)-based PSMA-radioguided surgery ( 99m Tc-PSMA-RGS) for removal of recurrent PC lesions. Design, setting, and participants: Thirty-one consecutive patients with evidence of recurrent PC on 68 Ga-PSMA N,N′-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl] ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid ( 68 Ga-PSMA-11) PET after radical prostatectomy undergoing 99m Tc-PSMA-RGS were retrospectively analyzed. Surgical procedure: Salvage surgery with intraoperative radioguidance using a gamma probe was performed after intravenous application of 99m Tc-PSMA investigation and surgery (mean activity 571 MBq, mean time to surgery 19.7 h). Measurements: Radioactive rating (positive vs negative) of resected tissue was compared with the findings of postoperative histopathological analysis. Best prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response without additional treatment was determined after 8–16 wk postoperatively. Biochemical recurrence- and treatment-free survival was evaluated. Results and limitations: In total, 132 tissue specimens were removed, of which 58 showed metastatic involvement on histological analysis. On a specimen basis, radioactive rating yielded a sensitivity of 83.6% (confidence interval [CI]: 70.9–91.5%), a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 93.0% (CI: 85.5–96.7%). With 99m Tc-PSMA-RGS, all lesions visualized on preoperative 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET could be removed. Moreover, 99m Tc-PSMA-RGS detected additional metastases as small as 3 mm in two patients. Thirteen patients suffered from complications related to surgery (Clavien-Dindo grade 1: 12 patients; grade 3a: one patient). A PSA reduction below 0.2 ng/ml was observed in 20 patients. Thirteen patients remained biochemical recurrence free after a median follow-up of 13.8 (range: 4.6–18.3) mo. Twenty patients continued to be treatment free after a median follow-up of 12.2 (range: 5.5–18.3) mo. Conclusions: As a new technique for surgical guidance, 99m Tc-PSMA-RGS is feasible, and has been proved to be of high value for successful intraoperative detection and removal of metastatic lesions in PC patients scheduled for salvage surgery. Its long-term impact on outcome has to be evaluated. Patient summary: In this report, we evaluated a novel technique to identify metastatic lesions intraoperatively in patients with recurrent prostate cancer to facilitate surgical removal. After intravenous injection of radioactive molecules that specifically bind to prostate cancer cells that show increased expression of the prostate-specific membrane antigen, we were able to detect and remove these metastatic lesions during surgery. Following salvage surgery, 41.9% of patients remained biochemical recurrence free (median follow-up of 13.8 mo) and 64.5% continued to be treatment free (median follow-up of 12.2 mo). 99m Technetium-based prostate-specific membrane antigen–radioguided surgery as a new surgical technique is feasible, and has been proved to be of high value for successful intraoperative detection and removal of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer patients scheduled for salvage surgery. Its long-term impact on outcome has to be evaluated. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Noncommunicable diseases have become a global pandemic with disproportionately higher rates in low-and middle-income countries. Dominican Republic (DR) as a Latin Americans and Spanish-speaking Caribbean developing country shares a socioculturally distinctive spiritual and religious pattern. It underlines their attitudes, values, and belief systems, socioeconomic reality, and racial attitudes. Social sciences and religious studies suggest that a relationship between spirituality, religion, health-care services (Sp/Re-HCS), and cultural diversity exists. This article argues in favor of a descriptive historical analysis of that relationship. Methods: Systematic search of academic articles, abstracts, and conclusions published in Medline, EBSCO, PsycINFO (OVID), ATLA Religion Database, and Google Scholar was undertaken using a combination of English and Spanish relevant terms. The analysis of articles was examined through a historical background approach, a systematic review, and a content analysis. Results: A Roman Catholic organization, Voluntariado Jesús con los Niños Foundation, serves to cancer patients that have almost no financial protection. The Dominican Evangelical Church (DEC) founded in 1932 a medical service base at the International Hospital in Santo Domingo (IHSD). When the DR government developed medical services, the DEC closed the IHSD. Since then, there is no any DR Evangelical or Protestant organization that offers Sp/Re-HCS to cancer patients (S/R-HCSCP). Conclusions: This analysis suggests that a relationship between S/R-HCS and cultural diversity exists. In this sociohistorical analysis, the nonhomogeneous cultural distinctiveness of the Sp/Re-HCS has been demonstrated through the analytical description of the only one organization of S/R-HCSCP at DR. © 2018 Ann & Joshua Medical Publishing Co.

    "Abstract": "Buparlisib is a pan-class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor and is currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of different cancers. Because PI3K signalling is related to cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy, new therapeutic approaches are focused on combining PI3K inhibitors with other anti-cancer therapeutics. Carbonyl-reducing enzymes catalyse metabolic detoxification of anthracyclines and reduce their cytotoxicity. In the present work, the effects of buparlisib were tested on six human recombinant carbonyl-reducing enzymes: AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1B10, AKR1C3, and AKR7A2 from the aldo-keto reductase superfamily and CBR1 from the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, all of which participate in the metabolism of daunorubicin. Buparlisib exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on recombinant AKR1C3, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 9.5 μM. Its inhibition constant K i was found to be 14.0 μM, and the inhibition data best fitted a mixed-type mode with α = 0.6. The same extent of inhibition was observed at the cellular level in the human colorectal carcinoma HCT 116 cell line transfected with a plasmid encoding the AKR1C3 transcript (IC 50 = 7.9 μM). Furthermore, we performed an analysis of flexible docking between buparlisib and AKR1C3 and found that buparlisib probably occupies a part of the binding site for a cofactor most likely via the trifluoromethyl group of buparlisib interacting with catalytic residue Tyr55. In conclusion, our results show a novel PI3K-independent effect of buparlisib that may improve therapeutic efficacy and safety of daunorubicin by preventing its metabolism by AKR1C3. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the main health threat in the world. Recently, oleuropein has been reported to have potent antioxidant and anticancer activities. However, the antitumor effects of oleuropein on H1299 cells are not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is tantamount to explore the effects of oleuropein on H1299 cells and its underlying mechanism that may be involved. Oleuropein treatment in H1299 cells resulted in cell cycle distribution at G 2 /M arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis was verified by the increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3 on oleuropein-induced H1299 cells. In addition, our data also demonstrated that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway has a critical role in oleuropein-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we used transcriptome analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in H1299 cells by oleuropein and SB203580 treatment. Many DEGs were annotated to metabolic pathways, cell cycle, pathways in cancer, MAPK signaling pathway by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene ontology enrichment methods. Network and expression analysis found that DEGs, including RPS6A5, GADD45A, and MKP, play a key role in the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. In H1299 cells, oleuropein resulted in the expression of numerous genes related to cell signaling, metabolism pathway and directly associated with apoptosis. These results illustrated that oleuropein-induced apoptosis via mitochondrial apoptotic cascade was activated by the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in H1299 cells. Thus, oleuropein as a natural compound and therapeutic drug has potential application value in the treatment of lung cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate if subgroups of patients assigned to MRI category PI-RADS 4 regarding clinical and MRI imaging aspects have distinct risks of prostate cancer (PCa) to facilitate adequate clinical management of this population, especially after negative targeted biopsy. Methods: This prospective, IRB approved single center cross-sectional study includes 931 consecutive patients after mp-MRI at 3 T for PCa detection. 193 patients with PI-RADS assessment category 4 received subsequent combined targeted MRI/US fusion-guided and systematic 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy as reference standard and were finally analyzed. The primary endpoint was PCa detection of PI-RADS 4 with MRI subgroup analyses. Secondary endpoints were analyses of clinical data, location of PCa, and detection of targeted biopsy cores. Results: PCa was detected in 119 of 193 patients (62%) including clinically significant PCa (csPCa; Gleason score ≥3 + 4 = 7) in 92 patients (48%). MRI subgroup analysis revealed 95% PCa (73% csPCa) in unambiguous PI-RADS 4 index lesions without additional, interfering signs of prostatitis in the peripheral zone or overlaying signs of severe stromal hyperplasia in the transition zone according to PI-RADS v2. Transition zone confined PI-RADS-4-lesions with overlaying signs of stromal hyperplasia showed PCa only in 11% (4% csPCa). Targeted biopsy cores missed the csPCa index lesion in 7% of the patients. PSA density (PSAD) was significantly higher in PCa patients. Conclusions: Small csPCa can reliably be detected with mp-MRI by experienced readers, but can be missed by targeted MR/US fusion biopsy alone. Targeted re-biopsy of unambiguous (peripheral) PI-RADS-4-lesions is recommended; whereas transition zone confined PI-RADS-4-lesions with overlaying signs of stromal hyperplasia might be followed-up by re-MRI primarily. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: This study was conducted to identify the significantly altered long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNA (mRNA) and pathways in gastric cancer (GC). Methods: We used microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs, whereas the obviously changed pathways were found by gene set enrichment analysis. The coexpression network of lncRNA and mRNA was constructed by Cytoscape, and their target relationships with miRNAs were predicted by miRcode and TargetScan. qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to determine the expression levels of mRNAs and proteins in tissues and cell lines. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was applied to achieve the determination of the specific target relationships. Cell viability, migration, and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay, wound healing assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Through the xenograft assay, the gastric tumor was implanted into nude mice to investigate the influence of HOTAIRM1 in vivo. Results: HOTAIRM1 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were both downregulated in GC, whereas miR-17-5p was upregulated. Moreover, the PI3K/AKT pathway was found activated in GC. HOTAIRM1 targeted miR-17-5p, whereas PTEN was the downstream target gene of miR-17-5p. HOTAIRM1 suppressed proliferation and migration of GC cell line and induced their apoptosis, whereas miR-17-5p played the opposite role on GC cell line. HOTAIRM1 also postponed tumor growth in vivo and inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway in GC. Conclusions: LncRNA HORAIRM1 suppressed the PI3K/AKT pathway in GC and inhibited the progression of GC by serving as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-17-5p, mediating the expression of PTEN. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a radiotherapy dose-limiting toxicity for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Prior studies have proposed relevant dosimetric constraints to limit this toxicity. Using machine learning algorithms, we performed analyses of contributing factors in the development of RP to uncover previously unidentified criteria and elucidate the relative importance of individual factors. Materials and methods: We evaluated 32 clinical features per patient in a cohort of 203 stage II–III LA-NSCLC patients treated with definitive chemoradiation to a median dose of 66.6 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions at our institution from 2008 to 2016. Of this cohort, 17.7% of patients developed grade ≥2 RP. Univariate analysis was performed using trained decision stumps to individually analyze statistically significant predictors of RP and perform feature selection. Applying Random Forest, we performed multivariate analysis to assess the combined performance of important predictors of RP. Results: On univariate analysis, lung V20, lung mean, lung V10 and lung V5 were found to be significant RP predictors with the greatest balance of specificity and sensitivity. On multivariate analysis, Random Forest (AUC = 0.66, p = 0.0005) identified esophagus max (20.5%), lung V20 (16.4%), lung mean (15.7%) and pack-year (14.9%) as the most common primary differentiators of RP. Conclusions: We highlight Random Forest as an accurate machine learning method to identify known and new predictors of symptomatic RP. Furthermore, this analysis confirms the importance of lung V20, lung mean and pack-year as predictors of RP while also introducing esophagus max as an important RP predictor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: A growing number of microRNAs have been proved to play significant roles in limiting tumor growth and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Present work aims to study the function of microRNA (miR)-105 in EMT of NSCLC cells, which is unrevealed yet. Methods: Two NSCLC cell lines A549 and Calu-3 were transfected with miR-105 mimic, inhibitor, or scrambled control. And then the effects of miR-105 were evaluated by performing trypan blue staining, transwell assay, ANNEXIN-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and Western blot analysis. The expression levels of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) after transfection were tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Whether Mcl-1 was a downstream effector of miR-105, and the involvement of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) signaling pathways were assessed. Results: The overexpression of miR-105 significantly increased the viability and migration of A549 and Calu-3, but had no impacts on cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, E-cadherin was remarkably downregulated, and N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1, and Snail were upregulated by miR-105 overexpression. Mcl-1 was positively regulated by miR-105, and the effects of miR-105 overexpression on A549 and Calu-3 cells viability, migration and EMT were all flattened by Mcl-1 silence. Both mTOR and p38MAPK pathways were activated in miR-105-overexpressing and Mcl-1-overexpressing cells. Besides, inhibition of mTOR and p38MAPK pathways by using Rapamycin and VX-702 abolished the regulatory effects of Mcl-1 on EMT. Conclusion: Our study underlines the importance of miR-105 in modulating NSCLC cells EMT. miR-105 promoted the EMT of NSCLC cells possibly via upregulation of Mcl-1 and thereby activation of mTOR and p38MAPK signaling. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is a kind of thyroid cancer and frequently presents with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were previously reported to be associated with PTC. Thus, this study aims to define the role of microRNA-520a-3p (miR-520a-3p) in PTC through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by targeting JAK1. The PTC and normal thyroid tissues of 137 PTC patients were collected. First of all, the expression pattern of miR-520a-3p, JAK1, JAK2, STAT3, E-cadherin, and vimentin in PTC was identified. The relationship between miR-520a-3p and JAK1 was predicted and analyzed. And a series of miR-520a-3p mimic or inhibitor, or siRNA JAK1 introduced into PTC cells were applied to examine the effect of miR-520a-3p on PTC cell viability, migration, invasion, cell cycle, apoptosis, and EMT. Meanwhile, the regulatory effect of miR-520a-3p and JAK1 on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was also determined. The expression of JAK1, JAK2, STAT3, and vimentin increased yet miR-520a-3p and E-cadherin decreased in PTC tissue. JAK1 was negatively regulated by miR-520a-3p. Functionally, EMT induction was prevented by miR-520a-3p upregulation through downregulating JAK1. When upregulating miR-520a-3p or silencing JAK1 in PTC cells, PTC cell viability, migration, and invasion were inhibited yet cell apoptosis promoted with cells arrested at G1 phase, indicating that miR-520a-3p prevented PTC progression by downregulating JAK1. Moreover, miR-520a-3p elevation or JAK1 inhibition inactivated the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Collectively, miR-520a-3p prevents cancer progression through inactivating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by downregulating JAK1 in PTC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The clinical relevance and prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as an interplay between malignant cells and immune function has been known for decades. On contrary, this potential may be different by T lymphocytes subsets endowed with a different function. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease with different suggested prognostic biomarkers. So, this study was conducted to examine the prognostic value of CD8+ TILs on the survival rate of CRC as an independent factor of oncogenetic tumor features. Methods: With respect to this, 281 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of Iranian CRC patients were evaluated for clinical features including tumor location, tumor stage, differentiation grade, and mucinous characteristics. Then, using the standard immunohistochemical technique, tumor sections were examined, and CD8+ TILs were counted and identified in two regions of the tumor, including intratumoral (ITCIL TILs) and stromal (S TILs). The prognostic value of CD8+ TILs was determined by comparing with parameters, such as diagnostic age, tumor stage, adjuvant therapy, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, KRAS and BRAF mutations, family history, and survival. Results: The presence of intratumoral tumor cell-infiltrating lymphocytes (ITCIL) CD8+ lymphocytes are significantly associated with differentiation (p = 0.004), tumor, node, and metastases (TNM) stage (p = 0.001), and MSI (p = 0.001). Meanwhile, based on the level of stromal infiltrating lymphocytes (SIL) infiltration, analysis of CRC patients was statistically associated with a location (p = 0.002), TNM stage (p &lt; 0.001), metastasis (p &lt; 0.001), and KRAS mutation (p = 0.031). Also, tumors with severe ITCIL CD8+ lymphocytes have a good prognosis compared with tumors with poor or moderate ITCIL CD8+ lymphocytes. Conclusions: These results suggest that intratumor cell-infiltrating CD8− T lymphocytes as an independent prognostic factor that have an antitumor activity as judged by their favorable effect on patients’ survival and could potentially be exploited in the treatment of CRC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Systems for magnetic resonance (MR-) guided radiotherapy enable daily MR imaging of cancer patients during treatment, which is of interest for treatment response monitoring and biomarker discovery using quantitative MRI (qMRI). Here, the performance of a 1.5 T MR-linac regarding qMRI was assessed on phantoms. Additionally, we show the feasibility of qMRI in a prostate cancer patient on this system for the first time. Materials and methods: Four 1.5 T MR-linac systems from four institutes were included in this study. T 1 and T 2 relaxation times, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, as well as dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) images were acquired. Bland–Altman statistics were used, and accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility were determined. Results: Median accuracy for T 1 ranged over the four systems from 2.7 to 14.3%, for T 2 from 10.4 to 14.1%, and for ADC from 1.9 to 2.7%. For DCE images, the accuracy ranged from 12.8 to 35.8% for a gadolinium concentration of 0.5 mM and deteriorated for higher concentrations. Median short-term repeatability for T 1 ranged from 0.6 to 5.1%, for T 2 from 0.4 to 1.2%, and for ADC from 1.3 to 2.2%. DCE acquisitions showed a coefficient of variation of 0.1–0.6% in the signal intensity. Long-term repeatability was 1.8% for T 1 , 1.4% for T 2 , 1.7% for ADC, and 17.9% for DCE. Reproducibility was 11.2% for T 1 , 2.9% for T 2 , 2.2% for ADC, and 18.4% for DCE. Conclusion: These results indicate that qMRI on the Unity MR-linac is feasible, accurate, and repeatable which is promising for treatment response monitoring and treatment plan adaptation based on daily qMRI. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: High fat diet (HFD) and its responsive change of gut microbiota are associated with numerous diseases in human and animal studies. But how maternal and post-weaning HFD may influence the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer (PCa) in male offspring has not yet been reported. Methods: We studied both solitary and combined effects of maternal or/and post-weaning HFD on the tumorigenesis of prostate in offspring using a transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. TRAMP male mice (n = 24) were born to and fostered onto control diet or HFD-fed mothers, the weaned pups were further fed control or fat diet. All mice were sacrificed at the 28th week. The prostate histopathology was performed. The gut microbiota was analyzed by fecal 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, and the serum metabolites were determined by LC-MS/MS. Results: Our results indicated that post-weaning HFD could significantly promote the PCa tumorigenesis in offspring (P = 0.031), and similar results were found in maternal HFD group but with no significant differences (P = 0.056). However, combined maternal and post-weaning HFD could significantly reduce the PCa tumorigenesis in offspring (P = 0.019). Significant differences in specific microbial populations and serum metabolites were observed across groups. For example, mice with combined maternal and post-weaning HFD had higher abundance of gut Lachonospiraceae, Roseburia, and Amycolatopsis, increased serum L-methionine (P = 0.0052), and decreased serum α-linolenic acid (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study highlights the inhibitory effects of combined maternal and post-weaning HFD on PCa tumorigenesis, and provides new insights into the interactions between diet, gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and PCa. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of p16/Ki-67 dual staining in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 or worse (CIN2+/CIN3+) in Chinese women. Methods Cervical exfoliated cells were collected from 537 eligible women and were used for liquid-based cytology (LBC), p16/Ki-67 dual staining, and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. All women received colposcopy with biopsies taken at abnormal sites. Histopathological diagnoses were used as the gold standard. Results p16/Ki-67 staining had a positivity rate of 43.58% overall; the rate increased significantly with histological severity (p <0.001). The sensitivities of p16/ki-67 for detecting CIN2+ and CIN3+ were 88.10% and 91.30%, respectively. Compared with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV), sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 was lower for detecting CIN2+ (88.10% versus 95.71%), but similar for detecting CIN3+ (91.30% versus 96.27%). Specificities of p16/Ki-67 were 85.02% for detecting CIN2+ and 76.86% for detecting CIN3+, values similar to those for LBC (84.71% for CIN2+, 80.05% for CIN3+) but higher than those for HR-HPV (62.77% for CIN2+, 71.25% for CIN3+). All the tests performed better in women>30 years. With respect to the performance of triage for women with ASC-US, sensitivities of p16/Ki-67 were 86.36% for detecting CIN2+ and 83.33% for detecting CIN3+, values similar to those of HR-HPV. However, specificities of p16/Ki-67 were both higher than those of HR-HPV (85.96% versus 67.54% for CIN2+, 79.84% versus 62.90% for CIN3+). Conclusion P16/Ki-67 dual staining could probably provide an optional method for China's national cervical cancer screening, and could also be considered as an efficient method of triage for managing women with ASC-US. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapy of East Coast fever, a lymphoproliferative cancer-like disease of cattle causing significant economic losses in Africa, is largely dependent on the use of buparvaquone, a drug that was developed in the late 1980's. The disease is caused by the tick-borne protozoan pathogen Theileria parva. Buparvaquone can be used prophylactically and it is also active against tropical theileriosis, caused by the related parasite Theileria annulata. Recently, drug resistance was reported in T. annulata, and could occur in T. parva. Using a 3 H-thymidine incorporation assay we screened 796 open source compounds from the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) to discover novel chemicals with potential inhibitory activity to T. parva. We identified nine malaria box compounds and eight pathogen box compounds that inhibited the proliferation of F100TpM, a T. parva infected lymphocyte cell line. However, only two compounds, MMV008212 and MMV688372 represent promising leads with IC 50 values of 0.78 and 0.61 μM, respectively, and CC 50 values &gt; 5 μM. The remaining compounds exhibited a high degree of toxicity (CC 50 values &lt; 1.09 μM) on the proliferation of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with concanavalin A. We also tested the anti-cancer drug, dasatinib, used in the chemotherapy of some leukemias. Dasatinib was as active and safe as buparvaquone in vitro, with an IC 50 of 5 and 4.2 nM, respectively, and CC 50 &gt; 10 μM. Our preliminary data suggest that it may be possible to repurpose compounds from the cancer field as well as MMV as novel anti-T. parva molecules. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Beta-carotene (BC), a red-colored pigment found in plants and animals, is one of the most extensively investigated carotenoids due to its provitamin-A, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. The anticancer activity of BC through oral administration is severely affected due to its low bioavailability and oxidative degradation. The present study aimed to formulate and characterize solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of BC for enhanced bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Beta-carotene-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (BC-SLNs) were prepared employing different combinations of glyceryl monostearate and gelucire. The characterization studies were performed for particle size, morphology, release behavior, and stability. BC-SLNs were also studied for in vitro cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) and pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats. The cytotoxicity studies confirmed that encapsulation of BC within the lipid bilayers of nanoparticles did not affect its anticancer efficacy. An improved anticancer activity was observed in BC-SLNs as compared to the free BC. BC-SLNs enhanced the bioavailability of BC on oral administration by sustaining its release from the lipid core and prolongation of circulation time in the body. Similarly, area under the curve (AUC total ) enhanced 1.92-times more when BC was incorporated into SLNs as compared to free BC. In conclusion, solid lipid nanoparticles could be an effective and promising strategy to improve the biopharmaceutical properties of carotenoids for anticancer effects. © 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are attractive biomarkers and therapeutic targets because of their disease- and stage-restricted expression. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 17 (SNHG17) belongs to a large family of noncoding genes hosting small RNAs, with its expression pattern and biological function not clarified in gastric cancer (GC). Thus, we conducted this study to investigate the functional significance and the underlying mechanisms of SNHG17 in GC progression. Our results showed that SNHG17 expression was upregulated in GC tissues and cells, and its high expression was significantly correlated with increased invasion depth, lymphatic metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. The expression of plasma SNHG17 was also found upregulated in patients with GC compared with healthy controls, with a moderate accuracy for diagnosis of GC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.748; 95% CI, 0.666–0.830). Gain- and loss-of-function of SNHG17 revealed that SNHG17 promoted GC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, invasion, and migration and inhibited apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations showed that SNHG17 was associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 and that this association was required for epigenetic repression of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors, including p15 and p57, thus contributing to the regulation of GC cell cycle and proliferation. Furthermore, rescue experiments indicated that SNHG17 functioned as an oncogene via activating enhancer of zeste homolog 2 in GC cells. Our study provides a new perspective for SNHG17 acting as a noncoding oncogene in GC tumorigenesis, and it may serve as a novel early diagnostic marker and potential target for the treatment of GC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Oesophageal mobility relative to bony anatomy is a major source of geometrical uncertainty in proton radiotherapy of oesophageal carcinoma. To mitigate this uncertainty we investigated the use of implanted fiducial markers for direct target verification in terms of safety, visibility, and stability. Materials and methods: A total of 19 helical gold markers were endoscopically implanted in ten patients. Their placement at the proximal and distal tumour borders was compared to tumour demarcations derived from [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, their visibility quantified via the contrast-to-noise ratio on daily orthogonal X-ray imaging, and their mobility relative to bony anatomy analysed by means of retrospective triangulation. Results: Marker implantation proceeded without complications, but the distal tumour border could not be reached in two patients. Marker locations corresponded reasonably well with metabolic tumour edges (mean: 5.4 mm more distally). Marker visibility was limited but mostly sufficient (mean contrast-to-noise ratio: 1.5), and sixteen markers (84%) remained in situ until the end of treatment. Overall, marker excursions from their planned position were larger than 5(10) mm in 59(17)% of all analysed fractions. On one occasion severe target displacement was only identified via markers and was corrected before treatment delivery. Conclusion: Implanted helical gold fiducial markers are a safe and reliable method of providing target-centric positioning verification in proton beam therapy of oesophageal carcinoma. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA-340 (miR-340) was considered as a tumor suppressor by affecting cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration, and was downregulated in diverse cancers. Moreover, dysregulation of miR-340 was also found to be associated with drug resistance and predicted patients’ survival in various cancers. Herein, we investigated miR-340 expression and its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect miR-340 expression in bone marrow (BM) from 99 newly diagnosed AML patients except for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), 19 AML patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 29 healthy donors. BM miR-340 expression was significantly underexpressed in newly diagnosed AML patients as compared with controls (p = 0.031) and AML patients achieved CR (p = 0.025). No significant differences were observed between miR-340 expression and most of the clinicopathologic features (p > 0.05). However, low miR-340 expression was found to be associated with lower CR rate in both non-APL-AML and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML; p = 0.001 and 0.031, respectively), and acted as an independent risk factor for CR by logistic regression analysis (p = 0.001 and 0.021, respectively). More important, among both non-APL-AML and CN-AML, low expression of miR-340 was also associated with shorter overall survival (OS; p = 0.013 and 0.005, respectively), and was further validated by Cox regression (p = 0.031 and 0.039, respectively). Collectively, our study showed that BM miR-340 expression was downregulated in AML, and low expression of miR-340 correlated with adverse prognosis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Gastric cancer is a major global health threat and is often related with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. FRA-1 is a subunit of the activator protein-1 transcription factor complex, which played a central role in cell proliferation and migration. It has also been implicated in stomach inflammation and malignancy. The present study aimed to clarify the relationship between H. pylori infection and production of FRA-1 in controlling cell proliferation and migration and its molecular mechanisms. Cell proliferation was measured by colony formation assay. Cell migration was monitored by transwell migration assay. Gastric mucosal epithelial cells were treated with FRA-1-specific siRNA with or without H. pylori infection in vitro, and RNA and proteins were extracted. The expression of FRA-1 and indicators in cells was determined by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. β-Catenin and TGF-β activities were then assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. The expression of FRA-1 increased after H. pylori infection. Additional analysis identified that knockdown of FRA-1 attenuated the H. pylori-induced proliferative activity and migration of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, upregulation of FRA-1 by H. pylori led to increase in Wnt/β-Catenin levels and TGF-β dependent signaling events. These results demonstrate that the upregulation of FRA-1 in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells plays a key role in the carcinogenic process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: In this retrospective study, we investigated the impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT (PSMA PET-CT) upon the treatment plan and therapeutic response obtained for Prostate Cancer (PCa) patients presenting an occult biochemical recurrence. Methods: Forty-two patients with previously negative or doubtful 18F-Choline (FCH) were enrolled. PET images were recorded 1 h after injection of tracer. Only a few months after treatment ended, a PSA assay was requested to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment based on PSMA results. Results: PSMA—positive lesions were detected in 34/42 (80.9%) patients. Detection rates were 85.7% and 89.3% for serum PSA levels lower than 2 ng/mL, and &gt;2 ng/mL, respectively. One hundred seventy-three lesions were detected: 132/173 in lymph nodes (76.3%), 22/173 as metastatic sites (bone or lung) (12.7%), and 19/173 in the prostate bed (10.9%). As a result of the PSMA PET-CT, therapeutic management changed in 31/42 patients (73.8%). With a follow-up of 4.9 ± 2.27 months, 32/42 (76.2%) PSA assays after treatment guided by PSMA PET-CT were collected. For 37.5% (12/32) of patients, the serum PSA level was lower than 0.2 ng/mL and a PSA decrease of over 50% in 8 (25.0%) other patients were obtained. Conclusion: Performing a PSMA PET-CT when FCH PET-CT was doubtful or negative allows the recurrence localization in more 80% of patients and this had a major clinical impact, as it resulted in treatment change in more than 70% of patients as well as a significant decrease in PSA levels in more than 60% of them. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Mutational profiling is recommended for selecting targeted therapy and predicting prognosis of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Detection of coexisting mutations within the same pathway, which are usually mutually exclusive, raises the concern for potential laboratory errors. In this retrospective study for quality assessment of a next-generation sequencing assay, we examined BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS genes within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the PIK3CA gene within the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (mTOR) pathway in 744 CRC specimens submitted to our clinical diagnostics laboratory. Although coexistence of mutations between the MAPK and mTOR pathways was observed, it rarely occurred within the MAPK pathway. Retrospective quality assessments identified false detection of coexisting activating KRAS and NRAS mutations in 1 specimen and confirmed 2 activating KRAS mutations in 2 specimens and coexisting activating KRAS and NRAS mutations in 2 specimens, but no coexisting activating RAS and BRAF mutations. There were 15 CRCs with a kinase-impaired BRAF mutation, including 3 with a coexisting activating KRAS mutation, which may have therapeutic implications. Multiregional analysis based on different histologic features demonstrated that coexisting KRAS and NRAS mutations may be present in the same or different tumor populations and showed that invasion of adenomas by synchronous adenocarcinomas of different clonal origin may result in detection of coexisting mutations within the MAPK pathway. In this study, we proposed an operating procedure for clinical validation of unexpected coexisting mutations. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the biological significance and clinical implications of coexisting mutations within the MAPK pathway. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is prevalent among populations from southern China and is influenced by both genetic and environmental risk factors. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a member of cysteine-cysteine chemokine family, plays critical roles in cancers. A polymorphism within the MCP-1 promoter, rs1024611, has been shown to be significantly associated with the risk of several cancers. Our purpose was to assess the role of rs1024611 in NPC susceptibility. By polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method, we genotyped rs1024611 in 593 patients with NPC (cases) and 480 cancer-free subjects (controls) among Guangxi population from southern China. We observed that the G allele of rs1024611 was significantly associated with the increased risk of NPC in an additive model and dominant model, respectively (P = 0.018 and 0.010, odds ratio = 1.25 and 1.41, respectively). No appreciable variation of the effects was found across the subgroups stratified by age, sex, nationality, smoking and drinking status, and smoking level. In addition, significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) expression level of MCP-1 was observed in NPC tissues than that in normal nasopharyngeal tissues, and the G allele of rs1024611 was significantly associated with elevated mRNA expression level of MCP-1 in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes. In conclusion, our findings suggested that rs1024611 at the MCP-1 promoter may be a risk factor for NPC. Further studies with larger sample size are necessary to confirm these findings. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "We report on the synthesis of edge-controlled and highly fluorescent few-layer graphene quantum dots (GQDs) using different solvents and explore their application in the confocal imaging of cancer cells. TEM and AFM imaging analysis reveal that GQDs of sizes in the range 5–8 nm and few-layer (1–4) thickness were grown using DMF, DMSO, and water as solvents. Micro-Raman analysis reveals that GQDs grown with DMF possess primarily the armchair edges, while that grown with water contains primarily the zigzag edges. The nature of oxygen functional groups on the edge/in-plane sites of carbon atoms was elucidated through thermogravimetric and FTIR analyses. The GQDs containing high density of armchair edges and oxygen functional group defects exhibited high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (∼32%). The time-resolved PL measurements suggest the charge transfer from the GQDs to the surrounding dielectric medium. Further, we explore the high PL quantum yield of GQDs in bio-imaging of A-375 and HeLa cancer cells. The cell viability of GQDs on A-375 cells was found to be considerably higher than that of HeLa cells at a GQD concentration of 44.4 µg/mL, which is very significant. Our results indicate the GQD edge site dependent cell viability, for the first time. These results will be useful for the development of highly fluorescent GQDs with specific edge structure and their exploration in the field of bio-imaging, bio-sensing, and drug delivery applications. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a lethal gynecologic tumor, which brings its mortality to the head. CXCL12 and its receptor chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) have been found to be highly expressed in OC and contribute to the disease progression by affecting tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Here, in this study, we aim to explore whether the blockade of CXCL12–CXCR4 axis with AMD3100 (a selective CXCR4 antagonist) has effects on the progression of OC. On the basis of the gene expression omnibus database of OC gene expression chips, the OC differentially expressed genes were screened by microarray analysis. OC (nonmetastatic and metastatic) and normal ovarian tissues were collected to determine the expressions of CXCL12 and CXCR4. A series of AMD3100, shRNA against CXCR4, and pCNS-CXCR4 were introduced to treat CAOV3 cells with the highest CXCR4 was assessed. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were all evaluated. The microarray analysis screened out the differential expression of CXCL12–CXCR4 in OC. CXCL12 and CXCR4 expressions were increased in OC tissues, particularly in the metastatic OC tissues. Downregulation of CXCR4 by AMD3100 or shRNA was observed to have a critical role in inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of the CAOV3 OC cell line while promoting cell apoptosis. Overexpressed CXCR4 brought significantly promoting effects on the proliferation and invasiveness of OC cells. These results reinforce that the blockade of CXCL12–CXCR4 axis with AMD3100 inhibits the growth of OC cells. The antitumor role of the inhibition of CXCL12–CXCR4 axis offers a preclinical validation of CXCL12–CXCR4 axis as a therapeutic target in OC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare hematopoietic malignancy. Treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMA) was introduced between 2004 and 2006 but its impact on population-based survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological characteristics and survival before and after introduction of HMA treatment. Methods: We performed a population-based analysis of CMML cases reported to the Cantonal Cancer Registries in Switzerland (SWISS) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from the United States for 1999–2006 (before HMA) and 2007–2014 (after HMA). Time trends were compared for these two time periods. Results: 423 and 4144 new CMML cases were reported to the SWISS and SEER registries, respectively. We observed an increasing proportion of older patients ≥75 years in the SWISS (50.3%–62.3%) compared to a decreasing one in the SEER population (59.1%–55.1%). Age standardized incidence-rates were similar and remained stable in both countries (0.32–0.38 per 100’000 py). Relative survival (RS) improved significantly in the SEER (3 years 27%–37%; 5 years 19%–23%; p < 0.001 for both) but remained stable in the SWISS population (3 years 48% to 40%; 5 years 34% to 26%; n.s. for both). Conclusions: With the exception of opposing age-trends, epidemiologic characteristics are similar in both countries and comparable to other population-based registries. RS remains poor and different time trends of population-based survival cannot be faithfully explained by HMA but most likely by changes in diagnostic accuracy within prognostically distinct age-groups. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Recently, targeted agents were reported to improve overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), response rate, and quality of life compared with cytotoxic chemotherapies, which provides hope for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The network meta-analysis is applied to compare the efficacies and adverse events of five targeted agents (erlotinib, gefitinib, vandetanib, dacomitinib, and icotinib) for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Nine eligible randomized controlled trials from PubMed and Cochrane Library database were included. Weighted mean difference, odds ratio, and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values were evaluated for the efficacy and adverse events of the five targeted agents in the treatment of NSCLC. With regard to efficacy, the overall response rate (ORR) of advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib was relatively higher than those treated with placebo. Compared with patients treated with placebo, the disease control rate (DCR) of patients treated with erlotinib and with gefitinib was relatively higher. Furthermore, in terms of PFS and DCR, the SUCRA value of icotinib was the highest among the five targeted drugs. With regard to ORR, the SUCRA value of gefitinib was the highest among the five targeted drugs. In terms of fatigue, rash, and cough, erlotinib had the lowest SUCRA value, whereas vandetanib exhibited the lowest SUCRA value in terms of diarrhea. Our study suggests that the efficacies of gefitinib and icotinib for advanced or metastatic NSCLC were comparatively better, whereas the toxicities of erlotinib and vandetanib were relatively greater. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Exposure to energy restriction during childhood is associated with a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). To date, the association between this critical period of growth and prognosis of CRC has rarely been investigated. Changes in microbiota and epigenetic dysregulation may be key underlying mechanisms. Methodology: Tissues collected from patients born between 1956 and 1964 were grouped based on time-period. The differences in overall survival among patients from the three time-periods were examined via univariate analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach was to determine differences in microbiota among the groups. Samples were randomly selected to detect BRAF mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI) and promoter CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status. The chi-square test was to assess the relationship between alterations in these molecules and microbiota differences. Results: Patients from the three groups differed in terms of location of CRC (P = 0.034) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P = 0.036). A survival advantage was observed in the famine group compared with the other two groups. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli were more abundant in the two comparing groups. Abundance of B. fragilis was associated with BRAF mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI) and abundance of E. coli. Moreover, the incidence of CIMP and MSI was higher in patients with greater abundance of F. nucleatum. Conclusions: Limitation of energy intake during childhood may affect the composition of gut microbiota, resulting in persistent epigenetic changes that subsequently influence the prognosis of patients with CRC. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Breast impalpable lesions have become a clinical dilemma because they are small, presenting a heterogeneous cellular phenotype. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mutational profile of the PIK3CA, TP53, and CDKN2A genes, comparing the mammary tissue with the respective circulating free DNA (cfDNA). The PIK3CA, TP53, and CDKN2A genes were sequenced (PCR-Sanger) in 58 women with impalpable lesions (49 malignant and 9 benign) with the respective cfDNA. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate statistical significance between the clinical variables and mutational profile. A total of 51 out of 58 samples generated successful mutation profiles in both breast lesion and cfDNA. Of the 37 mutations detected, 10 (27%) and 16 (43%) mutations were detected in benign and malignant breast lesions, respectively, while 2 (5%) and 9 (24%) were found in cfDNA of women with benign and malignant lesions, respectively. The lymph node involvement with mutations in the PIK3CA in malignant lesions (P = 0.001), and the relationship between mutations in PIK3CA, comparing ductal tumors with benign lesions (P = 0.05), were statistically significant. This study detected different mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, and CDKN2A genes, which represent, in part, the heterogeneity of impalpable lesions. The results confirm that more studies should be conducted on the functional role of cfDNA in the impalpable lesions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSC) with low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are resistant to conventional chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is a redox regulatory protein that plays a key role in maintaining ROS homeostasis in the tumor microenvironment. However, despite the role of Prx2 in ROS-mediated signal transduction, the association of Prx2 with stemness via ROS in CSC has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we investigated the link between Prx2 and CSC stemness through regulation of ROS levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. ROS induced CSC stemness reduction and downregulated stem cell markers in Huh7 and SK-HEP1 cells. Prx2 knockdown decreased CSC sphere formation and expression of stem cell makers with increasing intracellular ROS levels. This effect was reversed by the ROS scavengers NAC and GSH in Prx2 knockdown cells. Conversely, we found that Prx2 overexpression promotes CSC stemness and the peroxidase activity of Prx2 is essential for CSC stemness using peroxidase inactive mutant, Prx2 C51/172S . More importantly, the hyperoxidation-resistant mutant (Prx2 ΔYF ), which has a constant ROS scavenging activity even at high concentrations of ROS, increased the CSC stemness and expression of stem cell markers more than Prx2 WT under oxidative stress. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Prx2 links ROS homeostasis to CSC stemness; Prx2 is a mediator between ROS homeostasis and CSC stemness. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are frequently detected in indoor environment at high levels, posing health risks to humans. However, the potential cytotoxicity mediated by OPFRs and BFRs in relevant human cell models is limited. In current study, non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell was employed to investigate toxicity mechanisms of typical OPFRs (i.e., tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris-(2-chloropropyl) phosphate (TCPP), tricresy phosphate (TCP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and BFRs (i.e., 2,2’,4,4’-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), 3,3’ 5,5’-tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA)). It was found that BDE-47 exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity, followed by TBBPA, TPHP, TCP, TCPP and TCEP. OPFRs and BFRs could cause the reduction of cell viability of A549 cell in both dose- and time-dependent manner after exposure for 24 and 48 h. Simultaneously, excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dysfunction, cell apoptosis and overload of intracellular free Ca 2+ demonstrated that cytotoxicity induced by OPFRs and BFRs were mediated by oxidative stress. Of note, the survival rate of cell significantly increased when pretreated with Ac-DEVD-CHO, suggesting that caspase-3 dependent mitochondrial pathway may have played a primary role in the process of A549 cell apoptosis. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The utility of a prediction model depends on its generalizability to patients drawn from different but related populations. We explored whether a semi-supervised learning model could improve the generalizability of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk prediction relative to supervised learning methods. Data on 113,141 patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic CRC from 2004 to 2012 were obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology End Results registry for model development, and data on 1149 patients from the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2011, were collected for generalizability testing. A clinical prediction model for CRC survival risk using a semi-supervised logistic regression method was developed and validated to investigate the model discrimination, calibration, generalizability, interpretability and clinical usefulness. Rigorous model performance comparisons with other supervised learning models were performed. The area under the curve of the logistic membership model revealed a large heterogeneity between the development cohort and validation cohort, which is typical of generalizability studies of prediction models. The discrimination was good for all models. Calibration was poor for supervised learning models, while the semi-supervised logistic regression model exhibited a good calibration on the validation cohort, which indicated good generalizability. Clinical usefulness analysis showed that semi-supervised logistic regression can lead to better clinical outcomes than supervised learning methods. These results increase our current understanding of the generalizability of different models and provide a reference for predictive model development for clinical decision-making. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Abl1 is a protein tyrosine kinase whose aberrant activation due to mutations is the culprit of several cancers, most notably chronic myeloid leukaemia. Several Abl1 inhibitors are used as anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, drug resistance limits their effectiveness. The main cause for drug resistance is mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of Abl1 that evolve in patients. The T315I mutation confers resistance against all clinically-available inhibitors except ponatinib. Resistance to ponatinib can develop by compound (double) mutations. Methods: Kinetic measurements of the KD of Abl1 and its mutants were carried out to examine their catalytic activity. Specifically, mutants that lead to drug resistance against ponatinib were considered. Molecular dynamics simulations and multiple sequence analysis were used for explanation of the experimental findings. Results: The catalytic efficiency of the T315I pan-resistance mutant is more than two times lower than that of the native KD. All ponatinib resistant mutations restore the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Two of them (G250E/T315I and Y253H/E255V) have a catalytic efficiency that is more than five times that of the native KD. Conclusions: The measurements and analysis suggest that resistance is at least partially due to the development of a highly efficient kinase through subsequent mutations. The simulations highlight modifications in two structurally important regions of Abl1, the activation and phosphate binding loops, upon mutations. General significance: Experimental and computational methods were used together to explain how mutations in the kinase domain of Abl1 lead to resistance against the most advanced drug currently in use to treat chronic myeloid leukaemia. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Momordin Ic was previously found to induce liver cancer cell apoptosis and autophagy. To further elucidate the anti-cancer activity of Momordin Ic, we analyzed the suppressive effects of Momordin Ic on cell migration and invasion. We also investigated the mechanisms associated with MMP-9, adhesion molecules and signaling transductions. The results demonstrated that Momordin Ic effectively prevented cell attachment, migration and invasion. E-cadherin, mediation of homotypic adhesion was induced while VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 and MMP-9 were inhibited. Momordin Ic influenced phosphorylations of p38, JNK and Erk with VEGF. p38 effectively regulated expressions of E-cadherin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. JNK greatly contributed to E-cadherin alteration. Erk hardly modified E-cadherin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and MMP-9 although Erk phosphorylation decreased by Momordin Ic. These results revealed Momordin Ic prevent cell invasion by inhibiting VCAM-1, ICAM-1, MMP-9 but inducing E-cadherin expression via p38 and JNK pathways. Thus momordin Ic may be a promising candidate with anti-cancer bioactivity. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: Little is known regarding risk factors for chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN) in pediatric patients. Procedure: A secondary analysis was conducted of a previously published multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trial assessing the efficacy of acupressure in preventing CIN in pediatric patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The primary outcome was nausea severity, self-reported using the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool. The relationships between acute and delayed nausea severity and patient- (sex, race, age, and cancer diagnosis) and treatment-related (chemotherapy, antiemetic prophylaxis, CIN, and vomiting control) factors were analyzed by a proportional odds generalized estimating equation approach. The acute phase started with administration of the first and continued for 24 hours after the last chemotherapy dose. The delayed phase started at the end of the acute phase and continued until the next chemotherapy block (maximum seven days). Results: In the acute and delayed phases, 165 and 144 patients provided data for analysis, respectively. Nonwhite race was significantly associated with higher acute phase nausea severity (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.6). Poor CIN control in the acute phase (OR, 16; 95% CI, 4.0–64.6), diagnosis of a cancer other than a central nervous system (CNS) tumor (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2–5.3), and cisplatin administration (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.1–6.0) were significantly associated with higher delayed phase nausea severity. Conclusion: Acute phase CIN was associated with nonwhite race. Delayed phase CIN was associated with poor acute phase CIN control, diagnosis of non-CNS cancer, and receipt of cisplatin. These findings will inform future antiemetic trial design. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of cancer and central nervous system (CNS) tumors endure major life disruptions with their diagnosis, treatment, and the burden of emerging learning difficulties. Survivors and their parents often struggle to obtain more academic support as survivors transition through school. This study explored the knowledge and experience survivors and their parents need as they progress through school to college. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined childhood cancer and CNS tumor survivors, aged 11 to 21 years, with a known learning difficulty (Individual Education Plan, 504 Plan) and their parents. We assessed participants’ knowledge of and experience with transition planning for postsecondary education and independent living. Results: Ninety-two AYA survivors and parents (45 survivors, 47 parents) completed the survey. High school–aged survivors described their learning difficulties better than middle school–aged survivors. Survivors estimated their abilities higher than did their parents. Despite a majority of survivors expecting to attend college, 68.5% of survivors and 57.9% of parents were not certain how to get special accommodations for standardized college entrance exams. Only 20.8% of survivors were aware of what a transition plan includes. Parents understood the transition planning process and when it should begin better than the students (P = 0.001), but many parents (40.0%) were still unsure. Conclusions: AYA survivors and parents lack knowledge necessary to successfully transition to their goals after high school. Greater education is needed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Regorafenib is approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the trial NCT02466802, we have discovered that regorafenib can be safely combined with the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil in advanced solid tumor patients. The present studies determined whether the approved ERBB1/2/4 and RAS downregulating drug neratinib, could enhance the lethality of [regorafenib + sildenafil]. Neratinib enhanced [regorafenib + sildenafil] lethality in a greater than additive fashion in colon cancer cells. The drug combination reduced the expression of mutant K-RAS and of multiple histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins that required autophagosome formation. It caused green fluorescent protein or red fluorescent protein–tagged forms of K-RAS V12 to localize into large intracellular vesicles. Compared with [regorafenib + sildenafil], the three-drug combination caused greater and more prolonged activation of the ATM-AMPK-ULK-1 pathway and caused a greater suppression and prolonged inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin, AKT, and p70 S6K. Approximately 70% of enhanced lethality caused by neratinib required ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)–AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) signaling whereas knockdown of Beclin1, ATG5, FADD, and CD95 completely prevented the elevated killing effect. Exposure of cells to [regorafenib + sildenafil] reduced the expression of the checkpoint immunotherapy biomarkers programmed death-ligand 1, ornithine decarboxylase, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 and increased the expression of major histocompatibility complex A (MHCA), which also required autophagosome formation. Knockdown of specific HDAC proteins recapitulated the effects observed using chemical agents. In vivo, using mouse cancer models, neratinib significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of [regorafenib + sildenafil]. Our data support performing a new three drug Phase I trial combining regorafenib, sildenafil, and neratinib. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A series of spirochromenocarbazole tethered 1,2,3-triazoles were synthesized via click chemistry based one-pot, five component reaction between N-propargyl isatins, malononitrile, 4-hydroxycarbazole, aralkyl halides and sodium azide using cellulose supported CuI nanoparticles (Cell-CuI NPs) as the heterogeneous catalyst. Antiproliferative activity of all the synthesized compounds was investigated against panel of cancer cell lines such as MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, PANC-1, A-549, and THP-1. Many of the synthesized compounds exhibited good anti-proliferative activity against breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells with IC 50 values less than 10 μM. In case of MCF-7 cells, among the nine compounds that showed good anti-proliferative activity, compounds 6f and 6j were found to be highly potent (IC 50 = 2.13 μM and 4.80 μM, respectively). In case of MDA-MB-231, three compounds (6k, 6j and 6s) showed antiproliferative activity amongst which 6k was the most potent one (IC 50 = 3.78 μM). On the other hand, in cervical cancer HeLa cells, compounds 6b, 6g, 6s and 6u showed excellent antiproliferative activity (IC 50 = 4.05, 3.54, 3.83, 3.35 μM, respectively). All the compounds were found to be nontoxic to the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). AO and EtBr staining and fluorescence microscopy studies of the active compounds (IC 50 &lt; 5 μM) suggested that these compounds induce cell death by apoptosis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Deciphering the underlying genetic basis behind pancreatic cancer (PC) and its associated multimorbidities will enhance our knowledge toward PC control. The study investigated the common genetic background of PC and different morbidities through a computational approach and further evaluated the less explored association between PC and autoimmune diseases (AIDs) through an epidemiological analysis. Gene-disease associations (GDAs) of 26 morbidities of interest and PC were obtained using the DisGeNET public discovery platform. The association between AIDs and PC pointed by the computational analysis was confirmed through multivariable logistic regression models in the PanGen European case–control study population of 1,705 PC cases and 1,084 controls. Fifteen morbidities shared at least one gene with PC in the DisGeNET database. Based on common genes, several AIDs were genetically associated with PC pointing to a potential link between them. An epidemiologic analysis confirmed that having any of the nine AIDs studied was significantly associated with a reduced risk of PC (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58–0.93) which decreased in subjects having ≥2 AIDs (OR = 0.39, 95%CI 0.21–0.73). In independent analyses, polymyalgia rheumatica, and rheumatoid arthritis were significantly associated with low PC risk (OR = 0.40, 95%CI 0.19–0.89, and OR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.53–1.00, respectively). Several inflammatory-related morbidities shared a common genetic component with PC based on public databases. These molecular links could shed light into the molecular mechanisms underlying PC development and simultaneously generate novel hypotheses. In our study, we report sound findings pointing to an association between AIDs and a reduced risk of PC. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is thought to be one of the key components involved in the responses of tumor cells to chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to reveal the pathways and the phases of cisplatin-induced cell death that are characterized by changes of H 2 O 2 level. Methods: The genetically encoded cytosolic fluorescent sensor HyPer2 was used for flow cytometric analysis of the cisplatin-induced changes in H 2 O 2 level in HeLa Kyoto cells. Using a vital dye and the apoptotic markers PE Annexin V or TMRE the pathways and stages of cell death were investigated simultaneously with HyPer2 response. The H 2 O 2 level was studied separately in viable and early apoptotic cells after 12, 18, 24 h's incubation with cisplatin at several concentrations with or without the scavenger of reactive oxygen species NAC. Results: Cisplatin causes dose- and time-dependent increase of H 2 O 2 level in TMRE-positive and PE Annexin V-negative cancer cells. The scavenging of ROS by NAC decreased the H 2 O 2 level and restored cell viability. Conclusion: Н 2 О 2 generation begins in cells that have already lost mitochondrial membrane potential but have not yet externalized phosphatidylserine. Prevention of apoptosis by NAC confirmed the role of H 2 O 2 in apoptosis induction. General significance: This is the first time that the sensor HyPer2 has been used in parallel with apoptotic markers and vital dye to demonstrate the role of H 2 O 2 in different stages and types of tumor cell death under chemotherapeutic action. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The investigation of magnetic nanoparticles for medical and biological applications is relatively recent and steadily growing. When properly functionalized, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can target cancer cells and deliver a drug or heat to these cells. MNPs are being investigated in several applications in medicine such as hyperthermia, magnetic particle imaging, cell separation and magnetofection, in vitro and in vivo alternating current biosusceptibility, T1 and T2 magnetic resonance contrast agents, and magnetorelaxometry. In each of these applications, a specific physical property is measured. Magnetorelaxometry relies on the fact that when MNPs are magnetized they can relax by the Brownian and Néel mechanisms. Both mechanisms depend on the MNP size and for certain conditions can have a faster relaxation through the Brownian, compared to the Néel, mechanism. This can be exploited to target cells. For certain sizes, when an MNP is free to rotate in the biological fluids, they will relax faster than when attached to a cell. This can provide a high contrast for detection of magnetically-labelled cancer cells, making it possible to differentiate normal from cancer tissue. Until very recently SQUIDs were the main detectors employed to measure MNPs, but Optically Pumped Magnetometers (OPM) are now an attractive alternative. OPMs are smaller, do not need liquid helium, and are simpler to operate than SQUIDs. Here, we present the initial steps of the development of an OPM-based instrument to measure relaxation of MNP in vitro. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The study was aimed to investigate the influence of circ_0058063 on tumorigenesis as well as the regulatory mechanism of circ_0058063/miR-145-5p/ CDK6 pathway in bladder cancer (BC). Methods: Bioinformatics analysis was used to screen highly expressed circle RNA (circRNA) and search its downstream microRNA (miRNA) and protein. The expression level of circRNA, miRNA, and CDK6 in BC cell lines T24 and J82 were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Small interfering RNA was used to downregulate circ_0058063 expression. Cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis, and cell migration of T24 cells and J82 cells were detected through MTT assay, flow cytometry, and wound-healing assay, respectively. The relationships among miR-145-5p, circ_0058063, and CDK6 were confirmed through dual luciferase reporter assay. In vivo experiment was also performed to explore the impact of circ_0058063/miR-145-5p/ CDK6 pathway on tumorigenesis in BALB/c nude mice. Results: Circ_0058063 was significantly overexpressed in BC tissues. The downregulation of circ_0058063 impaired BC cell proliferation and migration ability but improved cell apoptosis ability. Circ_0058063 repressed miR-145-5p, which inhibited the expression of CDK6. Downregulation of circ_0058063 or miR-145-5p transfection contributed to more cells arresting in G0/G1 stage. MiR-145-5p suppressed cell growth and migration ability in BC, whereas CDK6 exerted the opposite influence on these cellular events. In vivo experiment also indicated that tumor development in BALB/c nude mice was repressed remarkably when circ_0058063 was downregulated. Conclusion: Circ_0058063 acted as a sponge of miR-145-5p to promote BC progression by regulating CDK6 expression, which provided some potential targets for BC treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In order to investigate the transfer and accumulation pathways of heavy metals in cropland ecosystems, an investigation of the geochemical behaviors of heavy metals in soil and rice plants was carried out in the Yangtze River Delta. Soil is one of the biggest reservoirs of heavy metals and affects food safety at the beginning of the food chain. The results of this study demonstrate that heavy metal levels in soil decreased with increasing soil pH, while rice shoots accumulated heavy metals more readily under low soil pH conditions. The non-carcinogenic hazard quotients (HQ) of heavy metals show that health risks for humans were primarily due to Pb and As. Furthermore, cancer risk (Risk) results suggested that ~76% and ~15.7% of cancer risk was caused by Cd and As levels, respectively. Decreasing soil pH enhanced the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks for the human body. Through exponential change between transfer factor (TF grain/soil ) and soil metals, HQ, a direct monitoring method for rice plants, was built using regression curves. It is proposed that besides condition of soil with high heavy metal concentration, for rice grown with surface soil metals, the safety of the rice product should be monitored when soil metals are under the following levels after harvest: non-carcinogenic risk, As &lt; 20 mg/kg, Pb &lt; 100 mg/kg, Cd &lt; 0.07–0.68 mg/kg and Cu 7.56–30.87 mg/kg; and cancer risk, As &lt; 20 mg/kg, Cd &lt; 4 mg/kg and Cr &lt; 200 mg/kg. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional chemotherapy suffers lack of bioavailability, selectivity and multidrug resistance (MDR). Nano-sized drug delivery systems (DDS) is developing aimed to solve several limitations of conventional drug delivery systems. These systems have been offered for targeting tumor tissue due to their long circulation time and improved drug solubility, retention (EPR) effect, and enhanced permeability. So, the aim of this research was the development and design of a novel targeted nanocarrier for cancer chemotherapy. For this reason, chitosan (CS) was first modified with a chain transfer agent (CTA) to create CS-CTA macroinitiator. Then, the controlled grafting polymerization of itaconic acid (IA) and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate quaternary ammonium alkyl halide (DMAEMAQ) monomers were occurred using reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to generate CS-g-(PIA-co-PDMAEMAQ) nanomicelles. To follow the cancer cells, fluorescein dye was entrapped into the core of nanomicelles and methotrexate (MTX) anticancer drug as a target ligand was incorporated into the cationic segment of nanomicelles. The chemical structures, biocompatibility, MTX loading capacity, in-vitro cytotoxicity effects and drug targeting ability of the developed nanomicelles were also investigated. Finally, it is expected that the nanomicelles can be used as a novel platform for targeted delivery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Betanin (BET) can reduce the side effects of potent anticancer drugs e.g. doxorubicin (DOX) on the normal tissues in co-administration with them because of the synergistic therapeutic effect and consequently the reduced required amount of anticancer agents. Despite interest in the use of BET, incomplete oral absorption and low stability of BET limit its application. Thus, in this study to overcome the restrictions of BET and providing the synergistic effect of DOX@BET, we designed a new pH-responsive nanocarrier via decoration of gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) by (methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly ((2-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate-co-itaconic acid) (PGNPs). DOX and BET were effectively loaded (the loading capacity of 20.5% and 16.25%, respectively) into the PGNPs and this nanoplatform exhibited the suitable small particle size (162 nm). Additionally, the triggered release ability of drugs was studied through the assessment of simulated physiological and tumor tissue environments and showed the controlled release of DOX and BET with adjusting the pH of environment. Moreover, the synergistic effect of DOX@BET loaded PGNPs decreased the cell viability amount of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) respect to the free form of DOX or BET which indicated that the developed smart nanocarrier will be a hopeful nanocarrier for cancer therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "MET amplification is a frequently observed genomic aberration in solid tumors. We conducted a phase I trial to evaluate dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination therapy. The following dose levels were tested in this single-arm phase I study: docetaxel as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour at 60 mg/m 2 once every 3 weeks of a 21-day schedule plus savolitinib (level 1, 200 mg qd; level 2, 400 mg qd; level 3, 600 mg qd; level 4800 mg qd). In total, there were 17 patients enrolled on to this study [7 gastric cancer (GC) patients, 5 melanoma patients, 3 sarcoma patients, and 2 rectal cancer patients]. Most of the patients (14 of 17) were heavily pretreated (≥third line or greater lines of treatment). For the first 3 cohorts (200 mg savolitinib + docetaxel 60 mg/m 2 , 400 mg savolitinib + docetaxel 60 mg/m 2 , 600 mg savolitinib + docetaxel 60 mg/m 2 ), there were no DLTs. In the fourth dose cohort (800 mg savolitinib + docetaxel 60 mg/m 2 ), one DLT occurred with generalized edema grade 3 that required intensive management. One GC patient with both MET overexpression (3+) and MET amplification (MET/CEP7 ratio, 7.3) achieved a durable partial response for 297 days, and another MET-amplified GC patient (MET/CEP7 ratio, 7.6) achieved stable disease for 86 days. Due to the higher incidence of G4 neutropenia in cohort 4 (800 mg), we recommend savolitinib 600 mg qd in combination with docetaxel 60 mg/m 2 as the RP2D for phase II trial. The combination therapy demonstrated a very promising antitumor activity with durable responses in MET amplified GC patients. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: There is unmet need to explore the predictive biomarkers of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we aimed to investigate the predictive and prognostic value of blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Methods: We performed a comprehensive online search to explore the association between blood NLR and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Published data including hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were eligible. Pooled estimates of treatment outcomes were calculated using Stata/MP 14.1. Results: 1700 patients from sixteen studies were included. The pooled results suggested that high blood NLR was correlated with significantly shorter OS (HR = 2.07, P < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 1.59, P < 0.001). The predictive and prognostic significance of blood NLR were observed consistently across most subgroups including publication year, study design, research region, PD-L1 expression detection, sample size, NLR cutoff, median follow-up time and study quality score. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between elevated NLR cutoff values and OS benefit (r = 0.585, P = 0.036) but not for PFS benefit (r = 0.198, P = 0.496). Notably, HRs of PFS showed significant correlation with HRs of OS (r = 0.686, P = 0.041). Conclusion: Elevated blood NLR was associated with shorter PFS and OS in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting its potential predictive and prognostic value in this clinical scenario. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To explore treatment-related changes in symptom burden and quality of life (QOL) in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) patients treated surgically and non-surgically. Patients and Methods: Eighty-six patients with human papillomavirus–associated OPSCC treated at the Head and Neck Center at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were recruited to a prospective registry study between 2014 and 2016 and completed the core, head and neck-specific, and symptom interference sections of the MD Anderson symptom inventory (MDASI) multi-symptom questionnaire and the EQ-5D health status assessment as a measure of QOL at four time points. Results: Longitudinal improvements from post-treatment nadir were observed across all groups. For patients treated with single modality, symptom interference, but not core and head and neck specific, MDASI scores were significantly better at 6 months in patients treated with surgery than radiation (P = 0.04). For patients treated with multiple modalities, scores for each of the three domains (i.e., core, head and neck -specific, and interference MDASI) were significantly better in the surgical group than the nonsurgical group at treatment completion (P = 0.0003, P = 0.0006 and P = 0.02) and 6 weeks (P = 0.001, P = 0.05 and P = 0.04), but not 6 months (P = 0.11, P = 0.16 and P = 0.040). No significant differences in EQ5D health status were observed between groups at any time point, reflecting similar overall QOL in all groups. Conclusion: Symptom burden and QOL improves after treatment in OPSCC survivors over time regardless of whether primary surgical or nonsurgical treatment is used, although acute symptom profiles may differ. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Recombinant human interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a potent cancer immunotherapeutic candidate due to its excellent immune stimulating effects. Previous work demonstrated that IL-15 appeared with short half-life in circulation system, while the complex with its receptor can prolong the half-life as well as benefit its activities in vivo. Therefore, IL-15 complex was more favorably considered for clinical development. Herein we developed IL-15·sIL-15Rα/Fc, a complex comprising of IL-15 and the extracellular region of its receptor alpha subunit which fused to Immunoglobulin G (IgG1) Fc to further prolong the half-life in plasma. Through transient gene expression in HEK293 cells, we expressed the superagonist by co-transfection of plasmids encoding IL-15 and sIL-15Rα/Fc respectively, yielding 36 mg/L of product after purification. Pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the combination profoundly prolonged the half-life of IL-15 to 13.1 h in mice, about 18 folds longer than that of IL-15 monomer which is around 0.7 h. The bioactivity of the superagonist was characterized by CTLL-2 cells proliferation assay in vitro, showing its capability of stimulating the expansion of memory CD8 + T cells (cluster of differentiation) in mouse spleen. Using a HT-29 xenograft NOD-SCID mouse model, we observed tumor growth inhibition in all groups that received the superagonist, indicating its anti-tumor efficacy via stimulating infused human immune cells. In addition, combo cancer treatment by IL-15·sIL-15Rα/Fc and programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody have shown stronger inhibitory effects as compared with treatment with either single molecule. Therefore, we developed IL-15·sIL-15Rα/Fc to be a long half-life potential cancer immunotherapy candidate that can be applied alone or in synergy with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "While previous studies have shown that the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) alone is not sufficient to reflect tumor progression and that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is correlated with colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis, COX-2 expression status and its potential functions in CTCs of CRC patients are unknown. Here, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype-based subsets of CTCs and the COX-2 expression status in CTCs were identified and their potential clinical values were assessed in 91 CRC patients. CTCs were enumerated in peripheral blood and subsets of CTCs (epithelial [eCTCs], mesenchymal [mCTCs], and biophenotypic [bCTCs]) and the COX-2 expression status were determined using the RNA in situ hybridization method. CTCs were detected in 80.2% (73 of 91) patients. Neither the total CTC nor eCTC numbers were found to significantly associate with any of the clinicopathological features. However, the number of mCTCs was significantly associated with distance metastasis (P = 0.035) and had a trend of being associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.055). Among the 73 patients enrolled for evaluating COX-2 expression, 52.5% (38 of 73) were found to express COX-2 in CTCs, and COX-2 expression in CTCs was not found to associate with the clinicopathological factors. However, COX-2 expression in mCTCs tended to have a higher rate in patients with metastasis compared with those without metastasis (72.0% vs 42.8%; P = 0.072). Furthermore, COX-2 expression and mCTC marker expression correlated positively (R = 0.287; P = 0.017). Further studies are required to investigate the clinical value of the expression of COX-2 in mCTCs, especially in CRC patients with the advanced tumor stage and distant metastasis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nor-wogonin, a polyhydroxy flavone, has been shown to possess antitumor activity. However, the mechanisms responsible for its antitumor activity are poorly studied. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms of nor-wogonin actions in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Methods: Effects of nor-wogonin on cell proliferation and viability of four TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, HCC70, and HCC1806) and two non-tumorigenic breast cell lines (MCF-10A and AG11132) were assessed by BrdU incorporation assays and trypan blue dye exclusion tests. Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were carried out by flow cytometry. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. Results: Nor-wogonin significantly inhibited the growth and decreased the viability of TNBC cells; however, it exhibited no or minimal effects in non-tumorigenic breast cells. Nor-wogonin (40 μM) was a more potent anti-proliferative and cytotoxic agent than wogonin (100 μM) and wogonoside (100 μM), which are structurally related to nor-wogonin. The antitumor effects of nor-wogonin can be attributed to cell cycle arrest via reduction of the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and CDK1. Furthermore, nor-wogonin induced mitochondrial apoptosis, (as evidenced by the increase in % of cells that are apoptotic), decreases in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), increases in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and caspase-3 cleavage. Moreover, nor-wogonin attenuated the expression of the nuclear factor kappa-B and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathways, which can be correlated with suppression of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 in TNBC cells. Conclusion: These results showed that nor-wogonin might be a potential multi-target agent for TNBC treatment. © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: To compare bDFS and toxicity outcomes in a population of intermediate risk prostate cancer patients treated using I-125 LDR brachytherapy with or without DIL boost based on multiple core biopsy maps. Materials and methods: Between January 2005 and December 2013, all our intermediate risk prostate cancer patients treated with LDR I-125 brachytherapy were reviewed. All patients were given 144 Gy to the prostate. A pathologic DIL distribution (defined by sextant biopsy) was contoured prospectively prior to planning, to be covered by the 150% isodose line. Of the 165 patients treated, 55 received a DIL boost. Patients completed prospectively the IPSS questionnaire, a sexual and bowel function questionnaire. Gastro-intestinal toxicities were graded according to CTCAE v4.03. A patient was considered to have erectile dysfunction if he was unable to achieve erection to perform intercourse. BDFS was determined according to the Phoenix consensus definitions. Results: The median follow-up was 78 months. The estimated 7-year bDFS rate was 96% (95% CI, 74–99%) in the DIL group versus 89% (95% CI, 79–94%) in the control group (p = 0.188). There was no difference between groups in urinary, gastro-intestinal or sexual toxicities up to 5 years of follow-up. There was no difference in urinary obstruction with catheterization between DIL versus control groups (3,6 vs 2,8 %, p = 1.00). Only 1 patient in the DIL group had ≥grade 3 toxicity (TURP) and none in the control group. Conclusions: Boost to DIL defined by sextant biopsy with permanent seed prostate implant shows a trend toward improvement of biochemical control in intermediate risk prostate cancer patient without increasing toxicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Porous and biodegradable hyaluronic acid (HA) nanogel and their copolymeric forms with sucrose (Suc), HA:Sucrose (HA:Suc) nanogels, were synthesized by employing glycerol diglycidyl ether (GDE) as crosslinker with a single step reaction in surfactant-free medium. The size of the nanogels was determined as 150 ± 50 nm in dried state from SEM images and found to increase to about 540 ± 47 nm in DI water measured with DLS measurements. The surface areas of HA and HA:Suc nanogels were measured as 18.07 ± 2.4 and 32.30 ± 6.1 m 2 /g with porosities of 3.58 ± 1.8, and 9.44 ± 3.1 nm via BET analysis, respectively. The zeta potentials for HA and HA:Suc nanogels were measured as −33 ± 1.4 and − 30 ± 1.2 mV, respectively. The thermal degradation of both types of nanogels revealed similar trends, while hydrolytic degradation of the nanogels was about 22.7 ± 0.2 wt% in 15 days. Both HA and HA:Suc nanogels were stable in blood up to 250 μg/mL concentration with approximately 0.5 ± 0.1% hemolysis ratio and 76 ± 12% blood clotting indices, respectively. Finally, these nanogels were used as a sustained slow-release or long-term delivery system over 2 days for a hydrophobic cancer drug, 3‑((E)‑3‑(4‑hydroxyphenyl)acryloyl)‑2H‑chromen‑2‑on (A # ) established by our group. The nanogels successfully delivered the model drug A at 10.43 ± 2.12 mg/g for 2 days. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Although Multidisciplinary Team Management (MDT) is integrated in most international head and neck cancer treatment guidelines, its applications and proceedings were rarely described. The present study explores a 6-year real-life experience in a French Comprehensive Cancer Care Center. Methods: Patients, tumor and meeting characteristics of all consecutive cases discussed in head and neck MDT meetings between 2010 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: From 2010 to 2015, 1849 cases (accounting for 1786 patients) were discussed in 138 MDT meetings. Median age was 62 (range: 15–96). When reported (n = 310, 16.8%), performance status was ≥2 in 36.1% of patients. Tumors were mainly squamous cell carcinomas (n = 1664, 91.5%) of the larynx/hypo-pharynx (n = 630, 34.4%), oropharynx (n = 518; 28.3%) and oral cavity (n = 339; 18.5%). Tumors were diagnosed at a locally (n = 358, 25%), locally advanced (n = 946, 66%) or metastatic setting (n = 53, 3.7%). Mean number of discussed patients per MDT meeting was 16 (range: 3–32). Most patients were discussed once (n = 1663, 97%). Most patients (n = 969, 52%) underwent treatment before MDT meetings: mainly surgery (n = 709, 73.2%). The mean time between MDT meeting and first radiation course was 21 days (range: 1–116). Discussion: Optimal multimodal treatment management is based on MDT meetings and results from the interaction and coordination of surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists. In the present series, most patients were discussed once despite the number of expected recurrences, suggesting that the management of tumor progression was not discussed in head and neck MDT meetings. Furthermore, most patients had surgery before MDT meeting, pointing out that MDT role and place still needs to be improved. Finally, the present population significantly differed from patients included in phase III clinical trials, with more advanced age and poorer condition. It calls for the necessity of a high-quality head and neck MDT meeting since evidence-based recommendations should be adapted to patient's frailties. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major cause of death for Vietnamese and Korean American women, yet their screening rates remain low. This study explored factors influencing cervical health behaviors of these populations, using a 2-dimensional model (ie, affect and cognition) of attitude structure approach. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 33 participants. A semantic content analysis was used to identify major codes and themes across the transcripts. Multiple aspects of both negative and positive affect and cognition, which led to 3 different cervical health behaviors (avoidance, ambivalence, and acceptance), emerged from the interviews. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Radiotherapy (RT) is a key therapeutic modality for prostate cancer (PrCa), but RT resistance necessitates dose-escalation, often causing bladder and rectal toxicity. Aspirin, a prodrug of salicylate (SAL), has been associated with improved RT response in clinical PrCa cases, but the potential mechanism mediating this effect is unknown. SAL activates the metabolic stress sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits de novo lipogenesis, and protein synthesis via inhibition of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), and the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), respectively. RT also activates AMPK through a mechanism distinctly different from SAL. Therefore, combining these two therapies may have synergistic effects on suppressing PrCa. Here, we examined the potential of SAL to enhance the response of human PrCa cells and tumors to RT. Methods: Androgen-insensitive (PC3) and -sensitive (LNCaP) PrCa cells were subjected to proliferation and clonogenic survival assays after treatment with clinically relevant doses of SAL and RT. Balb/c nude mice with PC3 xenografts were fed standard chow diet or chow diet supplemented with 2.5 g/kg salsalate (SAL pro-drug dimer) one week prior to a single dose of 0 or 10 Gy RT. Immunoblotting analysis of signaling events in the DNA repair and AMPK-mTOR pathways and lipogenesis were assessed in cells treated with SAL and RT. Results: SAL inhibited proliferation and clonogenic survival in PrCa cells and enhanced the inhibition mediated by RT. Salsalate, added to diet, enhanced the anti-tumor effects of RT in PC3 tumor xenografts. RT activated genotoxic stress markers and the activity of mTOR pathway and AMPK and mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC. Interestingly, SAL enhanced the effects of RT on AMPK and ACC but blocked markers of mTOR activation. Conclusions: Our results show that SAL can enhance RT responses in PrCa. Salsalate is a promising agent to investigate this concept in prospective clinical trials of PrCa in combination with RT. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: The 2014 British Thyroid Association thyroid cancer guidelines recommend lifelong follow-up of thyroid cancer patients. This is probably unnecessary, can cause patient anxiety, is time consuming and places significant demand on National Health Service resources. It has been suggested that low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients could be discharged to primary care once they are 5 years from diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential safety of this practice. Materials and methods: In total, 756 patients with dynamically risk-stratified (DRS) low-risk/excellent response to treatment DTC treated over 2001–2013 in the Leeds region were followed after diagnostic surgery and the recurrence rate calculated. Results: The median follow-up time was nearly 10 years (5–17 years). Radiological recurrence occurred in 13/756 (1.7%) patients and was always preceded by raised thyroglobulin/ thyroglobulin antibody levels. In all 13 patients elevation of thyroglobulin occurred within 5 years of diagnosis. Two additional patients were found to have rising thyroglobulin at almost 9 and 10.5 years from diagnosis, although to date radiological recurrence has not been detected. Assuming these two patients developed recurrence with longer duration of follow-up, then 0.26% (2/756) of patients would not have their recurrence discovered within 5 years of diagnosis. To detect 100% of patients with a putative recurrence in our cohort would require 10.5 years of follow-up. Four patients had transiently raised thyroglobulin, which became undetectable within 2 years (in three patients), without any treatment and radiological recurrence was not discovered. Conclusion: Discharge of DRS low-risk DTC patients to primary care after 5 years of secondary care follow-up is reasonable, accepting that late recurrence may occur in a very small minority of individuals (0.26%, ∼1:400). A more cautious approach would be to continue monitoring for 10 years, although the frequency of assessments could be reduced with increasing duration of follow-up. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cancer treatments are developing fast and the number of cancer survivors could arise to 20 million in United State by 2025. However, a large fraction of cancer survivors demonstrate cognitive dysfunction and associated decreased quality of life both shortly, and often long-term, after chemotherapy treatment. The etiologies of chemotherapy induced cognitive impairment (CICI) are complicated, made more so by the fact that many anti-cancer drugs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Multiple related factors and confounders lead to difficulties in determining the underlying mechanisms. Chemotherapy induced, oxidative stress-mediated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) elevation was considered as one of the main candidate mechanisms underlying CICI. Doxorubicin (Dox) is a prototypical reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating chemotherapeutic agent used to treat solid tumors and lymphomas as part of multi-drug chemotherapeutic regimens. We previously reported that peripheral Dox-administration leads to plasma protein damage and elevation of TNF-α in plasma and brain of mice. In the present study, we used TNF-α null (TNFKO) mice to investigate the role of TNF-α in Dox-induced, oxidative stress-mediated alterations in brain. We report that Dox-induced oxidative stress in brain is ameliorated and brain mitochondrial function assessed by the Seahorse-determined oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is preserved in brains of TNFKO mice. Further, we show that Dox-decreased the level of hippocampal choline-containing compounds and brain phospholipases activity are partially protected in TNFKO group in MRS study. Our results provide strong evidence that Dox-targeted mitochondrial damage and levels of brain choline-containing metabolites, as well as phospholipases changes decreased in the CNS are associated with oxidative stress mediated by TNF-α. These results are consistent with the notion that oxidative stress and elevated TNF-α in brain underlie the damage to mitochondria and other pathological changes that lead to CICI. The results are discussed with reference to our identifying a potential therapeutic target to protect against cognitive problems after chemotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Synthesis, characterization, DNA/BSA binding and cytotoxicity of organometallic binuclear Ru (II) complexes [(p-cym)(Fc-AA)Ru(μ-Im)Ru(Fc-AA)(p-cym)]Cl (C1–C4; where: p-cym = p-cymene MeC 6 H 4 Pr i , Fc-AA = N-ferrocenyl amino acid conjugates (Fc-tyr1, Fc-phe2, Fc-leu3, Fc-trp4) and Im = Imidazole) have been described. The complexes C1–C4 exhibited strong DNA/BSA binding affinity and cytotoxicity against human cervical cancer HeLa cell line. Their binding with calf thymus CT-DNA and bovine serum albumin BSA have been examined by absorption and emission spectral studies. Intercalative interactions between complexes and CT-DNA have been affirmed by EB displacement studies and DNA viscosity measurements, while interaction with BSA via static quenching was explored by fluorescence titration. The anti-cancer activity of C1–C4 was studied using MTT assay on HeLa cell line and the corresponding IC 50 values were calculated. The IC 50 value (30.0 μM–120.0 μM) obtained were further compared with the well-known ruthenium complex NAMI-A, currently under phase II clinical trials which has IC 50 value 608.5 μM. © 2019",

    "Funding Text 1": "N-ferrocenyl amino acids Organometallic binuclear ruthenium (II) complexes Imidazole DNA/BSA binding interactions Cytotoxicity HeLa cell Development and evaluation of effective anticancer agents exhibiting strong DNA and protein binding capabilities, high cytotoxicity and low side effects are highly in-demand in medicinal and pharmaceutical research. Organometallic compounds are an emerging category of therapeutics in anticancer research offering advantages where regular drugs are not efficient due to resistance. These compounds provide something alternative to inorganic therapeutics and organic drugs. Organometallic conjugation of biological molecules like amino acids, peptides, nucleobases or natural products is the most common and effective method for developing organometallic compounds which are medicinally promising candidates [ 1 ]. Our pursuit to design ferrocene based cytotoxic agent's stems from the fact that the ferrocenyl group can get reversibly oxidized to ferrocenium radical cation which can generate ROS under physiological conditions. This makes the ferrocenyl moiety redox active and cytotoxic with potential bioapplications. The first ruthenium anticancer compound to be studied on human beings was NAMI-A, a Ru(III) coordination compound of formula [ImH][ trans -RuCl 4 (dmso-S)(Im)] (dmso-S = sulfur-bonded dimethyl sulfoxide, Im = imidazole) [ 2 ]. In addition Ru(II)–polypyridyl compounds have shown excellent advantages as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy [ 3 ]. Furthermore organometallic ruthenium-arene complexes are being considered as alternative to platinum based drugs owing to their superior anticancer activity, lower side effects and photocytotoxicity [ 4 ]. Since interaction between metal complexes and DNA can cause DNA damage in cancer cells, study of the binding mechanism of metal complexes with DNA is of importance. Cytotoxicity of the organometallic ruthenium compounds have been attributed to their interaction with proteins, besides DNA [ 5 ]. Further, serum albumin is one of the most essential proteins involved in the transportation, distribution, accumulation and excretion of the drugs in tumour cells. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used as a model protein to evaluate binding behaviour and cytotoxicity of these compounds [ 6 ]. The organometallic binuclear ruthenium (II) arene complexes ( C1 – C4 ) with ferrocene amino acid conjugates as ligands have been synthesized and investigated for their interaction with CT-DNA and BSA. Results obtained from the binding studies prompted the in-vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of the complexes on human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line using MTT assay, and the corresponding IC 50 values were obtained and compared with other well-known anti-cancer agent. All the chemicals and solvents used for synthesis and characterization of ligands and complexes were of analytical grade and used as purchased. α-Terpinene was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, RuCl 3 . 3H 2 O and BSA from Hi-media and CT-DNA, Tri-sodium citrate and EB (ethidium bromide) were purchased from SRL (Sisco Research Laboratory, Mumbai, India). The solvents used in the present study were purchased from Merck and are of analytical grade. HeLa cell line was obtained from National centre for cell science (NCCS) Pune, India. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectral measurement was done using Applied Biosystem API 2000 Mass spectrometer. Infrared spectra in the range 4000–400 cm −1 were recorded on Perkin Elmer RX-1 FTIR using KBr pellets. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AR X 400 Spectrometer at 400 MHz using DMSO as solvent. UV spectra of all the complexes were recorded in CH 3 OH solution on Perkin Elmer Lambda-35 dual beam UV–vis spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra of the complexes were recorded using DMSO solution on JASCO FP-6300 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The ferrocenyl amino acids (Fc-AA) were synthesized according to the procedure reported [ . 7 ]. The binuclear metal complexes Cl– C4 were synthesized in two steps. Firstly, the mononuclear complexes [Ru(η 6 - p -cym)(Fc-AA)Cl]were synthesized by a typical μ-chlorido-bridge splitting reaction of [Ru(η 6 - p -cymene)Cl 2 ] 2 as described in the literature [ 8 ]. In the second step two equivalent moles of the mononuclear complex was dissolved in a mixture of 5 ml of CH 2 Cl 2 and 3 ml of CH 3 OH followed by addition of one equivalent mole of imidazole. The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min to form a homogeneous solution and a solution of 1.0 M NaOH was added to raise the pH upto ~11 and to deprotonate the –NH present in the imidazole ring [ 9 ]. The solution was kept stirring for 24 h at r.t. under N 2 atmosphere. The resultant reddish brown crystalline solid was then filtered, washed with pet ether and dried in oven at 40 °C for 1 h. The complexes so obtained were recrystallized from dichloromethane and ether. The general procedure for the synthesis of C1 – C4 is given in Fig. 1 CH); FTIR (KBr/cm C1 was synthesized by the reaction of the mononuclear complex [Ru(η 6 -p-cymene)(Fc-tyr)Cl] (0.092 mmol, 60.0 mg) and the bridging ligand imidazole (0.046 mmol, 3.1 mg).

The absorption spectral experiments to evaluate the interaction of the complexes with calf thymus DNA were conducted in Tris-HCl/NaCl buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM NaCl) having pH 7.2 and using stock solution of the complexes C1 – C4 (1 mM) in DMSO at an ambient temperature. The stock solution of CT-DNA was prepared in buffer and stored at 4 °C. Absorption studies were carried out by keeping fixed concentrations of complexes and varying the concentration of CT-DNA. Solution of the complexes was prepared by diluting with tris buffer to obtain the desired concentration. While measuring the absorption of the complexes, equal increments of CT-DNA solution were added to both the sample cell and to the reference cell in order to eliminate the absorbance of CT-DNA itself. The binding constant (K b ) of the complexes to DNA were calculated using the McGhee-von Hippel (MvH) method [ 10 ]. Fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to examine whether the complexes have the ability to displace EB from DNA–EB complex and to confirm the intercalative mode of binding of the complexes. The titration experiment was carried out by keeping the DNA-EB complex concentration constant and varying the complex concentration. The variation in the fluorescence emission spectrum of the DNA–EB complex was recorded by addition of aliquot of the complex. The fluorescence emission (λ ex  = 520 nm) was measured from 530 nm to 700 nm using 5 nm slits. Cannon–Ubbelohde viscometer was used to measure the relative viscosity of DNA. The viscosity measurements of DNA (200 μM) solutions were carried out at a constant temperature of 32.0 ± 0.1 °C in the presence of complexes C1 – C4 at [complex]/[DNA] ratio of 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16 and 0.20 in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.2). Digital stopwatch with least count of 0.01 s was used for flow time measurement with accuracy of ±0.1 s. The flow time of each sample was measured three times and an average flow time was calculated. Data are presented as (η/η 0 ) 1/3 versus [complex]/[DNA], where η is the viscosity of DNA in the presence of complex and η 0 is the viscosity of DNA alone. Viscosity values were calculated from the observed flow time of DNA-containing solutions (t) corrected for that of the buffer alone (t 0 ), η = (t − t 0 ) / t 0 [ 11 ]. The protein-binding study of C1 – C4 was performed employing steady state fluorescence spectroscopy. In the fluorescence quenching experiments, a 3.0 ml tris buffer solution of BSA (16.6 μM) was placed in a quartz cuvette and titrated with increasing concentrations of the complexes. The effect of increasing concentrations of the complexes on the emission of the tryptophan residues of BSA was monitored in the range 300–500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 296 nm [ 12 ]. Cytotoxicity of the synthesized complexes was assessed by standard MTT colorimetric assay [ 13 ]. HeLa cells (5.0 × 10 3 cells well −1 ) were placed in 96-well culture plates (Tarson India Pvt. Ltd.) and grown overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. C1 – C4 were added to the wells in the concentration range 0.5–150 mg/ml. Control wells were prepared by addition of culture medium without the compounds. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 48 h. Standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole)-2,5-diphenyltetraazolium bromide MTT dye solution was then added to each well. After 4 h of incubation, the culture media was thrown out and the wells were washed with Phosphate Buffer Saline (Hi-Media, India Pvt. Ltd.) which was followed by addition of DMSO to dissolve the formazan crystals formed and further incubation for 30 min. The optical density of each well was measured spectrophotometrically at 563 nm using Biotek-ELX800MS universal ELISA reader (Bio-Tek instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). The IC 50 values were determined by plotting the percentage viability versus concentration on a logarithmic graph and reading off the concentration at which 50% of cells remained viable relative to the control. Each experiment was repeated at least three times to obtain mean values. The ESI-Mass spectra of . The mass spectra have been provided in the Supplementary file (Fig. S1). C1 – C4 show m / z peaks corresponding to the molecular ion M + . The m / z values indicate that a p -cymene and an amino acid conjugated ferrocenyl ligand are coordinated to each of the metal centres with a deprotonated imidazole as a bridging ligand, thereby resulting in the formation of a binuclear complex. The molecular ion peaks have been provided in Table 1 The IR spectra of C1 – C4 (Fig. S2) displayed characteristic strong stretching bands at 1530–1660 cm −1 due to asymmetric and weaker bands at 1325–1373 cm −1 due to symmetric COO − stretch of the conjugated amino acids respectively which were found as strong bands in the fingerprint region at 1580–1610 cm −1 in the spectra of free ferrocenyl ligands [ 8 ]. A monodentate coordination mode of the carboxylate group of the ligands to the metal ion is indicated by the separation frequency (Δν) values which fall in the range 185–295 cm −1 [ 14 , 15 ]. The broad O-H stretching band of free carboxylic acid group found in the ligands at ~3546 cm −1 is completely lost in the IR spectra of the complexes indicating complexation via the carboxylate oxygen. Furthermore the N-H stretching bands at 2900–3000 cm −1 observed in the spectra of the ferrocenyl amino acids were found to blue shifted to 3050–3200 cm −1 in C1 – C4 indicating complexation of the ligands via the nitrogen of the secondary amine. The presence of weak to medium bands in the fingerprint regions owing to aromatic ν C-H stretch (2900–3000 cm −1 ) and strong bands due to the aromatic ν C=C in-plane vibrations (~1430–1667 cm −1 ) is indicative of presence of p-cymene in the complexes. The free ν N-H stretching of the imidazole around 3300–3364 cm −1 was absent in the spectra of C1 – C4 indicating deprotonation of the imidazole N-H on co-ordination to the two Ru(II) metal centres. The overall changes in the IR spectra suggest that the ferrocenyl-amino acid conjugates act as monoanionic bidentate ligands interacting with the metal centres via nitrogen of the secondary amine and carboxylate oxygen whereas disappearance of the imidazole N-H frequency suggested that two Ru(II) metal centres are bridged via an imidazole anion resulting in binuclear complex formation. The peaks arising due to carboxylic O-H and N-H of secondary amine in the free ferrocenyl ligands are no longer seen in the NMR spectra of the complexes indicating coordination of the carboxylate oxygen and nitrogen of secondary amine to the two ruthenium metal centres. Moreover the peaks owing to the aromatic protons in amino acid nucleus are observed in the region δ  = 7–9. The methyl and substituted methyl protons appear at around δ  = 1–2 ppm. The N-H proton of free imidazole observed at δ  = 11–13 as a sharp singlet was absent in the NMR spectra of the complexes suggesting co-ordination of the deprotonated imidazole N with one of the metal centre. The 1 H NMR spectra of C1 – C4 also show the following distinct peaks corresponding to p -cymene; 6 proton doublet at δ  = 1.19 ppm owing to two methyl protons of isopropyl group [CH(CH 3 ) 2 ], 3 proton singlet at δ  = 2.08 ppm due to the Ar-methyl para to the isopropyl group, 1 proton quartet at δ  = 2.85 ppm attributed to –CH of the isopropyl group and two 2 proton doublets at δ  = 5.8 ppm which can be assigned to the Ar-protons of p -cymene. The mass spectra have been provided in the Supplementary file (Fig. S3). The electronic absorption spectra of the complexes ) in the complexes due to coordination with Ru(II) metal centre. Absorption peaks in the region 275–277 nm corresponding to ). C1 – C4 were recorded in CH 3 OH solution in the region 200–450 nm. The electronic spectra of free ligands displayed intense absorption bands at 203–206 nm [ 8 ] ascribable to intra ligand π → π* transition of the cyclopentadienyl rings of ferrocene [ 16 ] which were observed in the longer wavelength region at 210–220 nm ( Fig. 2 n  → π* transitions of the ferrocenyl ligands were also observed ( Table 2 The electronic absorption spectra of complexes ). The intrinsic binding constants K ) gave a slope 1/( ) follow the order C1 – C4 consist of a well-resolved absorption band in the range of 210–220 nm assigned to intraligand π → π* transitions. Upon the addition of DNA, the band showed significant hypochromism accompanied with a red shift. These results indicate intercalative binding mode of the complexes to DNA and are similar to various metallo-intercalators reported earlier [ 17 ]. Intercalation of small molecules to DNA generally results in hypochromism and red shift (bathochromism) of the absorption band due to strong stacking interaction between the aromatic chromophore of the ligands and the base pair of the DNA [ 18 , 19 ]. The UV spectra of complexes C1 – C4 have been recorded in absence and presence of varying CT-DNA concentration (0–100 mM) within ( Fig. 3 b were obtained by monitoring the changes in the energy band at 210–220 nm with increasing concentration of DNA and using the equation: DNA / ε A − ε f = DNA / ε b − ε f + 1 / K b ε b − ε f where [DNA] is the concentration of DNA in base pairs, ε A  = A obsd  / [compound], ε f is the extinction coefficient for the unbound compound and ε b is the extinction coefficient for the compound in the fully bound form. A plot of [DNA]/( ε A - ε f ) vs [DNA] ( Fig. 4 ε b - ε f ) and an intercept (1/K b )( ε A - ε f ). The binding constant K b is the ratio of the slope to the intercept. The observed values of the binding constants K b ( Table 3 C2  >  C4  >  C1  >  C3 . Higher binding strength of C2 (9.3 × 10 3 ), C4 (8.6 × 10 3 ) and C1 (5.5 × 10 3 ) may be attributed to the presence of additional planar aromatic moieties in the amino acid conjugates which facilitates intercalation. The titration curves for complexes C2 – C4 have been provided as Supplementary material (Fig. S4). The changes observed in the fluorescence spectra of EB on its binding to CT DNA are often used for the interaction study between DNA and other compounds, such as metal complexes. The emission spectra of DNA-EB (λ ). The observed quenching of DNA-EB fluorescence suggests that they displace EB from the DNA-EB complex and interact with DNA probably by intercalation [ ) illustrate that the quenching of fluorescence of the DNA-EB complex is in good agreement (R = 0.93–0.99) with the linear Stern Volmer equation. The K ex  = 546 nm, λ em  = 610) complex in the absence and presence of increasing amounts of C1 – C4 have been recorded. Addition of complexes resulted in a significant decrease of the intensity of the emission band at 609 nm with slight red shift of the bands indicating the competition of the complexes with EB in binding to DNA ( Fig. 5 20 ]. The quenching constants (K SV ) determined from the slopes of the plots I 0 /I versus [Q]were used to evaluate the quenching efficiency of the complexes according to the Stern-Volmer equation [ 21 ]. The Stern-Volmer quenching plots ( Fig. 6 SV values obtained are shown in Table 3 . The titration curves for complexes C2 – C4 have been provided as Supplementary material (Fig. S5). In order to further confirm the modes of binding of complexes . With increasing [complex]/[DNA] concentration ratios, the relative viscosities of CT-DNA increased gradually indicative of characteristic intercalative mode of binding. C1 – C4 to CT-DNA, viscosity measurements of DNA solutions were carried out in presence and absence of the complexes. Intercalation elongates the double helix to accommodate the complex molecule in between the base pairs, leading to an increase in the viscosity of DNA. In contrast, DNA groove binding typically causes less pronounced (positive or negative) or no changes in DNA solution viscosity [ 22–24 ]. The effects of C1 – C4 and classical intercalator EB on the viscosities of CT-DNA solution are shown in Fig. 7 BSA solutions exhibit a strong fluorescence emission with a peak at 343 nm, due to the tryptophan residues, when excited at 296 nm [ ) suggesting that the complexes interact with BSA and causes quenching of fluorescence. The fluorescence quenching is quantified by the Stern-Volmer equation: I ) are given in . Binding of small molecules to a set of equivalent sites on the protein results into an equilibrium between the free and bound molecules represented by the double logarithm equation: log (Io-I)/I = log K ) and the values of K 25 , 26 ]. Addition of increasing concentrations of C1 – C4 to a solution of BSA (at a ratio of 0–7.5) results in a significant decrease of the protein fluorescence intensity ( Fig. 8 0 / I  = 1 + K SV [Q]. The K SV values obtained from the plot of [Q] versus I 0 /I ( Fig. 9 Table 4 b  +  n log [Q] [ 27 ]. The plot of log [(Io-I)/I] versus log [Q] for all the systems is linear ( Fig. 10 a (M −1 ) and n ( Table 4 ) have been obtained from the intercept and slope, respectively. The association binding constant K a values for C1 – C4 are 2.9 × 10 3 , 3.4 × 10 4 , 4.8 × 10 4 and 8.4 × 10 3  M −1 respectively. Values with a magnitude order in the range of 10 3 –10 6  M −1 for K a are indicative of an efficient interaction with the protein [ 28–30 ]. The number of binding sites n indicates the number of independent class of binding sites for the complexes on BSA and generally n  ≈ 1 [ 31 ]. The n values for the complexes average out to be 1 which suggests that there is one binding site available on the protein. Moreover the linear nature of the double logarithm plots ( Fig. 10 ) indicates that only one of the tryptophan residues on BSA protein is interacting with the compounds [ 32 ]. The titration curves for complexes C2 – C4 have been provided as Supplementary material in (Fig. S6). In-vitro cytotoxicity tests of the binuclear complexes were performed on the human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). The selection of this cell line is purely based on their higher occurrence in human population worldwide which is of prime concern. In-vitro cytotoxicity of the complexes . The antiproliferative activity of the complexes was found to be dose dependent, that is, the cell viability decreased with increasing concentrations. The IC . Although the synthesized ruthenium complexes are found to be less active compared to C1 – C4 in the HeLa cell line was evaluated using MTT assay. The cell viabilities (%), obtained for HeLa cells with exposure to the complexes for 48 h is depicted in Fig. 11 50 values of the complexes have been tabulated in Table 5 cis platin (IC 50  = 18.8 ± 3.4 μM), they are much more active compared to NAMI-A (ruthenium complex under phase II clinical trials) whose IC 50 values have been found to be in the range of 608.5 ± 55.4 μM for HeLa cell lines [ 33 , 34 ] and those of RAPTA-C > 1600 μM on treatment for 72 h [ 35 ]. In summary, homo-binuclear Ru(II) complexes of p -cymene and ferrocenyl amino acid ligands with imidazole as a bridging ligand were synthesized and characterized using various spectral techniques. DNA and BSA binding studies reveal that the binuclear complexes have good binding affinities towards the macromolecules compared to the mononuclear complexes [ 8 ] due to more available binding sites, larger cationic charge and a greater number of hydrophobic ligands than their mononuclear counterparts. Such impressive binding efficacies broaden their scope for in-vitro investigations as potent anticancer agents following which we carried out the cytotoxicity studies employing MTT assay. Lower IC 50 values of the complexes can be attributed to the presence of a hydrophobic arene moiety which facilitates cellular uptake of the complexes.

    "Abstract": "Repulsive guidance molecules comprise a group of proteins that play an important role in carcinogenesis through interactions with their receptors, but their function in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is unclear. Here, we investigated the potential role of the RGM family members in oral cancer pathogenesis. Our study showed that only RGMA was significantly downregulated in the OSCC tissues analyzed by TCGA and validated this finding in OSCC cells. The decreased expression of RGMA was strongly associated with the T stage and with poor prognosis. The ectopic expression of RGMA significantly inhibited the proliferation of OSCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we confirmed that RGMA was a target of miR-210-3p in OSCC and miR-210-3p overexpression contributed to the acceleration of OSCC growth. Further experiments revealed that HIF1A specifically interacted with the promoter of miR-210-3p and enhanced its expression. In summary, our research indicates that RGMA is regulated by the HIF1A/miR-210-3p axis and inhibits OSCC cell proliferation; thus, in the future, the development of therapies that target the HIF1A/miR-210-3p/RGMA axis may aid in the treatment of aggressive cancers. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "The lymphatic system is the immune system of the human body, and includes networks of vessels spread over the body, lymph nodes, and lymph fluid. The lymph nodes are considered as purification units that collect the lymph fluid from the lymph vessels. Since the lymph nodes collect the cancer cells that escape from a malignant tumor and try to spread to the rest of the body, the lymph node analysis is important for staging many types skin and breast cancers. In this paper, we propose a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) method that segments the lymph nodes and melanoma regions in a biopsy image and measure the proliferation index. The proposed method contains two stages. First, an automated technique is used to segment the lymph nodes in a biopsy image based on histogram and high frequency features. In the second stage, the proliferation index for the melanoma regions is calculated by comparing the number of active and passive nuclei. Experimental results on 76 different lymph node images show that the proposed segmentation technique can robustly segment the lymph nodes with more than 90% accuracy. The proposed proliferation index calculation has low complexity and has an average error rate of less than 1.5%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Due to the rising number of elderly patients and advances in endoscopic devices, early laryngeal and pharyngeal cancers are increasingly found in elderly patients. In these cases, minimally invasive endoscopic larygo-pharyngeal surgery (ELPS) may be indicated. However, the safety and efficacy of ELPS in elderly populations has not been established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety, outcomes and feasibility of ELPS in very elderly patients. Methods: Between February 2010 and April 2016, 29 pharyngeal cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions in 19 patients aged 75 years or older were treated with ELPS. Twenty-six resections were performed in total, and the patients’ clinical courses were reviewed. Results: Sixteen patients had multiple comorbidities and moderate to severe comorbidities were observed in 17 patients. The average surgical time and hospitalization period was 54.3 min and 18.8 days, respectively. On average, oral intake began 4.4 days after the procedure, and all patients eventually received nourishment by mouth; no percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy dependency was observed. Complications included post-operative bleeding and aspiration pneumonia in two cases each, and all complications were safely managed. The 3-year overall survival rate was 90.2% and the 3-year disease-specific survival rate was 100%. Conclusion: ELPS was safely performed in elderly patients, suggesting that it is a feasible treatment option for pharyngeal lesions in very elderly patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The great interest in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programme lies in its association with process of metastasis and invasion, which is a crucial cause of cancer-related death. Herein, we designed and reported three new NSAID-Pt(IV) prodrugs, taking Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) to disrupt EMT programme and assist genotoxic platinum-based drugs as a cytotoxicity booster, to offer a class of potential anticarcinogens with a multi-functional action mechanism. The NSAID-Pt(IV) prodrugs, especially Eto-Pt(IV), highly enhanced cellular uptake with amount up to 42-fold at 3 h compared with CDDP, and greatly increased DNA damage and cell apoptosis, showing much higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin in the tested cancer cells even in A549/cis cells. Among of them, Eto-Pt(IV) and Car-Pt(IV) exhibited more excellent activity than Sul-Pt(IV), arising from their reduction-labile and favorable lipophilicity. Most strikingly, Eto-Pt(IV) markedly inhibited metastasis and invasion of MCF-7 cells, owing to its COX-2 suppression that down-regulated active MMP-2, vimentin protein and up-regulated E-cadherin. In vivo, Eto-Pt(IV) displayed potent antitumor activity and no observable toxicity in BALB/c nude mice bearing MCF-7 tumors. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Colloidal nanoparticles suspensions (nanofluids) are the materials of consideration for thermal engineering due to their typically enhanced heat transportation characteristics in comparison to base liquid. Nanoliquids have utilizations in transportation, solar absorption, nuclear systems chilling, friction reduction and energy storage etc. Besides, magnetic nanoliquids are utilized in the cancer therapeutics via implementation of drug delivery and cancer imaging. Thus, in view of such utilizations, here modeling and simulations are presented to scrutinize the natural convective Fe3O4-water nanoliquid flow in an annulus between a triangle and a rhombus enclosures. Thermal radiation aspect is considered for formulation. CVFEM is implemented for computations of numerical outcomes. Impacts of embedding variables on the flow and heat transfer features have been perused. Furthermore a correlation for average Nusselt number is established in terms of energetic parameters. The obtained results portray that average Nusselt number rises subjected to Rayleigh number, radiation parameter and volume fraction of nanofluid while it diminishes when Hartmann number is increased. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "We report two cases of the comparison of diagnosis made with linked color imaging (LCI) and conventional white-light imaging (WLI) on the same patients. In case 1, a 75-year-old man in whom right upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed due to lung cancer had signs of bronchitis on postoperative day 8. The LCI demonstrated slight inflammatory changes that were not detectable with the conventional WLI on the tracheal wall. In case 2, in a 61-year-old woman who was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, the bronchial wall was checked to confirm the extent of the tumour. The submucosal vascularity and tumour margin on the bronchial mucosa were better visible on LCI than on WLI. We could easily detect the mucosal inflammatory lesion and the malignant lesion with LCI in comparison with conventional WLI. Both mucosal inflammatory and malignant lesions were better visible with LCI in comparison to WLI. © 2019 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Over the past few years, numerous developments and design principle of smart nanomaterials have pioneered different delivery modalities and routes for efficient drug administration. Nanocarriers comprising of fluorescent biomarkers and drug molecule at the same platform are promising vesicles for passive targeting and drug delivery. Here, we report the detailed pharmaceutical study of a novel synthesized multimodal nanoclinic consisting of Polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable polymer as drug matrix, Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) quantum dot as fluorescent marker and curcumin, a natural anti-cancer drug as drug molecule. This multimodal nanoclinic was synthesized by a modified miniemulsion technique and characterized by UV–Vis absorption and FTIR spectroscopy. The efficiency of this nano-vesicle was evaluated by in vitro experiments including drug release, cell cytotoxicity and uptake. Drug release profile was studied in PBS buffer and correlated with theoretical Higuchi modelling. MTT assay confirmed the bio-suitability of these nanocomposites. The fluorescence and confocal imaging show the successful uptake of this nanoclinic by human lung cancer cell line. These polymeric nanoparticles based system provide the promise for the design of next generation multimodal drug delivery modality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: There is still no clinically approved agent for mutant KRAS, which is the most common alteration in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Flavopiridol is a semisynthetic flavonoid that inhibits cell growth through cyclin-dependent kinases in G1/S or G2/M of the cell cycle and induces apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated its effect on cellular apoptosis, survival, and metastasis mechanisms on KRAS mutant A549, Calu-1, and H2009 cell lines. Methods: The cytotoxic effects of flavopiridol on NSCLC cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability test. The cells were treated with 200 and 400 nM flavopiridol, and, then, apoptosis, survival, and metastasis-related protein expressions were determined by Western blot analysis. The antimetastatic effects of flavopiridol were assessed by wound healing and Galectin-3 activity assay. Results: Flavopiridol drastically affected toxicity in all KRAS mutant NSCLC cells at nanomolar concentrations. Also, it could efficiently inhibit wound healing and Galectin-3 activity in all the cells tested. However, the metastasis-related protein expressions did not reflect these obvious effects on blotting. p-Erk was activated as a cellular survival mechanism to escape apoptosis in all the cells tested. Conclusion: Although there are many mechanisms that still need to be elucidated, flavopiridol can be used as a metastasis inhibitor and an apoptosis inducer in KRAS mutant NSCLC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, the development of the first integrated electrochemical immunosensor for the determination of the IL-13Rα2 is reported. The strategy involves the immobilization of a biotinylated capture antibody onto streptavidin-modified screen-printed electrodes through grafting with p-aminobezoic acid (p-ABA) and further activation using EDC/Sulfo-NHS chemistry. A hybrid nanomaterial composed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs) was used as nanocarrier of multiple detector antibody and HRP molecules. Amperometric detection with the system H 2 O 2 /hydroquinone (HQ) achieved a linear calibration plot ranging from 2.7 to 100 ng mL −1 IL-13sRα2, with a LOD value of 0.8 ng mL −1 . The immunosensor showed an excellent selectivity and was successfully applied to the determination of the target receptor directly in small amounts of raw cellular lysates and extracts of paraffin-embedded tissues from patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer at different stages. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Nanoscale supramolecular systems have been increasingly gaining importance as drug release vehicles due to their ability to target tumor cells. In this work, we have developed a new class of nanoassemblies derived from the phytosterol 24-EpiBrassinolide (EpiB) for the development of nanocarriers for the anticancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX). EpiB is a biocompatible cholesterol mimic, and has inherent apoptotic properties toward cancer cells. Thus, by encapsulating DOX within a nanocarrier with innate anticancer ability we have developed a targeting system that can enhance the uptake and efficacy of DOX in tumor cells. The nanocarriers were formed by self-assembly of EpiB. The morphologies of assemblies formed were dependent upon the concentration of EpiB used. While at low concentrations, spherical nanoassemblies were formed, at higher concentration, lamellar aggregates with birefringence properties were observed. Our results indicated that the drug loaded nanocarriers showed diffusion controlled release of the drug, and demonstrated antiproliferative effects, cellular uptake and were apoptotic against HeLa cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, EpiB loaded DOX enhanced both apoptosis and uptake into the cell's nuclei. These supramolecular assemblies may have potential applications for enhancing efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs through passive targeting. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Patients with haematological malignancies are more likely to die in hospital, and less likely to access palliative care than people with other cancers, though the reasons for this are not well understood. The purpose of our study was to explore haematology nurses' perspectives of their patients’ places of care and death. Method: Qualitative description, based on thematic content analysis. Eight haematology nurses working in secondary and tertiary hospital settings were purposively selected and interviewed. Transcriptions were coded and analysed for themes using a mainly inductive, cross-comparative approach. Results: Five inter-related factors were identified as contributing to the likelihood of patients’ receiving end of life care/dying in hospital: the complex nature of haematological diseases and their treatment; close clinician-patient bonds; delays to end of life discussions; lack of integration between haematology and palliative care services; and barriers to death at home. Conclusions: Hospital death is often determined by the characteristics of the cancer and type of treatment. Prognostication is complex across subtypes and hospital death perceived as unavoidable, and sometimes the preferred option. Earlier, frank conversations that focus on realistic outcomes, closer integration of palliative care and haematology services, better communication across the secondary/primary care interface, and an increase in out-of-hours nursing support could improve end of life care and facilitate death at home or in hospice, when preferred. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "NSD3s, the proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline (PWWP) domain-containing, short isoform of the human oncoprotein NSD3, displays high transforming properties. Overexpression of human NSD3s or the yeast protein Pdp3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces similar metabolic changes, including increased growth rate and sensitivity to oxidative stress, accompanied by decreased oxygen consumption. Here, we set out to elucidate the biochemical pathways leading to the observed metabolic phenotype by analyzing the alterations in yeast metabolome in response to NSD3s or Pdp3 overexpression using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. We observed an increase in aspartate and alanine, together with a decrease in arginine levels, on overexpression of NSD3s or Pdp3, suggesting an increase in the rate of glutaminolysis. In addition, certain metabolites, including glutamate, valine, and phosphocholine were either NSD3s or Pdp3 specific, indicating that additional metabolic pathways are adapted in a protein-dependent manner. The observation that certain metabolic pathways are differentially regulated by NSD3s and Pdp3 suggests that, despite the structural similarity between their PWWP domains, the two proteins act by unique mechanisms and may recruit different downstream signaling complexes. This study establishes for the first time a functional link between the human oncoprotein NSD3s and cancer metabolic reprogramming. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The Joint Advisory Group on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (JAG) was initially established in 1994 to standardise endoscopy training across specialties. Over the last two decades, the position of JAG has evolved to meet its current role of quality assuring all aspects of endoscopy in the UK to provide the highest quality, patient-centred care. Drivers such as changes to healthcare agenda, national audits, advances in research and technology and the advent of population-based cancer screening have underpinned this shift in priority. Over this period, JAG has spearheaded various quality assurance initiatives with support from national stakeholders. These have led to the achievement of notable milestones in endoscopy quality assurance, particularly in the three major areas of: (1) endoscopy training, (2) accreditation of endoscopy services (including the Global Rating Scale), and (3) accreditation of screening endoscopists. These developments have changed the landscape of UK practice, serving as a model to promote excellence in endoscopy. This review provides a summary of JAG initiatives and assesses the impact of JAG on training and endoscopy services within the UK and beyond. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.",

    "Abstract": "A 59-year-old man with relapsed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion-positive stage IA adenosquamous carcinoma after lobectomy was treated with erlotinib and bevacizumab for 1 year followed by erlotinib alone for 1 year. Because of mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and a nodule on the left anterior chest wall, the patient underwent repeat biopsy from the supraclavicular lymph node. Pathological analysis demonstrated adenosquamous carcinoma harbouring EGFR exon 19 deletion and T790M mutation. Osimertinib treatment was therefore started. Six months later, the patient underwent a second-repeat biopsy from the mediastinal lymph nodes and liver metastases. Both specimens showed small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). After chemotherapies for SCLC, he died from lung cancer. An autopsy demonstrated tumour heterogeneity, including histological types of adenosquamous, SCLC, and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Repeat biopsies at the time of disease progression are useful to choose subsequent treatment for patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer. © 2019 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Recent in vitro and small-animal studies have demonstrated that anti-cancer efficiency of the emerging nanomedical technology of local magnetic hyperthermia can be essentially enhanced by concurrent chemotherapy. So far, this encouraging result has been obtained in magnetic field conditions inapplicable to human body. In this article we report on magnetic hyperthermia system that proved capability of effective treatment of tumors in small-animals by the means of chemotherapy enhanced thermal ablation with the use of magnetic fields applicable to any part of human body. It is based on the rejection of traditional superparamagnetic nanoparticles in favor of hard magnetic particles, optimized taking into account the identified physiological and physical limitations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Our study aimed to assess the prevalent, incident, and persistent infection, and clearance of HPV among 19 753 individual women attending the gynecological department at a major comprehensive hospital. HPV 16, 52, and 58 ranked top three types with the highest prevalence and incidence. The prevalence of high-risk (HR) HPV peaked among women aged 15 to 19 years, then sharply decreased with age, stabilized among women aged 25 to 44 years, and then surged again among women aged 45 years and older. HR HPV infection were more likely to be prevalent (15.9% vs 1.3%, P < 0.001), incident (17.3 vs 2.0 per 1000 person-months, P < 0.001), and persistent (33.0% vs 24.2%, P = 0.033), and less likely to clear (88 vs 115 per 1000 person-months, P = 0.040) compared to low-risk HPV types. The majority of women detected with HR HPV types did not retest within 12 months. Clinical guidelines on HPV DNA testing are needed and education and counseling about HPV infection and its implications for women detected with HPV at clinical settings are warranted. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A new prenylated flavonostilbene, namely, alopecurone P together with three known compounds sophoraflavanone G, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]furan-3,4,6-triol and alopecurone J were characterized from the roots of Sophora pachycarpa. The absolute configuration of alopecurones J and P were characterized by comparison of experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy and simulated data using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for possible stereoisomers. The cytotoxic properties of isolated compounds have also been evaluated on two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal cell line (NIH/3T3) using AlamarBlue®, flowcytometry and western blot assays. Alopecurone J and P showed cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cell line through Wnt signaling pathway. It seems that the presence of lavandulyl substitution in C-8 position of flavanone structure increased the cytotoxic effect. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A series of novel B[sbnd] and C-rings truncated deguelin derivatives have been designed and synthesized in the present study as heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors. The synthesized compounds exhibited micromolar antiproliferative potency toward a panel of human cancer cell lines. Their structure-activity relationships (SARs) were investigated in a systematic manner. Compound 21c was identified to have high Hsp90 binding potency (60 nM) and caused degradation of client proteins through ubiquitin proteasome system. Further biological studies showed that compound 21c induced a dose-dependent S and G2-phase cell cycle arrest on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot analyses confirmed that compound 21c caused apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. In addition, compound 21c showed much potent inhibition on the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that 21c might be a promising lead compound for further development of Hsp90 inhibitors. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "To develop a carrier for targeted drug delivery and triggered drug release in a reducing-tumor environment, reduction-sensitive hyaluronic acid-g-stearic acid (HCS) micelles were synthesized using a coupling agent. The HCS 40% was shown to have a more compact particle size than HCS 20% and the particle size of doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded HCS (HCSD) was increased relative to that of HCS micelles. The behavior of DOX release from HCSD showed that DOX was rapidly released in GSH (10 mM) solution. The site-specific targeting effect of HCSD nanoparticles was investigated by cellular uptake and competition assay at HCT116 and CT26 cell lines. An in vivo study of HCSD revealed that tumor suppression and site-specific targeted delivery of HCSD nanoparticles in HCT116-xenografted tumors were more superb than in the CT26-xenografted tumor. These results suggest that HCSD nanoparticles can be expected to have high therapeutic efficacy because they enable targeted drug delivery and rapid drug release. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) is a new, evolving form of radiotherapy that has potential for clinical application. Several studies have shown in preclinical models that synchrotron MRT achieves equivalent tumor control to conventional radiotherapy (CRT) but with significantly reduced normal tissue damage. Methods: To explore differences between these two modalities, we assessed the immune cell infiltrate into EMT6.5 mammary tumors after CRT and MRT. Results: CRT induced marked increases in tumor-associated macrophages and neutrophils while there were no increases in these populations following MRT. In contrast, there were higher numbers of T cells in the MRT treated tumors. There were also increased levels of CCL2 by immunohistochemistry in tumors subjected to CRT, but not to MRT. Conversely, we found that MRT induced higher levels of pro-inflammatory genes in tumors than CRT. Conclusion: Our data are the first to demonstrate substantial differences in macrophage, neutrophil and T cell numbers in tumors following MRT versus CRT, providing support for the concept that MRT evokes a different immunomodulatory response in tumors compared to CRT. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Theaflavin (TF) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) both have been reported previously as microtubule depolymerizing agents that also have anticancer effects on various cancer cell lines and in animal models. Here, we have applied TF and EGCG in combination on HeLa cells to investigate if they can potentiate each other to improve their anticancer effect in lower doses and the underlying mechanism. We found that TF and EGCG acted synergistically, in lower doses, to inhibit the growth of HeLa cells. We found the combination of 50 µg/mL TF and 20 µg/mL EGCG to be the most effective combination with a combination index of 0.28. The same combination caused larger accumulation of cells in the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle, potent mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and synergistic augmentation of apoptosis. We have shown that synergistic activity might be due to stronger microtubule depolymerization by simultaneous binding of TF and EGCG at different sites on tubulin: TF binds at vinblastine binding site on tubulin, and EGCG binds near colchicines binding site on tubulin. A detailed mechanistic analysis revealed that stronger microtubule depolymerization caused effective downregulation of PI3K/Akt signaling and potently induced mitochondrial apoptotic signals, which ultimately resulted in the apoptotic death of HeLa cells in a synergistic manner. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The classification is a one of the most indispensable domains in the data mining and machine learning. The classification process has a good reputation in the area of diseases diagnosis by computer systems where the progress in smart technologies of computer can be invested in diagnosing various diseases based on data of real patients documented in databases. The paper introduced a methodology for diagnosing a set of diseases including two types of cancer (breast cancer and lung), two datasets for diabetes and heart attack. Back Propagation Neural Network plays the role of classifier. The performance of neural net is enhanced by using the genetic algorithm which provides the classifier with the optimal features to raise the classification rate to the highest possible. The system showed high efficiency in dealing with databases differs from each other in size, number of features and nature of the data and this is what the results illustrated, where the ratio of the classification reached to 100% in most datasets).

    "Abstract": "Cancer is the major burden of disease worldwide. The folate receptor, as a specific tumor target, is over-expressed in many types of cancer including ovarian carcinomas, breast, colon, renal, and lung tumors. Nuclear medicine hybrid imaging modalities, such as SPECT/CT, provide both metabolic and anatomic information. Therefore, specific contrast agents are essentially needed. Liposomes are favorable systems with many advantages. The aim of this study was to formulate liposomal imaging agents for molecular tumor imaging by SPECT or SPECT/CT and evaluate their efficacy. Nanosized, polyethyleneglycolated, folate-conjugated and unmodified, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine containing, neutral and positively charged liposomes were formulated and characterized by mean particle size, zeta potential, and quantitative determination of the phospholipids in the liposomes. The binding of the synthetized imaging agents to 4T1 breast tumor cells was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and radioactivity counting. Folate-conjugated neutral and positively charged liposomes were found to be effective as tumor imaging agents exhibiting an almost 3-fold increased uptake and brighter fluorescence microscopy images than unmodified ones in in vitro experiments using 4T1 breast tumor cells. These results could be considered as an important step towards the development of folate-specific agents for tumor imaging by SPECT and SPECT/CT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Marine bio-resources are being widely studied as an invaluable source of compounds with therapeutic applicability. In particular, macroalgae contain an extended variety of bioactive compounds with different structures and promising biological applications. In this work, Ulva lactuca L. (hereafter UL) was utilyzed for the synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles. Full characterization by UV–Vis spectroscopy, TEM, HRTEM and STEM miscroscopies, Z Potential and FTIR spectroscopy was performed. The first time in the scientific literature, the composition of carbohydrates of UL extract and their changes observed after nanoparticles synthesis were explored in order to investigate their possible role in the biosynthetic process. The reducing power, total phenolic content and DPPH scavenging activity of UL extract, Au@UL and Ag@UL nanoparticles were determined. The effects of UL extract, Au@UL and Ag@UL were tested in vitro on the colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and Caco-2, on normal primary neonatal dermal fibroblast cell line PCS-201-010, as well as on normal colon cell line CCD-112CoN. Lastly, the apoptotic activity and cellular uptake evaluation was determined for Au@UL and Ag@UL. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Despite tremendous progress made in the understanding of the ERα signaling pathway and the approval of many therapeutic agents, ER+ breast cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer death in women. We set out to discover compounds with a dual mechanism of action in which they not only compete with estradiol for binding with ERα but also can induce the degradation of the ERα protein itself. We were attracted to the constrained chromenes containing a tetracyclic benzopyranobenzoxepine scaffold, which were reported as potent selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Incorporation of a fluoromethyl azetidine side chain yielded highly potent and efficacious selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), such as 16aa and surprisingly, also its enantiomeric pair 16ab. Co-crystal structures of the enantiomeric pair 16aa and 16ab in complex with ERα revealed default (mimics the A-D rings of endogenous ligand estradiol) and core-flipped binding modes, rationalizing the equivalent potency observed for these enantiomers in the ERα degradation and MCF-7 anti-proliferation assays. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "More and more evidence indicate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to indirectly regulate messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, which represents a novel layer of gene regulation that plays a critical role in the development of cancers. However, functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs network in osteosarcoma are still largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively compared the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs between osteosarcoma and normal samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to elaborate related latent mechanisms. Two lncRNAs, ie, LINC01560 and MEG3, were identified to be aberrantly expressed. Importantly, MEG3 was considered as a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with osteosarcoma according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis of another independent osteosarcoma data set from the Cancer Genome Atlas (P = 0.05). Eventually, we successfully established a dysregulated lncRNA-related ceRNA network, including one osteosarcoma-specific lncRNA, three miRNAs and four mRNAs. In conclusion, this study should be beneficial for improving our understanding of the lncRNA-mediated ceRNA regulatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma and providing it with novel candidate diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Previous studies showed that some patients after the treatment of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies experienced immune-related diarrhea. In this study, we aim to explore the association between intestinal microbiota and immune-related diarrhea. Methods: We obtained the fecal samples of 26 advanced lung cancer patients before the first dose of anti-PD-1 antibodies. Results: Eight of 26 patients experienced diarrhea after the treatment of anti-PD-1 antibodies. At the phylum level, our study demonstrated that Bacteroidetes were higher in diarrhea-free (D-F) patients, while Firmicutes were lower. Bacteroides and Parabacteroides belonging to Bacteroidetes phylum and Phascolarctobacterium of Firmicutes phylum were more abundant in D-F patients. Whereas, Veillonella of Proteobacteria phylum was lower in D-F patients. Conclusion: Our study highlights that intestinal microbiota variation is correlated with the subsequent development of immune-related diarrhea. © 2019 Yi Hu.",

    "Abstract": "The study elucidates the effect of ɑ-linolenic acid (ALA) on mitochondrial stress, hypoxic cancer microenvironment, and intervention of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) induced estrogen receptor (ER+) mammary gland carcinoma and Caenorhabditis elegans model, respectively. The efficacy of ALA was scrutinized in vivo and in vitro using various experiments like hemodynamic studies, morphological analysis, antioxidants parameters, immunoblotting, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The effect of ALA was also validated using C. elegans worms. ALA administration had a positive effect on tissue architecture of the malignancy when scrutinized through the whole mount carmine staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and scanning electron microscopy. The proteomic and genomic checkpoint revealed the participation of mitochondrial dysfunction, alteration of hypoxic microenvironment, and involvement of cholinergic anti-inflammatory response after treatment with ALA. ALA treatment has also increased the level of synaptic acetylcholine and acetylcholine esterase with a significant decrease in lipid content. It was concluded that ALA persuaded the mitochondrial stress, activation of downstream cholinergic anti-inflammatory markers, and favorable regulation of hypoxia microenvironment through inhibition of fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Synthesis of folic-acid mediated targeting nanocarrier is one of the most important and effective approaches in drug delivery. In this study, firstly, the surface of polyamidoamine G4 (PAMAM G4) dendrimers was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to reduce dendrimer toxicity and was engineered with folic acid (FA) to increase nanocomplex targeting of the mice myoblast C2C12 cell lines. Both these synthetic phases were characterized via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry (UV–Vis), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Secondly, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), as a chemotherapeutic agent, was loaded in the nanocarrier to therapeutic goals and was characterized. In vitro drug release was also assessed and an excellent controlled release with good release efficiency was reported. The size, diameter, surface morphology, and surface charge of these synthesized nanocomplexes were ascertained with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analyser, respectively, and PAMAM G4 positive charges eliminated. Finally, our nanocomplex was tested on the HT-29 human colorectal cancer and mice myoblast C2C12 normal cell lines and cell viability was evaluated with an 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Good cancer cell inhibition and cell growth promotion effects of the nanocomplexes have been indicated in this research study. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) entails using a narrow gauge (25-22 G) needle to collect a sample of a lesion for microscopic examination. It allows a minimally invasive, rapid diagnosis of tissue but does not preserve its histological architecture. FNAC is commonly used for diagnosis of breast cancer, with traditional practice being based on the subjective visual assessment of the breast cytopathology cell samples under a microscope to evaluate the state of various cytological features. Therefore, there are many challenges in maintaining consistency and reproducibility of findings. However, the advent of digital imaging and computational aid in diagnosis can improve the diagnostic accuracy and reduce the effective workload of pathologists. This paper presents a comparison of various deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based fine-tuned transfer learned classification approach for the diagnosis of the cell samples. The proposed approach has been tested using VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50 and GoogLeNet-V3 (aka Inception V3) architectures of CNN on an image dataset of 212 images (99 benign and 113 malignant), later augmented and cleansed to 2120 images (990 benign and 1130 malignant), where the network was trained using images of 80% cell samples and tested on the rest. This paper presents a comparative assessment of the models giving a new dimension to FNAC study where GoogLeNet-V3 (fine-tuned) achieved an accuracy of 96.25% which is highly satisfactory. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Theileria annulata is a protozoan parasite that infects and transforms bovine macrophages causing a myeloid-leukaemia-like disease called tropical theileriosis. TGF-β2 is highly expressed in many cancer cells and is significantly increased in Theileria-transformed macrophages, as are levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), notably H 2 O 2 . Here, we describe the interplay between TGF-β2 and ROS in cellular transformation. We show that TGF-β2 drives expression of catalase to reduce the amount of H 2 O 2 produced by T. annulata-transformed bovine macrophages, as well as by human lung (A549) and colon cancer (HT-29) cell lines. Theileria-transformed macrophages attenuated for dissemination express less catalase and produce more H 2 O 2 , but regain both virulent migratory and matrigel traversal phenotypes when stimulated either with TGF-β2, or catalase to reduce H 2 O 2 output. Increased H 2 O 2 output therefore, underpins the aggressive dissemination phenotype of diverse tumour cell types, but in contrast, too much H 2 O 2 can dampen dissemination. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs), as dynamic organelles, are associated with physiologically and pathologically metabolic processes. Especially, in human liver cancer cells (HepG2 cells) the lipid metabolism shows significant difference by comparing with the human normal liver cell (L02 cells). In this work, a new highly selective and specific fluorescent probe TPA-SD for the detection of LDs has been rationally designed and easily prepared from triphenylamine and salicylaldehyde, which possesses aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and excited state intramolecular proton transfer characteristics (ESIPT). Ideal probes for LDs imaging require high concentration accumulation of fluorophores in LDs and lack of self-quenching in the aggregated state, so the AIE property is necessary. TPA-SD can successfully and specifically accumulate in LDs, thus facilitating clearly distinguishing L02 cells from HepG2 cells according to obvious difference in the number of dot-shaped LDs marked by TPA-SD. The dot-shaped LDs in the HepG2 cells is found to be obviously more than that in the L02 cells. Moreover, the spatial distribution of LDs could be identified by TPA-SD. The results indicate TPA-SD possesses great potential in imaging and diagnosis of LDs-related diseases. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "A 12-year-old female cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) was presented with a squamous cell carcinoma involving the uropygial gland. Electrochemotherapy (ECT) as a minimally invasive treatment option was applied. The patient was anesthetized, a chemotherapeutic agent was injected intratumorally, and electrical pulses were delivered using plate and needle electrodes. In the first session of ECT cisplatin was used, and no change in tumor volume was observed during the following month. In a further 2 treatments 1 month apart, bleomycin was used. The tumor responded, and the mass became necrotic and eventually disappeared. Unfortunately, the tumorous mass reappeared after 3 months. Therefore, a fourth ECT using bleomycin was performed and the tumor completely regressed. No tumor growth was seen in 18 months after the last therapy. This report presents the clinical significance of ECT using cisplatin and bleomycin in treatment of uropygial gland squamous cell carcinoma in a cockatiel. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Research has shown that a child's knowledge about what is happening to a parent when he/she has a cancer disease is crucial to the child's health and wellbeing. Therefore the purpose of this study was to explore parents’ perceptions of how nurses in clinical practice care for children as relatives when one parent in the family has a cancer disease. Method: A qualitative explorative design with interviews was used. Altogether 28 parents (17 patients and 11 partners) were interviewed. The transcripts from the interviews were subjected to qualitative content analysis. Results: The parents perceive that the nurses make efforts to support the child as well as them as parents, but feel that the care needs to be more tailored to the specific child and his/her situation. The children are initially invited, generally informed and seen by the nurses, but the parents perceive that they themselves need repeated support and advice over time to uphold their parental responsibility for caring for their children during the illness trajectory. Conclusion: The parents argue for the importance of receiving repeated advice and support for how to talk to their children about the disease and treatment. The parents describe how the nurses were helpful by asking after the children and explaining the value of their visiting the hospital. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Nifedipine, a known substrate to breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2/BCRP), is used for the treatment of hypertension during breastfeeding. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ABCG2 c.421C>A on nifedipine transfer to breast milk (BM) in hypertensive women. Nineteen hypertensive breastfeeding women treated with 20 mg nifedipine every 12 hours were investigated. Blood and BM samples were collected simultaneously 15–30 days after delivery and at least 15 days after drug treatment. Patients genotyped as ABCG2 c.421CC showed nifedipine plasma and BM concentrations ranging from 8.32–178.1 ng/mL and 4.8–58.5 ng/mL, respectively. ABCG2 c.421C>A showed a trend towards significance (p = 0.0793) on nifedipine in BM, with concentrations approximately 3 times higher in the heterozygous 421 CA (29 ng/mL) in comparison to 421 CC (10.5 ng/mL). Nifedipine BM/plasma ratio was significantly lower in 421CC when compared to 421CA (p = 0.01). In conclusion, ABCG2 c.421C>A polymorphism is associated with higher transfer of nifedipine to BM. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Increasing studies showed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) had crucial regulatory roles in various tumors, including gastric cancer (GC). Recent studies demonstrated that lncRNA nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase-antisense RNA1 (NNT-AS1) played an important role in several tumors. However, the role and expression of NNT-AS1 in GC progression remain unknown. In our study, we indicated that NNT-AS1 expression was upregulated in GC samples compared with the nontumor tissues. We also showed that NNT-AS1 expression was upregulated in the GC cell lines. Ectopic expression of NNT-AS1 promoted GC cell line HGC-27 cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and invasion. In addition, we showed that NNT-AS1 acted as a sponge competing endogenous RNA for microRNA-363 (miR-363), which was downregulated in the GC samples and cell lines. miR-363 expression was negatively related with NNT-AS1 expression in GC samples. Upregulated expression of miR-363 suppressed GC cell growth, cycle, and invasion. Furthermore, we reported that elevated expression of NNT-AS1 promoted GC cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion partly by suppressing miR-363 expression. These results indicated that lncRNA NNT-AS1 acted as an oncogene in the development of GC partly by inhibiting miR-363 expression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequent malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 3 interacting protein (PSMC3IP) is an oncogene in breast cancer, while its role in HCC remains unclear. Here, we found that PSMC3IP was critical for the cell proliferation and tumorigenic capacity of HCC cells. Upregulation of PSMC3IP was observed in HCC specimens, and high PSMC3IP expression predicted poor overall survival of HCC patients. In vitro, knockdown of PSMC3IP blunted the proliferation and colony formation of BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. Likewise, PSMC3IP silencing suppressed the xenografted tumor development of BEL-7404 cells. Mechanistically, apoptosis was enhanced after PSMC3IP knockdown in both BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. At the molecular level, TP53 and GNG4 were upregulated and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E) and insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) were downregulated in shPSMC3IP compared with shCtrl BEL-7404 cells. Therefore, targeting PSMC3IP maybe a promising strategy for HCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The organoantimony(V) derivative of salicylic acid (SalH 2 ), {[Ph 3 Sb(SalH)] 2 O} (SalOSbi) was synthesized and tested for its anti-proliferative activity. SalOSbi was characterized by melting point and FT-IR, 1 H NMR, Uv–Vis spectroscopic techniques. Its crystal and molecular structure is also determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography. The antiproliferative activity of SalOSbi against human breast cancer cells: MCF-7 (Hormone Dependent (HD)) and MDA-MB-231 (Hormon Independent (HI) is congener or better than that of cisplatin. However SalOSbi is less toxic (by 7-fold) against human lung embryonic fibroblast cells (MRC-5), than cisplatin. Micronucleus assay shows that SalOSbi demonstrates similar in vitro genotoxicity with cisplatin against MRC-5 cells. The apoptotic type of cells death, caused by SalOSbi, was studied by cell cycle arrest and permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane test. Electronic spectroscopic data confirm strong covalent binding of SalOSbi with DNA, through N (purine or pyrimidine) -M bonds in a similar manner to cisplatin. No inhibitory interaction with lipoxygenase (LOX) has been detected suggesting the non-involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
