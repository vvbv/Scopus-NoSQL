    "Abstract": "The controversy that iodine intake may increase the risk of thyroid cancer has heightened over the past twenty years. In this retrospective study, we mainly analyzed the association between water iodine and thyroid cancer and discussed the possible cause of the increase in thyroid cancer. This study was supported by three hospitals in areas with different water iodine concentration. 5574 patients with thyroid disease were recruited, of which 1429 patients had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. These samples collectively were used to analyze the relationship of incidence and prevalence associated with water iodine. In addition, the ratio of maximum tumor diameter was analyzed. By analyzing the proportion of patients with thyroid cancer in thyroid diseases, we found a decrease in the proportion of thyroid cancer with increasing water iodine (P < 0.0001). In addition, there was no significant correlation between the median water iodine and the prevalence of thyroid cancer, including papillary thyroid cancer (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, the 5 years' cumulative incidence of thyroid cancer increased with years (P < 0.01). Comparing Cao county and Shan county, which are areas with high water iodine, to adequate iodine area such as in Mudan district, an increasing incidence is observed in 2010–2014 in Mudan district. Again, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of thyroid cancer with tumor size < 1 cm (P < 0.01). Therefore, we concluded that cause(s) of increase in thyroid cancer may be ascribed to the sensitive diagnostic techniques and the improvement of living condition, but not water iodine. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "After years of standard care prescribed to cancer patients without any selection except the primary site and histology of the tumour, the era of precision medicine has revolutionised cancer care. Personalised medicine refers to the selection of patients for specific treatment based on the presence of specific biomarkers which indicate sensitivity to corresponding targeted therapies and/or lower toxicity risk, such that patients will have the greatest chance of deriving benefit from the treatments. Here, we review personalised medicine for nonsmall cell lung cancer. © ERS 2017.",

    "Abstract": "The present study predicts a spatial distribution of lung cancer morbidity in Chinese males due to exposure to PM2.5 concentration from 2010 to 2015. A spatial autocorrelation method was used to evaluate the spatial relationship between the lung cancer morbidities from 2006 to 2009 and satellite-derived PM2.5 atmospheric levels. A comprehensive grey correlation degree analysis was carried out to assess the simultaneous and lag associations between the lung cancer morbidity and PM2.5 concentration. These relationships were subsequently applied to predict male lung cancer morbidity in a specific year. Annual mean PM2.5 levels in this specific year and previous 8 years were used as 9 independent variables to establish four statistical models. These models include ridge regression (RR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), and the combined forecasting model (CFM) to predict the male lung cancer morbidity in China from 2010 to 2015. The model error evaluations suggested that the partial least squares regression model performed the best in the male lung cancer morbidity forecast. We calculated the male lung cancer morbidity by the optimal method among the established statistical forecasting models at 1948 sites in China. The gridded morbidity distribution from 2010 to 2015 across the country was obtained by Kriging interpolation method. Results showed that the male lung cancer morbidity increased significantly from western to eastern China, except for the far north region. This spatial pattern is in line with the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration, manifesting a significant relationship between PM2.5 concentration level and lung cancer morbidity in Chinese males. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "This study was aimed to investigate the molecular detection of the CYP1A1 gene polymorphism and its role in breast cancer enhancement. Additionally, understanding some of the environmental factors and their relationship to the occurrence of breast cancer was proposed for this study. Blood samples were collected from 50 women at ages between 21-71 years old, that suffered from breast cancer and 50 healthy women who are considered as a control group. The samples were placed in EDTA-based tubes. Then, the samples were kept frozen at -20 ̊C for later DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory procedures. The results of the mutation analyses of the CYP1A1 gene for the cancer and the healthy groups revealed that the occurrence frequencies of the homozygous wild type isoleucine/isoleucine were 52% and 26% respectively. While they were 42% and 60% respectively for the homozygous mutant Val/Val. Moreover, the heterozygous mutant Val/Ile type showed presence at 6% and 14% respectively. The statistical analyses confirmed that the incidence of the breast cancer could increase with genetic trait of the homozygous mutant Val/Val in a difference rate of 1.4 and confidence interval at 3.337-0.587. The findings of this study also declared that the women who carried the heterozygous mutant Val/Ile and their menstrual cycle started at the ages between 14-17 years old had 4 times of the risk factor of developing breast cancer. The study also revealed that there were no significant differences between the women who had breast cancer if they had early or late menopause. Finally, the study results showed that there was 3 times risk factor of developing breast cancer in uneducated women when linked to the genotypic trait Val/Ile in a difference rate of 3.2 and confidence interval of 40.057-0.265. It has been concluded that the risk factor of breast cancer was increased in the uneducated women in the presence of the Val/Ile genotype. This could be reasoned to the lifestyle of exposing to chemicals, paints, smoking, and many environmental carcinogens. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation | International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.",

    "Abstract": "The incidence of indeterminate pulmonary nodules has risen constantly over the past few years. Determination of lung nodule malignancy is pivotal, because the early diagnosis of lung cancer could lead to a definitive intervention. According to the current international guidelines, size and growth rate represent the main indicators to determine the nature of a pulmonary nodule. However, there are some limitations in evaluating and characterising nodules when only their dimensions are taken into account. There is no single method for measuring nodules, and intrinsic errors, which can determine variations in nodule measurement and in growth assessment, do exist when performing measurements either manually or with automated or semi-automated methods. When considering subsolid nodules the presence and size of a solid component is the major determinant of malignancy and nodule management, as reported in the latest guidelines. Nevertheless, other nodule morphological characteristics have been associated with an increased risk of malignancy. In addition, the clinical context should not be overlooked in determining the probability of malignancy. Predictive models have been proposed as a potential means to overcome the limitations of a sized-based assessment of the malignancy risk for indeterminate pulmonary nodules. © ERS 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the possible correlation between the expression of examined protein markers - p53, EGFR, PCNA, p44/42 in the mass of the tumor and the clinical stage of disease. Material: 48 patients of the Department and Clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Lublin diagnosed with oral cancer. The control group consisted of 10 patients diagnosed with leukoplakia lesions in the oral cavity. The methods: Immunohistochemical analysis using the detection system DAKO K5007 Cat - Dako REAL ™ Detection System, Peroxidase DAB +, Rabbit / Mouse. Results: Based upon the statistical results, significant correlation between p53 protein and tumor staging; however, a correlation between the level of expression of EGFR, p44/42, PCNA and staging was not likewise revealed. Conclusions: Looking for oral squamous cell carcinoma markers remains an actual issue. Identification of specific markers of oral cancer could be used in screening the population, determining prognosis and response to treatment. © 2018 Fundacja Polski Przeglad Chirurgiczny.",

    "Abstract": "Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in intraperitoneal dissemination of colorectal carcinoma, pseudomyxoma peritonei or gastric cancer is becoming standard practice. The evaluation of the effectiveness of such management in other cancers is still the subject of clinical trials. It is particularly difficult to assess the effectiveness of CRS and HIPEC in the treatment of intraperitoneal spread of rare types of malignancies such as sarcomas or small intestine cancer. The available, mainly retrospective, studies have been reviewed and discussed. They confirm the efficacy of cytoreductive procedures, especially if complete surgical cytoreduction (CC-0/1) has been achieved, however, the effectiveness of HIPEC requires further prospective studies. © 2018 Fundacja Polski Przeglad Chirurgiczny.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Oral cancer ranks in the top three of all cancers in India, which accounts for over thirty per cent of all cancers reported in the country and oral cancer control is quickly becoming a global health priority. Early diagnosis is the most important single factor in combating oral cancer and improving the survival rate. Aim and objectives: To find out the prevalence of potentially malignant disorders (PMDs) of oral soft tissues in above 15 years age population and to find the biosocial determinants of PMDs of oral soft tissues. Material & Methods: Community based, cross sectional study, carried out in a randomly selected urban slum area of Agra, among 1254 individuals of more than 15 years of age. The individuals were interviewed, and oral cavity was examined to detect the PMDs of oral soft tissues. Results: The prevalence of PMDs of oral soft tissues was found 16.45%. Prevalence of sub mucosal fibrosis (SMF) is 10.61% followed by leukoplakia (5.11%) and erythroplakia 0.72%. Prevalence of PMDs in males is 23.22% which is much higher than females 8.24%. Prevalence of SMF is much higher in illiterates 19.01%. Unemployed individuals showed lower prevalence of PMDs i.e. 14.73% in comparison to semiskilled laborers 47.56%. PMD prevalence is higher in lower social classes 17.55%. Conclusion: Prevalence of PMDs is higher in males and illiterates. PMDs of oral soft tissues showed statistically significant increase in prevalence with advancing age. Statistically significantly lower prevalence is found in unemployed and housewives. Prevalence is high among laborers and lower social classes. © 2017, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Oncoplastic and reconstructive techniques are essential tools in the armamentarium of contemporary breast surgeons. The aim of the study was to identify oncoplastic reconstructive patterns in breast cancer centers across Poland. A questionnaire of 18 questions was sent by email to the members of the Polish Society of Surgical Oncology and the Polish Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and Esthetic Surgery via their dedicated websites. The numbers of breast cancer patients operated on in each center ranged from 120 to 904 per year. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) predominated in all but one center (range 50-70%). Immediate breast reconstructions (IBR) accounted for 6-42% of procedures, The most frequent type of IBR was either a two-stage expander followed by a permanent implant or one-stage implant- based with or without synthetic mesh. The most frequent type of delayed breast reconstruction (DBR) was a two- stage expander followed by implant- based reconstruction. None of the surveyed cancer centers performed free flap reconstruction. Deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps were performed in the plastic surgery department. Reconstructions based on pedicled flaps were performed in cancer centers. Acellular dermal matrices (ADM) and fat transfer were used in selected centers. In the clinical scenario of adjuvant radiotherapy, delayed breast reconstruction was favored. The full range of oncoplastic BCS was performed. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) and complications were assessed. Our findings can act as a platform for further improvement in skills, certification, data collection and audit, including patient reported expectation measures. There is also an urgent need to address pan-European inconsistencies in procedural reimbursement. © 2018 Fundacja Polski Przeglad Chirurgiczny.",

    "Abstract": "A Bacillus subtilis AB154 with anti-proliferation activity on human cancer cells was isolated from the fruit body of white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), when we studied the anti-tumor activity of A. bisporus mushroom. The peptide with proliferation inhibiting activity produced by endophyte Bacillus subtilis AB154 was extracted using ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography, followed by anti-tumor activity investigation. The results showed that it had a better inhibitory activity against the human colon cancer cell line Caco-2 with IC50 value of 109.94 μg/m L, while the inhibitory ability on human normal bronchial epithelial cell line NHBE was the lowest. Then a peptide component with anti-tumor ability was purified by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and its structure was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and electro spray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The result showed that the peptide produced by Bacillus subtilis AB154 belonged to the lipopeptide family of fengycin B1. This research first reported an fengycin B1 lipopeptide with anti-human colon cancer cell Caco-2 activity. The study of inhibitory mechanism showed that the cell cycle of Caco-2 cells treated with fengycin for 12 h were arrested in the G0/G1 phase, and the cell cycle was arrested in the S phase at 24 h. The fragmentation of nuclear chromatin within Caco-2 cells was induced by fengycin. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST. All right reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional medicine has explored the diverse pharmacological efficacy of Cajanus cajan leaves including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential. To scientifically validate the tumor inhibitory potential of Cajanus cajan leaves, the present study utilized the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis as an experimental oral cancer model. The ethanolic extract of Cajanus cajan leaves (CcELet) suppressed the tumor formation in the pre- initiation phase and reduced the formation of tumors and tumor size as well in the post-initiation phase. Also, the Cajanus cajan leaves modulated the status of lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, and phase I and phase II detoxification agents towards tumor inhibition in the hamsters treated with DMBA. The results of the study thus explore the anti-tumor potential of Cajanus cajan leaves during DMBA induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis. © J. K. Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancers among women worldwide. However, due to limited chemotherapeutic efficacy of current anticancer drugs, various natural products have been screened for novel alternative chemotherapeutic agents. Marine environment offers vast diversity of living organisms that provide compounds with impressive structural diversity and drug-like properties. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxic effects and mechanisms of cell death exerted by marine sponges on human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Four species, namely Aaptos sp., Stryphuous ponderosus, Theonella sp. and Xestospongia sp, were selected for this study. Methanol extracts from three species produced potent cytotoxicity effects with IC50 values at 72hr of less than 30μg/ml in the order of Aaptos sp. > S. ponderosus > Theonella sp. Due to the lack of studies on S. ponderosus, extract from this species was then used to determine its mechanisms of cell death. MCF-7 cell death exerted by the extract was found to be mediated by apoptosis based on the presence of DNA fragmentation in treated cells. Treatment of cells with the extract increased the levels of of caspase 3 suggesting that the protein was responsible in triggering the DNA fragmentation. In addition, the extract also induced the levels of caspases 8 and 9 and the levels of caspase 8 was higher than the latter suggesting that extrinsic was the major pathway that involved in inducing apoptosis. The apoptotic-induced cytototoxicity activity of the methanol extract of S. ponderosus may be due to the presence alkaloid and terpenoid compounds, and thus, may have the potential to be developed further as candidates for chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation | International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.",

    "Abstract": "In 2014, we conducted a study aimed at screening the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and various trace elements in air and soil samples collected in an urban area of Sant Adrià de Besòs (Barcelona, Spain) in the vicinity of an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF). It consists of a mechanical-biological treatment plant (MBT) and an old municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI). Human health risks for the population living in the area were also assessed. The most worrying result was the high cancer risks estimated for the area (2.5 × 10− 6). In March 2017, we have carried out a new survey to check if the authorities had taken the necessary and urgent measures to reduce the environmental concentrations of PCDD/Fs -and the human health risks- until acceptable levels. Although the concentrations of PCDD/Fs in soils are currently lower (mean value: 1.66 vs. 3.6 ng WHO-TEQ/kg in 2014), they are still are notably higher than those found near other MSWIs of Catalonia. In turn, the levels of PCDD/Fs in air are even higher than in 2014 (mean value: 0.044 vs. 0.026 pg WHO-TEQ/m3 in 2014), being also the highest detected in similar zones of Catalonia. The current cancer risk due to PCDD/F exposure for the residents in the neighborhood of the IWMF is 2.3 × 10− 6, a worrying fact as the 10− 6 threshold continues to be exceeded. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been used to preserve the integrity of historical buildings or to protect collections of artefacts at potentially large volumes and often without detailed application records. Previous research has focused on the efficiency of remediation at contaminated sites (where identified), as well as improvement of preservation techniques and workplace health and safety. Few studies have assessed the human health risks from occupational exposure to OCPs in buildings of cultural and historical importance. Thus, potential risks may remain unidentified. In the present study, OCPs in indoor air were measured in a baroque theatre and a natural history museum in the Czech Republic, both of which had suspected past indoor application. In the theatre attic p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE) levels in air were up to 190 ng m− 3, confirming past indoor use of p,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p′-DDT). There was also evidence of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) use in the theatre (max γ-HCH in air of 56 ng m− 3). Yet, the cancer risk (CR) from occupational exposure via inhalation (Expi) to OCPs in the theatre was low (CR &lt; 4.0 × 10− 6). γ-HCH was found at elevated levels in air of the museum (max γ-HCH in air of 15,000 ng m− 3). CR from Expi in the museum was moderate to high (&gt; 1 × 10− 4). Our results show the CR through Expi to OCPs in buildings, such as museums can still be significant enough to warrant mitigation measures, e.g., remediation. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Glycoproteins play a pivotal role in the maintenance of cellular integrity and thus alterations in the status of glycoproteins could lead to several pathological conditions including malignant transformation. The aim of the present study is to explore the effect of the ethanolic extract of the Cissus quadrangularis leaves on the plasma and buccal mucosa glycoproteins in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis. Oral carcinoma was induced in the hamsters’ buccal pouch using the site specific carcinogen, DMBA (3 times a week for 14 weeks, topical application). Plasma and buccal mucosa glycoproteins were found to be enhanced in both the plasma and buccal mucosa of hamsters treated with DMBA alone (tumor bearing hamsters). The status of glycoproteins was found to be reverted in hamsters treated with DMBA + Cissus quadrangularis leaves. The present results thus reveal the defensive role of the Cissus quadrangularis leaves in preserving the cellular integrity during DMBA induced oral carcinogenesis. © J. K.

    "Abstract": "Accounting for as much as 14% of all lung cancers worldwide, cumulative radon progeny exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer among never-smokers both internationally and in the United States. To understand the risk of radon progeny exposure, studies have mapped radon potential using aircraft-based measurements of gamma emissions. However, these efforts are hampered in urban areas where the built environment obstructs aerial data collection. To address part of this limitation, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using in situ gamma readings (taken with a scintillation probe attached to a ratemeter) to assess radon potential in an urban environment: DeKalb County, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area, Georgia, USA. After taking gamma measurements at 402 survey sites, empirical Bayesian kriging was used to create a continuous surface of predicted gamma readings for the county. We paired these predicted gamma readings with indoor radon concentration data from 1351 residential locations. Statistical tests showed the interpolated gamma values were significantly but weakly positively related with indoor radon concentrations, though this relationship is decreasingly informative at finer geographic scales. Geology, gamma readings, and indoor radon were interrelated, with granitic gneiss generally having the highest gamma readings and highest radon concentrations and ultramafic rock having the lowest of each. Our findings indicate the highest geogenic radon potential may exists in the relatively undeveloped southeastern part of the county. It is possible that in situ gamma, in concert with other variables, could offer an alternative to aerial radioactivity measurements when determining radon potential, though future work will be needed to address this project's limitations. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "About 10% to 15% of patients with colon cancer have intraperitoneal metastases at diagnosis. The patients with intraperitoneal metastases and without distant metastases can benefit from cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Because up to a half of patients live for at least 5 years after this treatment, the treatment is used more and more often. The treatment of patients with intraperitoneal metastases with CRS and HIPEC costs more than the majority of other medical procedures, because CRS is extensive and takes a lot of time, and after surgery, patients need intensive care and expensive medications and equipment. Currently, only 40% to 80% of costs of CRS and HIPEC are reimbursed in Poland. Because CRS and HIPEC mean a financial loss to hospitals, they are rarely performed. We analyzed the costs of treating patients with peritoneal metastases by CRS and HIPEC in two centers (Gdank, Wroclaw) and showed how this treatment is reimbursed outside Poland. We discussed whether adequate qualification of patients and experience of the teams giving the treatment could reduce the costs. © 2018 Fundacja Polski Przeglad Chirurgiczny.",

    "Abstract": "Seventy saliva samples, seventy urine samples, seventy nail samples, seventy hair samples, eight drinking water samples and ninety-three crop samples were collected from four villages of the Hetao Basin in Inner Mongolia to determine arsenic (As) exposure biomarkers and evaluate relationship between As uptake and human health risk. Trivalent As (As(III)), pentavalent As (As(V)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenobetaine (AsB) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) were found in all urine samples. Only As(III) and As(V) were detected in saliva samples. In nail and hair samples, DMA, MMA, As(III) and As(V) were observed. Based on total As contents in crops and drinking water, the local residents’ daily intake of total arsenic (TDIAs), the hazard quotient (HQ), and the cancer risk (R) were assessed. Male, older and cases of skin lesion participants generally had higher As contents in saliva, urine, nail and hair samples in relative to others. Salivary, urinary, nail and hair As were not significantly affected by body mass index (BMI) and smoking. Good correlations were observed between TDIAs and salivary, urinary, nail and hair As, showing that saliva, urine, nail and hair samples can be used as biomarkers of As exposure. Individually, levels of arsenicosis were positively correlated with TDIAs. The relationship between TDIAs and prevalence of arsenicosis concluded that, although As levels in crops and drinking water did not exceed national standards, they still pose a potential threat to human health. It was suggested that the maximum permissible levels of crop As and drinking water As should be re-evaluated for protecting human health. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Nanoparticle-based cellular probes are commonly designed via covalent conjugation with affinity biomolecules. Those nanobioconjugates selectively interact with cell surface receptors and induce endocytosis followed by intracellular trafficking. However, this approach requires functional modification of biomolecules that may alter their biochemical activity. Here, we show that supramolecular host-guest chemistry can be utilized as an alternative approach in nanoparticle functionalization and selective cell labeling. We have used cyclodextrin-conjugated quantum dots (QDs) for supramolecular host-guest interaction-based functionalization with folate (QD-folate) and riboflavin (QD-riboflavin), where cyclodextrin acts as a host for the folate/riboflavin guest. We demonstrate that QD-folate and QD-riboflavin selectively label cells that have over-expressed folate/riboflavin receptors and induce the endocytosis pathway similar to covalently conjugated folate-/riboflavin-based nanoprobes. However, labeling is highly sensitive to the molar ratio of folate/riboflavin to cyclodextrin and incubation time. The presented functionalization/labeling approach is unique as it does not require covalent conjugation and may be extended for in vivo targeting application via simultaneous delivery of host and guest molecules. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "More than 50% of sepsis cases are associated with pneumonia. Sepsis is caused by infiltration of bacteria into the blood via inflammation, which is triggered by the release of cell wall components following lysis. However, the regulatory mechanism of lysis during infection is not well defined. Mice were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 wild-type (WT) and lipase mutant (ΔlipA) intranasally (pneumonia model) or intraperitoneally (sepsis model), and survival rate and pneumococcal colonization were determined. LipA and autolysin (LytA) levels were determined by qPCR and western blotting. S. pneumoniae Spd_1447 in the D39 (type 2) strain was identified as a lipase (LipA). In the sepsis model, but not in the pneumonia model, mice infected with the ΔlipA displayed higher mortality rates than did the D39 WT-infected mice. Treatment of pneumococci with serum induced LipA expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. In the presence of serum, the ΔlipA displayed faster lysis rates and higher LytA expression than the WT, both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that a pneumococcal lipase (LipA) represses autolysis via inhibition of LytA in a sepsis model.",

    "Abstract": "Unlike conventional optics, plasmonics enables unrivaled concentration of optical energy well beyond the diffraction limit of light. However, a significant part of this energy is dissipated as heat. Plasmonic losses present a major hurdle in the development of plasmonic devices and circuits that can compete with other mature technologies. Until recently, they have largely kept the use of plasmonics to a few niche areas where loss is not a key factor, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering and biochemical sensing. Here, we discuss the origin of plasmonic losses and various approaches to either minimize or mitigate them based on understanding of fundamental processes underlying surface plasmon modes excitation and decay. Along with the ongoing effort to find and synthesize better plasmonic materials, optical designs that modify the optical powerflow through plasmonic nanostructures can help in reducing both radiative damping and dissipative losses of surface plasmons. Another strategy relies on the development of hybrid photonic-plasmonic devices by coupling plasmonic nanostructures to resonant optical elements. Hybrid integration not only helps to reduce dissipative losses and radiative damping of surface plasmons, but also makes possible passive radiative cooling of nanodevices. Finally, we review emerging applications of thermoplasmonics that leverage Ohmic losses to achieve new enhanced functionalities. The most successful commercialized example of a loss-enabled novel application of plasmonics is heat-assisted magnetic recording. Other promising technological directions include thermal emission manipulation, cancer therapy, nanofabrication, nanomanipulation, plasmon-enabled material spectroscopy and thermo-catalysis, solar water treatment, and thermophotovoltaics. © 2017 Optical Society of America.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical presentation, operative data, and early and late outcomes of a large patient cohort undergoing surgical treatment for cardiac tumors in our institution. Material/Methods: A total of 181 patients underwent surgery because of suspected cardiac tumor in our institution between 1998 and 2016. In 162 cases, the diagnosis was confirmed postoperatively and these patients were included in this study. Preoperative baseline characteristics, operative data, and postoperative early and long-term outcomes were analyzed. Results: Mean age at presentation was 56.6±17.6 years, and 95 (58.6%) patients were female. There were 126 (77.8%) patients with benign cardiac tumors, while the remaining patients had malignant tumors (primary and metas-tasized). The mean follow-up time was 5.2±4.7 years. The most frequent histologically verified tumor type was myxoma (63%, n=102). In terms of malignant tumors, various types of sarcomas presented most primary malignant cardiac tumors (7.4%, n=12). The mean ICU length of stay was 1.7±2.2 days and overall in-hospital mortality was 3.1% (n=5). Frequent postoperative complications included mediastinal bleeding (5.8%, n=9), wound infection (1.3%, n=2), acute renal failure (5.6%, n=9), and major cerebrovascular events (n=7, 4.6%). The overall cumulative survival after cardiac tumor resection was 94% at 30 days, 85% at 1 year, 72% at 5 years, and 59% at 15 years. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of cardiac tumors is a safe and highly effective strategy associated with good early and long-term outcomes. © Med Sci Monit.",

    "Abstract": "The endocannabinoid system, comprising the cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2), their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids), and the proteins that regulate endocannabinoid biosynthesis and degradation, controls several physiological and pathological functions. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that endocannabinoids influence the intracellular events controlling the proliferation and apoptosis of numerous types of cancer cells, thereby leading to both in vitro and in vivo antitumour effects. Also, the endogenous ligand arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide; AEA) inhibits the proliferation of human breast cancer cells by blocking the G0/G1-S-phase transition of the cell cycle through interference with cannabinoid CB1 receptor-coupled signal-transducing events. The present review shows that cannabinoids exert their anti-cancer effects in a number of ways and in a variety of tissues. Furthermore, the novel therapeutic application of cannabinoids in cancer disease, described here, strongly support the idea that cannabinoids may induce benefical effect in cancer treatment. © 2017, SILAE (Italo-Latin American Society of Ethnomedicine).

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates promoter methylation of the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a biomarker in a cohort of 383 colorectal cancer patients. PD-L1 methylation (mPD-L1) was inversely correlated with PD-L1 mRNA expression (p D 0.001) and was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (OS, p D 0.003) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, p < 0.001). In age-stratified multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses including sex, tumor, nodal, distant metastasis categories, microsatellite instability (MSI)-status, and PD-L1 mRNA, mPD-L1 is classified as an independent prognostic factor (OS: p D 0.030; RFS: p < 0.001). Further studies are needed to evaluate PD-L1 methylation as a biomarker for response prediction of immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs are emerging as critical regulators in various fundamental biological processes, including tumor progression. MicroRNA-219-5p (miR-219-5p) has been suggested as a novel tumor suppressing miRNA for many types of human cancers. However, the expression and functional significance of miR-219-5p in epithelial ovarian cancer remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to explore the potential functions of miR-219-5p in epithelial ovarian cancer. Herein, we found that miR-219-5p levels were significantly decreased in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Further experiments showed that overexpression of miR-219-5p inhibited epithelial ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. By contrast, suppression of miR-219-5p exhibited the opposite effects. Twist was identified as a downstream target of miR-219-5p, and its expression was directly regulated by miR-219-5p. Restoration of Twist expression in miR-219-5p-overexpresing cells significantly reversed the antitumor effects of miR-219-5p. Taken together, our results revealed a tumor suppressive role for miR-219-5p in epithelial ovarian cancer that includes suppression of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through downregulation of the Twist/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our study suggests that miR-219-5p may have potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The aim of the study was to analyze the profile of patients who reported for free screening examinations during the 4th European Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Week to the Department of Otolaryngology, Miedzylesie Specialist Hospital, Warsaw, Poland. Material and methods: We enrolled 225 patients, aged 26-92 years (mean, 63 years). There were 149 women (66%) and 76 men (34%). All patients filled out a survey regarding risk factors of head and neck cancer (HNC), including symptoms and lifestyle characteristics. Subsequently, all participants underwent a complete laryngological examination. Results: Among the studied patients, we found the following lifestyle-related risk factors of HNC: Tobacco use (22%), alcohol use more than 1 time per week (12%), oral sex (17%), multiple sexual partners (10%), rare dental checkups (24%), and dental prostheses (45%). The most frequent symptoms that prompted the patients to report for screening exams were as follows: chronic hoarseness (64%), xerostomia (39%), dysphagia (37%), nasal congestion (6%), and neck tumor (5%). Further imaging studies were ordered in 15 patients (7%), fiberoscopy in 25 (11%), and lesion excision in 18 (8%). Among the studied patients, 17 were referred for further oncological treatment, of whom 14 had benign tumors and 4 malignant tumors. Conclusions: The Head and Neck Cancer Awareness campaign increased the awareness of HNC, and it should systematically encompass people at increased risk. By implementing this program in our department, we were able to detect and initiate early treatment in 7.5% of the screened people. However, appropriate workup and treatment require funding and therefore systemic measures should be taken to enable a wide implementation of such screening programs.",

Material: There was performed retrospective analysis of 97 patients, aged 17 to 88 years, mean age of 60.3 years. The analysis included data from subjective study, physical examination, image and histopathological studies Results: Almost all cases were lymphoid neoplasms - 95 patients (98%). B cell lymphoma was the most commonly diagnosed lymphoma - 74 cases (76%), followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma- 19 cases (20%). Only two patients had T-cell lymphoma (2%). There was observed prevalence among women, K: M ratio for the whole group was 51: 46, while male predominance was reported in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (K: M = 7: 12). Over the 15-year period, there was an increase in the number of lymphoid tumors. The most common location on the neck were lymph nodes - 71 (73.2%). Extranodal localizations (26.8%) were most often associated with salivary glands: parotid and submandibular involvement and with the dominant lymphoma of the marginal zone MALT (14 cases). In 57% of patients the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results were false, with positive results only in 32% of patients. Conclusions: Tumors from lymphoid tissue in the neck region are most commonly B-cell lymphomas or Hodgkin,s lymphomas. Non-specific clinical signs and non-specific radiological images, as well as non-diagnostic results o FNAB, make it difficult to effectively differentiate lymphomas with cancer metastasis in neck lymph nodes. Histopathology results of the excised lymph nodes remains a standard for lymphoma diagnosis. Copyright © 2017 Polish Society of Otorhinolaryngologists Head and Neck Surgeons.

    "Abstract": "RBJ has been identified to be dysregulated in gastrointestinal cancer and promotes tumorigenesis and progression by mediating nuclear accumulation of active MEK1/2 and sustained activation of ERK1/2. Considering that nuclear accumulation and constitutive activation of MEK/ERK not only promotes tumor progression directly, but also induces chronic inflammation, we wonder whether and how RBJ impairs host immune-surveillance via chronic inflammation and consequently supports tumor progression. Here, we report that higher expression of RBJ in human breast cancer tissue has been significantly correlated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. The forced expression of RBJ promotes tumor growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, more accumulation of immune suppressive cells but less antitumor immune cell subpopulations were found in spleen and tumor tissue derived from RBJ forceexpressed tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, forced RBJ expression significantly promotes tumor cell production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 by constitutive activating MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Accordingly, RBJ knockdown significantly decreases tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, with markedly reduced production of IL-6. Administration of anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody could reduce MDSCs accumulation in tumor tissue in vivo. Therefore, our results demonstrate that RBJ-mediated nuclear constitutive activation of ERK1/2 leads to persistent production of IL-6 and increase of MDSCs recruitment, contributing to promotion of tumor growth and metastasis. These results suggest that RBJ contributes to tumor immune escape, maybe serving a potential target for design of antitumor drug. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Salivary gland tumors are rare and comprise 3-10% of all tumors of the head and neck. Materials and methods: Between 2006 and 2016, 149 patients with parotid gland tumors were treated in our department. Our report is based on medical records, histopathological examinations, and surgery reports. Results: We found 126 benign and 23 malignant tumors, and both tumor types were seen more frequently in men. The mean age of all patients was 58.3 years; it was 65.5 years for patients with malignant tumors and 56.9 years for those with benign tumors. Among the analyzed patients, the peak incidence was seen in the age range of 60-69 years. Moreover, this age range was approximately the same for all tumors and benign tumors, whereas for malignant tumors it was 70-79 years. Benign tumors were significantly more frequent, and comprised 84.56% of all tumors. The most common benign tumors were pleomorphic adenoma and adenolymphoma, accounting for 93.66% of cases. The most common malignant tumors were as follows: polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (26.07%), NOS adenocarcinoma (13.04%), and acinic cell carcinoma (13.04%). The most common treatment modality was standalone surgery. Conclusions: Our retrospective analysis is in line with previous national and international studies.

    "Abstract": "While RNA-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines have shown promise, the advancement of cellular therapeutics is fraught with developmental challenges. To circumvent the challenges of cellular immunotherapeutics, we developed clinically translatable nanoliposomes that can be combined with tumor-derived RNA to generate personalized tumor RNA-nanoparticles (NPs) with considerable scale-up capacity. RNA-NPs bypass MHC restriction, are amenable to central distribution, and can provide near immediate immune induction. We screened commercially available nanoliposomal preparations and identified the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) as an efficient mRNA courier to antigen-presenting cells (APCs). When administered intravenously, RNA-NPs mediate systemic activation of APCs in reticuloendothelial organs such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. RNA-NPs increase percent expression of MHC class I/II, B7 co-stimulatory molecules, and maturation markers on APCs (all vital for T-cell activation). RNA-NPs also increase activation markers on tumor APCs and elicit potent expansion of antigen-specific T-cells superior to peptide vaccines formulated in complete Freund's adjuvant. We demonstrate that both model antigen-encoding and physiologically-relevant tumor-derived RNA-NPs expand potent antitumor T-cell immunity. RNA-NPs were shown to induce antitumor efficacy in a vaccine model and functioned as a suitable alternative to DCs in a stringent cellular immunotherapy model for a radiation/temozolomide resistant invasive murine high-grade glioma. Although cancer vaccines have suffered from weak immunogenicity, we have advanced a RNA-NP formulation that systemically activates host APCs precipitating activated T-cell frequencies necessary to engender antitumor efficacy. RNA-NPs can thus be harnessed as a more feasible and effective immunotherapy to re-program host-immunity. © Elias J.

    "Abstract": "There is a critical unmet clinical need for bladder cancer immunotherapies capable of inducing durable antitumor immunity. We have shown that four intravesical treatments with a simple co-formulation of interleukin-12 and the biopolymer chitosan not only destroy orthotopic bladder tumors, but also promote a potent long-lasting systemic immune response as evidenced through tumor-specific in vitro killing assays, complete protection from rechallenge, and abscopal antitumor responses at distant non-treated tumors. This study investigates the immunological kinetics underlying these results. We show through depletion studies that CD8C T cells are required for initial tumor rejection, but CD4C T cells protect against rechallenge. We also show that even a single intravesical treatment can eliminate tumors in 50% of mice with 6/9 and 7/8 mice eliminating tumors after three or four treatments respectively. We then performed immunophenotyping studies to analyze shifts in immune cell populations after each treatment within the tumor itself as well as in secondary lymphoid organs. These studies demonstrated an initial infiltration of macrophages and granulocytes followed by increased CD4C and CD8C effector-memory cells. This was coupled with a decreased level of regulatory T cells in peripheral lymph nodes as well as decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration in the bladder. Taken together, these data demonstrate the ability of properly delivered interleukin-12-based therapies to engage adaptive immunity within the tumor itself as well as throughout the body and strengthen the case for clinical translation of chitosan/ interleukin-12 as an intravesical treatment for bladder cancer. © Sean G.

    "Abstract": "Tumors develop mechanisms to recruit tolerogenic immune cells and to induce the expression of molecules that act as immune checkpoints. This regulation of the immune microenvironment favors immune tolerance to the neoplastic cells. In this study, we have investigated the prognostic role of immune-checkpoint expression markers in a cohort of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen lung specimens (tumor and normal lung) (n D 178). RTqPCR was performed to analyze the relative expression of 20 immune-related genes that were normalized by the use of endogenous genes selected by GeNorm algorithm. Patients with higher expression levels of IL23A and LGALS2 presented better outcomes. In the clustering expression patterns, we observed that patients with higher expression of immunoregulatory genes had better survival rates. Additionally, these data were used to develop a gene expression score. Since CTLA4 and PD1 were associated with prognosis based on Cox regression analysis (Z-score > 1.5), a multivariate model including these two genes was created. Absolute regression coefficients from this analysis were used in order to calculate the immunecheckpoint score: (PD1£0.116) C (CTLA4£0.059) for each case. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high immune-checkpoint score have longer overall survival (OS) [NR vs. 40.4 mo, p D 0.008] and longer relapse-free survival (RFS) [82.6 vs. 23 mo, p D 0.009]. Multivariate analysis in the entire cohort indicated that the immune-checkpoint score was an independent biomarker of prognosis for OS [HR: 0.308; 95% CI, 0.156–0.609; p D 0.001] and RFS [HR: 0.527; 95% CI, 0.298–0.933; p D 0.028] in early-stage NSCLC patients. In conclusion, this score provides relevant prognostic information for a better characterization of early stage NSCLS patients with strikingly different outcomes and who may be candidates for immune-based therapies. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes the harmful effects on skin by the photochemical reaction and gene expression regulation. Recent evidences have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in a diverse range of biological functions. However, research on the effects of UV irradiation on lncRNA expression in epidermal cells is limited. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the expression profile of lncRNAs after UVB irradiation. To accomplish this, we performed a microarray analysis of both mRNA and lncRNA expression levels in irradiated skin cells. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs showed that the expression of immune response- and cell membrane-related genes was up-regulated, while cell-cell adhesion-associated genes were down-regulated by UVB irradiation. Moreover, we found that lncRNAs up-regulated by UVB irradiation were associated with the regulation of gene transcription, while lncRNAs down-regulated by UVB irradiation were associated with tumorigenesis. Finally, we compiled a list of the lncRNAs that showed the strongest association with the development of non-melanoma skin cancers caused by UV exposure. These findings lay a foundation for future investigations into the expression patterns of lncRNAs with roles in the response to UV irradiation and in non-melanoma skin cancers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Malignant lymphoma (ML) is a neoplasm caused by clonal expansion of undifferentiated B, T and NK-lymphoid cells. WHO classification divides lymphomas into two main types, i.e. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with numerous subtypes. The majority of MLs are localized in lymph nodes, but extranodal locations are also possible. MLs represent approximately 3-5% of all malignant neoplasms in Poland, but their incidence has been increasing in recent years, especially in young patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate clinical manifestations and diagnostic process in patients with malignant lymphomas of the head and neck region as diagnosed in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Medical University of Lodz in years 2013-2017. Material and method: 30 patients diagnosed with malignant lymphomas of the head and neck region at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Medical University of Lodz in 2013-2017. Results: The study group consisted of 8 cases of nodal lymphomas and 22 cases of extranodal lymphomas. In 29 cases B-cell lymphomas were diagnosed. The most common symptoms included lymphadenopathy or neck tumor. Other symptoms were associated with the location of tumors in particular body organs. The diagnosis was based on histopathological examination of biopsy (needle or surgical) samples. Conclusion: Malignant lymphomas should be taken into account during differential diagnosis of the tumor or lymphadenopathy of the neck. The diagnosis is difficult because of the nonspecificity of symptoms and the need for interdisciplinary cooperation of many specialists.",

    "Abstract": "Self-assembly systems (SAS) mainly consist of micelles, and liposomes are the classes of Nano Drug Delivery Systems with superior properties compared to traditional therapeutics in targeting cancer tumors. All commercially available nano-formulations of chemotherapeutics currently consist of SAS. According to our knowledge, a specific toxicity comparison based on material differences has not yet been performed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the toxicity of two SAS consisting of Sterically Stabilized Micelles (SSM) made of a lipid-based amphiphilic distearoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-2000 and a polymeric micelle (PM) consisting of Y-shape amphiphilic block copolymer, synthesized using poly ε-caprolactone and PEG. The mechanism of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of micelles on L-929 healthy mouse fibroblast cells was assessed using Sulforhodamine-B, WST-1, Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis assays. Results showed that SSM in conc. of 40 mg/mL shows very low cytotoxicity at the end of 24, 48 and 72 h. The DNA damage caused by SSM was much lower than PM while the latter one showed significant toxicity by causing apoptosis with the ED50 value of 3 mg/mL. While the DNA damage caused by SSM was ignorable, some DNA chain breaks were detected on cells treated with PM. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common cancer with poor prognosis. Caveolin-1 (Cav1) and Rho/ROCK pathway play important roles in tumor metastasis, separately. However, less research was focused on the relationship between Cav1 and Rho/ROCK in ECSS metastasis. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between Cav1 and Rho/ROCK pathway in ESCC metastasis. Material/Methods: Cav1 and phosphorylated Cav1 (PY14Cav1) were examined in ESCC and in adjacent and non-tumorous tissues from ESCC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Cav1 or Rho/ROCK inhibitor was used to treat EC109, Eca109, TE1, and TE13 cells. Western blotting (WB) was used to detect Cav1 and PY14Cav1 expression. The wound healing scratch test and transwell assays were used to assess migration and invasion. Results: Cav1 and PY14Cav1 were gradually expressed at higher levels in ECSS than in adjacent and non-tumor tissues as ESCC stage and lymphatic metastasis increased, and this difference was significant (P<0.05). Cav1 was expressed at higher levels in TE1 and TE13 than in EC109 and Eca109, while PY14Cav1 was enhanced in TE1 and TE13 cells but not in EC109 and Eca109, and the difference was significant (P<0.05). TE1 and TE13 had significantly (P<0.05) stronger motility, migratory, and invasion abilities than EC109 and Eca109 cells. Silencing Cav1 decreased PY14Cav1 expression in TE1 and TE13 cells, as well as suppressing the migration and invasion of all ECSS cells, and these differences were significant (P<0.05). Suppressing the Rho/ROCK pathway obviously inhibited Cav1 and PY14Cav1 expressions, as well as significantly (P<0.05) decreasing migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Conclusions: Cav1 and PY14Cav1 were positively correlated with ESCC lymphatic metastasis and cancer stages. Rho/ROCK pathway activation promoted ESCC metastasis by regulating Cav1. © Med Sci Monit.",

    "Abstract": "The decay of a planar compact surface that is reduced through its boundary is considered. The interest of this problem lies in the fact that it can represent the destruction of a solid tumor by a population of immune cells. The theory of curves is utilized to derive the rate at which the area of the set decreases. Firstly, the process is represented as a discrete dynamical system. A recurrence equation describing the shrinkage of the area at any step is deduced. Then, a continuum limit is attained to derive an ordinary differential equation that governs the decay of the set. The solutions to the differential equation and its implications are discussed, and numerical simulations are carried out to test the accuracy of the decay law. Finally, the dynamics of a tumor-immune aggregate is inspected using this law and the theory of bifurcations. As the ratio of immune destruction to tumor growth increases, a saddle-node bifurcation stabilizes the tumor-free fixed point. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

    "Abstract": "Alternative pre-mRNA splicing increases transcriptome plasticity by forming naturally-occurring alternative splicing variants (ASVs). Alterations of splicing processes, caused by DNA mutations, result in aberrant splicing and the formation of aberrant mRNA isoforms. Analyses of hereditary cancer predisposition genes reveal many DNA variants with unknown clinical significance (VUS) that potentially affect pre-mRNA splicing. Therefore, a comprehensive description of ASVs is an essential prerequisite for the interpretation of germline VUS in high-risk individuals. To identify ASVs in a gene of interest, we have proposed an approach based on multiplex PCR (mPCR) amplification of all theoretically possible exon-exon junctions and subsequent characterization of size-selected and pooled mPCR products by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The efficiency of this method is illustrated by a comprehensive analysis of BRCA1 ASVs in human leukocytes, normal mammary, and adipose tissues and stable cell lines. We revealed 94 BRCA1 ASVs, including 29 variants present in all tested samples. While differences in the qualitative expression of BRCA1 ASVs among the analyzed human tissues were minor, larger differences were detected between tissue and cell line samples.

    "Abstract": "With advancements in machine learning algorithms and computer aided diagnostic (CAD) systems, the performance of automated analysis of radiological images has improved substantially in recent times. However, the lack of integration between the radiologist and CAD systems restrains the rate of progress as well as the reach of such advancements in clinical use. This article aims to improve the clinical efficiency of ultrasound based CAD systems for classification of breast lesions by integrating back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), support vector machine (SVM) and radiologist feedback. The acquired breast ultrasound images were subjected to wavelet based filtering in order to reduce speckle noise followed by feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Experiments on a database of 178 ultrasound images of breast anomalies (88 benign and 90 malignant) show that the proposed methodology achieves classification accuracy of 98.621% and 98.276%, respectively, when all 457 and 19 most relevant features selected by multi-criteria feature selection method were used for classification. The accuracy achieved is significantly higher than that using conventional classifiers based on BPANN and SVM. Further, it is found that integrating expert opinion in CAD systems improves its overall performance. The quantitative results obtained are discussed in light of some recently reported studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Chitosan is a natural cationic polysaccharide, which is often used for preparing biomedical materials because of its high biocompatibility. In this study, chitosan with different molecular weights was chosen to prepare chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) as gene vector by ionic cross-linking with tripolyphosphate (TPP). CSNPs were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI) by the Zetasizer, and morphology was detected with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of CSNPs were correspondingly examined by MTT assay and the muscle slices of mice. The transfer effect on plasmids and siRNA was evaluated. Agarose gel electrophoresis method and spectrophotometry were used to detect the loading efficiency. The cell transfection efficiency of plasmids or siRNA loaded by CSNPs was analyzed by the fluorescence microscopy, laser scanning confocal microscopy or flow cytometry. The blood compatibility was analyzed by hemolytic experiment and full-automatic blood coagulator. Results showed that when CS(160 kDa) was 1 mg/mL with TTP(mass ratio was 10:1), CSNPs were prepared successfully by ionic gelation method, which had smaller particle size (about 100 nm), stable dispersibility, high gene loading efficiency and spheroidal particles with morphological rules under TEM. Their cytotoxicity is at the 0-1 level, which is in line with the toxicity standard of biomedical materials. No obvious inflammatory reaction was found in the tissue section, showing good tissue-biocompatibility. CSNPs could transfer the plasmids or siRNA to cells with high loading rate. However, CSNPs might have much higher transfecting efficiency for siRNA than plasmids, which implied that CSNPs might be more suitable for being a safe and efficient vector for delivering siRNA than plasmids.The results of flow cytometry showed that the transfection rate was higher than that of commercial transfection reagents. Results also showed that CSNPs had good blood compatibility, so it can be applied as a safe and efficient siRNA delivery vector in cancer therapies. © 2017, Chongqing Functional Materials Periodical Press Co.

    "Abstract": "Hedyotis diffusa, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, possesses anti-cancer, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study is to explore the anti-tumor potential of Hedyotis diffusa polysaccharides (HDP) in human larynx squamous carcinoma. High performance size-exclusion chromatography analysis indicated the homogeneous nature of HDP. Total carbohydrate content in HDP was 97.3%, without contamination of protein and nucleic acid. HDP suppressed the proliferation of Hep2 human larynx squamous carcinoma cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that exposure to HDP (400 μg/ml) caused a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, treatment with HDP for 24 h induced a significant apoptosis of Hep2 cells, which was accompanied by increased cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and reduced expression of Bcl-2 protein. Additionally, HDP inhibited cell migration and suppressed the expression of MMP-2 and μPA. In conclusion, HDP shows suppressive effects against the aggressive phenotypes of human larynx squamous carcinoma cells and may have therapeutic potential for this malignancy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are selective therapies for the patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Imatinib and ponatinib have remarkable long-term efficacy on a major molecular response. Although TKI related induction of cytotoxicity and apoptosis have been clearly investigated in molecular levels, their comparative effect on autophagy and miRNome are largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of alterations of miRNA expressions in CML progression, and how imatinib and ponatinib affect this process, by comparing CML, imatinib-resistant CML and leukemia stem cells (LSC). Cytotoxicity analysis was conducted by WST-1, apoptosis was evaluated by AnnexinV, autophagy was analyzed by Tb/GFP TR-FRET LC3B assay and changes in miRNomes were evaluated with microarray method. Ponatinib showed higher cytotoxicity and apoptosis at far fewer concentrations than imatinib. Both imatinib and ponatinib was able to trigger autophagy in imatinib-resistant K562ima3 cell line but not in LSC. We pointed that imatinib and ponatinib caused significant miRNA profile alterations, especially in the expressions of miR-214-pre, miR-218, miR-19a-5p, miR-19b-1-5p, miR-27b-pre, miR-23b-pre, miR-320e, miR-200a-pre, miR-508-3p, miR-33-pre and miR-766. This study is the first comparative miRNome analysis of CML, resistant CML and LSCs following the imatinib or ponatinib treatment and may guide to identify new markers for diagnosis, follow-up of the disease and to develop novel therapeutic strategies if supported by preclinical studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction. Since the 20th century tobacco smoking has had an enormous impact on morbidity and mortality in the adult population, and it remains the greatest single preventable health risk factor worldwide. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Poland, with lung cancer as the primary cause of cancer-related death in Polish men and women. Given these statistics, this manuscript aims to estimate tobacco-Attributable cancer mortality in Poland. Material and methods. Data on cancer mortality come from the WHO Mortality Statistics database. Data on smoking prevalence in Poland come from standardized surveys based on nationally representative samples. Data on relative risks come from the Cancer Prevention Study II. Tobacco-Attributable fractions were calculated using standard methodology for calculating population-based attributable fractions. Results. In 2014, there were over 24 thousand tobacco-Attributed cancer deaths in men. Lung cancer tops the list of ranked cancer types, with a tobacco-Attributable fraction of 93%. Next is laryngeal (TAF = 90%), oropharyngeal (TAF = 86%) and esophageal (TAF = 80%) cancer. Overall, two-Thirds of the considered cancer deaths were attributed to tobacco smoke (TAF = 75%). In 2014, there were over 7.5 thousand of cancer deaths related to smoking in women. Here, both laryngeal and lung cancer (both TAF = 76%) top the ranked list. Next are esophageal (TAF = 61%) and oropharyngeal (TAF = 51%) cancers, and when combined almost half of all considered cancer deaths were attributed to tobacco smoke (TAF = 44%). Conclusions. Tobacco smoking and tobacco-Attributable cancer mortality remain one of the greatest health burdens in Poles. Each year over 30 thousand Polish men and women die of cancer caused by smoking. All these deaths could be avoided.",

    "Abstract": "Incidence of colorectal cancer is high worldwide and it mostly occurs as an accumulation of environmental factors and genetic alterations. Hereditary colorectal cancer can develop as a part of a hereditary syndrome. There is a suspected correlation between colorectal cancer and allelic variants of the POLE and POLD1 genes. The aim of the present study was to look for associations between the allelic variants in the POLE and POLD1 genes and colorectal cancer. One thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine DNA samples from colorectal cancer patients were collected from 2002 to 2013. Samples were divided in three groups: hereditary colorectal cancer patients, patients with different hereditary cancer syndromes in their families and patients with no cancer history in their families. The DNA samples were screened for allelic variants of POLE rs483352909 and POLD1 rs39751463 using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). All patients were negative for allelic variants rs483352909 of the POLE gene and rs397514632 of the POLD1 gene. One allelic variant rs373243003 in the POLE gene and one novel duplication of four nucleotides at the excision site between intron and exon (c.1384-5dupCCTA) in the POLD1 gene, was found. We could not detect or confirm the connection between the genetic variants in the POLD1 and POLE genes and colorectal cancer patients, but we detected a novel genetic variant with an unknown significance. © 2017 Pätzold LA, Berziņa D, Daneberga Z, Gardovskis J, Miklaševičs E.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Danshen is a common traditional Chinese medicine used to treat neoplastic and chronic inflammatory diseases in China. However, the effects of Danshen on human oral cancer cells remain relatively unknown. This study investigated the antiproliferative effects of a Danshen extract on human oral cancer SAS, SCC25, OEC-M1, and KB drug-resistant cell lines and elucidated the possible underlying mechanism. Methods: We investigated the anticancer potential of the Danshen extract in human oral cancer cell lines and an in vivo oral cancer xenograft mouse model. The expression of apoptosis-related molecules was evaluated through Western blotting, and the concentration of in vivo apoptotic markers was measured using immunohistochemical staining. The antitumor effects of 5-fluorouracil and the Danshen extract were compared. Results: Cell proliferation assays revealed that the Danshen extract strongly inhibited oral cancer cell proliferation. Cell morphology studies revealed that the Danshen extract inhibited the growth of SAS, SCC25, and OEC-M1 cells by inducing apoptosis. The Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the Danshen extract induced cell cycle G0/G1 arrest. Immunoblotting analysis for the expression of active caspase-3 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein indicated that Danshen extract-induced apoptosis in human oral cancer SAS cells was mediated through the caspase pathway. Moreover, the Danshen extract significantly inhibited growth in the SAS xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, the Danshen extract circumvented drug resistance in KB drug-resistant oral cancer cells. Conclusion: The study results suggest that the Danshen extract could be a potential anticancer agent in oral cancer treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Postoperative radiation (PORT) is an option for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with resectable stage IIIA pathological N2 status (pN2). For patients with PORT, this study aims to investigate the impact of the exact number of positive lymph nodes (LNs) on overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS). Methods: Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified 3373 patients with stage IIIA pathological N2 status (pN2) NSCLC who underwent a lobectomy or pneumonectomy from 2004 to 2013. OS and LCSS were compared among patients coded as receiving PORT or observation. The proportional hazards model was applied for investigation. Results: OS and LCSS favored PORT for patients with stage IIIA (pN2) NSCLC. Multivariable analyses showed that PORT and the exact number of positive LNs (n≤3) were independently associated with better OS and LCSS. Both better OS and LCSS emerged for positive LNs (n>3) after the use of PORT in survival analyses, whereas the benefits of OS and LCSS were not observed anymore for positive LNs (n≤3) group. More importantly, multivariable analyses showed that the use of PORT is an independent risk factor of survival for positive LNs (n>3) but not for positive LNs (n≤3). Conclusions: In Stage IIIA (pN2) NSCLC, the use of PORT demonstrated better survival results than no PORT for patients with positive LNs (n>3), but not for patients with positive LNs (n≤3). © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the most widely used tumor markers, and its value in the surveillance of post-operative colorectal cancer is well established. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been clinically used in colorectal cancer imaging including preoperative staging, evaluation of therapeutic response, detection of disease recurrence, and investigation of unexplained rising tumor markers. Case presentation: We report a case of resected colorectal cancer presented with rising CEA levels in 5 years, and FDG-PET revealed no definitive evidence of recurrence except abnormal focal FDG uptake in the right thyroid lobe. However, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid nodule showed negative for malignancy. Progressively rising CEA levels were noted over the following 5 years, but serial follow-up examinations did not find evidence of recurrence. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was performed subsequently and again showed focal FDG uptake in the right thyroid lobe. This time, FNAC revealed positive for malignancy, in favor of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and modified radical neck dissection, and MTC with cervical nodal metastasis (pT3N1) was diagnosed. He had cervical lymph nodes recurrence 2 years later, which was resected. Conclusions: This case reminded us that FDG-PET/CT may detect occult tumors resulting in CEA elevation other than colorectal cancer. Moreover, FNA has a higher false negative rate in detecting MTC than other forms of thyroid cancer. Repeat FNAC for the initial negative cytology result and measure of serum calcitonin for the early MTC detection could be more helpful to avoid the delay in MTC diagnosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Variations Improper activation and inappropriate expression of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) in cancer suggests that they can act as therapeutic targets. Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors are currently employed in clinical trials of different cancers. Regarding the essence and the importance of the personalized medicine, mainly mirrored by remarkable inter-individual variations in different populations, we aimed to perform a pilot study to address FGFR1 and FGFR3 expression levels and their correlation with the clinicopathological features in Iranian patients with bladder cancer (BC). Paired tumor and adjacent non tumor tissue samples along with their clinico-pathological parameters were obtained from 50 cases diagnosed with BC in different stages and grades. The mRNA expressions of FGFR1 and FGFR3 in tissue samples were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). The expression levels of FGFR3 were significantly higher in tumor tissues when compared to adjacent normal tissues (p = 0.007), regardless of the stages and grades of the tumor. Over expression was associated with cigarette smoking (p = 0.037) and family history for cancer (p = 0.004). Decreased expression of FGFR1 was observed, remarkably evident in high-grade tumors (p = 0.047), while over expression was detected in low-grade samples. This pilot study clearly suggests that in Iranian BC patients FGFR1 and FGFR3 expression patterns are different, and also highly distinctive with regard to the tumor's stage and grade. Such particular expression patterns may indicate their special values to be employed for interventional studies aiming targeted therapy. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to validate our results. © 2017 Ousati Ashtiani Z, Tavakkoly-Bazzaz J, Salami SA, Pourmand MR, Mansouri F, Mashahdi R, Pourmand G.",

    "Abstract": "The preference for computed tomography (CT) for the clinical assessment of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) infections has increased the concern about the potential risk of cancer in exposed patients. In this study, we investigated the correlation between cancer risk and radiation doses from different CT scanners, assuming an equivalent scan protocol. Radiation doses from three 16-slice units were estimated using the CT-Expo dosimetry software version 2.4 and standard CT scan protocol for patients with suspected PTB infections. The lifetime risk of cancer for each scanner was determined using the methodology outlined in the BEIR VII report. Organ doses were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the scanners. The calculated effective dose for scanner H2 is 34% and 37% higher than scanners H3 and H1 respectively. A high and statistically significant correlation was observed between estimated lifetime cancer risk for both male (r2 = 0.943, P < 0.05) and female patients (r2 = 0.989, P < 0.05). The risk variation between the scanners was slightly higher than 2% for all ages but was much smaller for specific ages for male and female patients (0.2% and 0.7%, respectively). These variations provide an indication that the use of a scanner optimizing protocol is imperative. © 2017 B. Adeleye and N. Chetty.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The purpose of this study was to determine prognostic factors influencing outcomes of surgical treatment in patients with T4a hypopharyngeal cancer. Methods: The present study enrolled 93 patients diagnosed with T4a hypopharyngeal cancer who underwent primary surgery between January 2005 and December 2015 at six medical centers in Korea. Primary tumor sites included pyriform sinus in 71 patients, posterior pharyngeal wall in 14 patients, and postcricoid region in 8 patients. Seventy-two patients received postoperative radio(chemo)therapy. Results: Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 38% and 45%, respectively. In univariate analysis, 5-year DFS was found to have significant and positive correlations with margin involvement (p < 0.001) and extracapsular spread (p = 0.025). Multivariate analysis confirmed that margin involvement (hazard ratio (HR): 2.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.49-5.30; p = 0.001) and extracapsular spread (HR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.08-3.99; p = 0.028) were significant factors associated with 5-year DFS. In univariate analysis, cervical lymph node metastasis (p = 0.048), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.041), extracapsular spread (p = 0.015), and esophageal invasion (p = 0.033) were significant factors associated with 5-year DSS. In multivariate analysis, extracapsular spread (HR: 2.98; 95% CI: 1.39-6.42; p = 0.005) and esophageal invasion (HR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.38-5.98; p = 0.005) remained significant factors associated with 5-year DSS. Conclusion: Margin involvement and extracapsular spread are factors influencing recurrence while extracapsular spread and esophageal invasion are factors affecting survival in patients with T4a hypopharyngeal cancer treated by primary surgery. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The conversion of the epithelial phenotype of cancer cells into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype-so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-has been shown to enhance the capacity of the cells to disseminate throughout the body. EMT is therefore becoming a potential target for anti-cancer drug discovery. Here, we showed that phoyunnanin E, a compound isolated from Dendrobium venustum, possesses anti-migration activity and addressed its mechanism of action. Methods: The cytotoxic and proliferative effects of phoyunnanin E on human non-small cell lung cancer-derived H460, H292, and A549 cells and human keratinocyte HaCaT cells were investigated by MTT assay. The effect of phoyunnanin E on EMT was evaluated by determining the colony formation and EMT markers. The migration and invasion of H460, H292, A549 and HaCaT cells was evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay, respectively. EMT markers, integrins and migration-associated proteins were examined by western blot analysis. Results: Phoyunnanin E at the concentrations of 5 and 10 μM, which are non-toxic to H460, H292, A549 and HaCaT cells showed good potential to inhibit the migratory activity of three types of human lung cancer cells. The anti-migration effect of phoyunnanin E was shown to relate to the suppressed EMT phenotypes, including growth in anchorage-independent condition, cell motility, and EMT-specific protein markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, slug, and snail). In addition to EMT suppression, we found that phoyunnanin E treatment with 5 and 10 μM could decrease the cellular level of integrin αv and integrin β3, these integrins are frequently up-regulated in highly metastatic tumor cells. We further characterized the regulatory proteins in cell migration and found that the cells treated with phoyunnanin E exhibited a significantly lower level of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) and phosphorylated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (p-AKT), and their downstream effectors (including Ras-related C3 botulinum (Rac-GTP); Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42); and Ras homolog gene family, member A (Rho-GTP)) in comparison to those of the non-treated control. Conclusions: We have determined for the first time that phoyunnanin E could inhibit the motility of lung cancer cells via the suppression of EMT and metastasis-related integrins. This new information could support further development of this compound for anti-metastasis approaches. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hypoxia-induced radioresistance constitutes a major obstacle for a curative treatment of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of photon and carbon ion irradiation in combination with inhibitors of DNA-Damage Response (DDR) on tumor cell radiosensitivity under hypoxic conditions. Methods: Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models, A549 and H1437, were irradiated with dose series of photon and carbon ions under hypoxia (1% O2) vs. normoxic conditions (21% O2). Clonogenic survival was studied after dual combinations of radiotherapy with inhibitors of DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNAPKi, M3814) and ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATMi). Results: The OER at 30% survival for photon irradiation of A549 cells was 1.4. The maximal oxygen effect measured as survival ratio was 2.34 at 8 Gy photon irradiation of A549 cells. In contrast, no significant oxygen effect was found after carbon ion irradiation. Accordingly, the relative effect of 6 Gy carbon ions was determined as 3.8 under normoxia and. 4.11 under hypoxia. ATM and DNA-PK inhibitors dose dependently sensitized tumor cells for both radiation qualities. For 100 nM DNAPKi the survival ratio at 4 Gy more than doubled from 1.59 under normoxia to 3.3 under hypoxia revealing a strong radiosensitizing effect under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, this ratio only moderately increased after photon irradiation and ATMi under hypoxia. The most effective treatment was combined carbon ion irradiation and DNA damage repair inhibition. Conclusions: Carbon ions efficiently eradicate hypoxic tumor cells. Both, ATMi and DNAPKi elicit radiosensitizing effects. DNAPKi preferentially sensitizes hypoxic cells to radiotherapy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to tumor recurrence and drug resistance. This study characterizes the tumorigenesis of CD133+ cells and their sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition. Methods: GSCs from human U87 and rat C6 glioblastoma cell lines were isolated via magnetic cell sorting using CD133 as a cancer stem cell marker. Cell proliferation was determined using the WST-1 assay. An intracranial mouse model and bioluminescence imaging were used to assess the effects of drugs on tumor growth in vivo. Results: CD133+ cells expressed stem cell markers and exhibited self-renewal and enhanced tumor formation. Minocycline (Mino) was more effective in reducing the survival rate of CD133+ cells, whereas CD133+ cells were more sensitive to inhibition by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor. Inhibition of STAT3 decreased the expression of CD133+ stem cell markers. The combination of Mino and STAT3 inhibitor synergistically reduced the cell viability of glioma cells. Furthermore, this combination synergistically suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Conclusion: The results suggest that concurrent targeting of different subpopulations of glioblastoma cells may be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with malignant glioma. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cachexia and anorexia are among the most frequent symptoms in patients with cancer. Cannabinoids have been used in patients with advanced cancer; however, their role is still controversial.METHODS: To answer this question we used Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, and generated a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified ten systematic reviews including three studies overall, of which two were randomized trials. We concluded it is not clear whether cannabinoids have any positive effect on increasing weight because the certainty of the evidence is very low. They might not have any effect on appetite, and are probably associated to frequent adverse effects.INTRODUCCIÓN: La caquexia y la anorexia se encuentran dentro de los síntomas más frecuentes en los pacientes oncológicos. Los cannabinoides han sido propuestos para su manejo en los pacientes con cáncer avanzado, sin embargo, su rol es controvertido.MÉTODOS: Para responder esta pregunta utilizamos Epistemonikos, la mayor base de datos de revisiones sistemáticas en salud a nivel mundial, la cual es mantenida mediante búsquedas en múltiples fuentes de información, incluyendo MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, entre otras. Extrajimos los datos desde las revisiones identificadas, reanalizamos los datos de los estudios primarios y preparamos una tabla de resumen de los resultados utilizando el método GRADE.RESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES: Identificamos diez revisiones sistemáticas, que en conjunto incluyen tres estudios, entre ellos dos ensayos aleatorizados. Concluimos que no está claro si los cannabinoides logran o no un aumento de peso en pacientes con anorexia-caquexia porque la certeza de la evidencia es muy baja, podrían no tener tampoco efecto sobre el apetito, y probablemente se asocian a efectos adversos frecuentes.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) develop in about 20-30% of breast cancer (BC) patients. BCBM are associated with dismal prognosis not at least due to lack of valuable molecular therapeutic targets. The aim of the study was to identify new molecular biomarkers and targets in BCBM by using complementary state-of-the-art techniques. Methods: We compared array expression profiles of three BCBM with 16 non-brain metastatic BC and 16 primary brain tumors (prBT) using a false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.05 and fold change (FC)>2. Biofunctional analysis was conducted on the differentially expressed probe sets. High-density arrays were employed to detect copy number variations (CNVs) and whole exome sequencing (WES) with paired-end reads of 150bp was utilized to detect gene mutations in the three BCBM. Results: The top 370 probe sets that were differentially expressed between BCBM and both BC and prBT were in the majority comparably overexpressed in BCBM and included, e.g. the coding genes BCL3, BNIP3, BNIP3P1, BRIP1, CASP14, CDC25A, DMBT1, IDH2, E2F1, MYCN, RAD51, RAD54L, and VDR. A number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were comparably overexpressed in BCBM and included SNORA1, SNORA2A, SNORA9, SNORA10, SNORA22, SNORA24, SNORA30, SNORA37, SNORA38, SNORA52, SNORA71A, SNORA71B, SNORA71C, SNORD13P2, SNORD15A, SNORD34, SNORD35A, SNORD41, SNORD53, and SCARNA22. The top canonical pathway was entitled, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response. Network analysis revealed key nodes as Akt, ERK1/2, NFkB, and Ras in a predicted activation stage. Downregulated genes in a data set that was shared between BCBM and prBT comprised, e.g. BC cell line invasion markers JUN, MMP3, TFF1, and HAS2. Important cancer genes affected by CNVs included TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, ERBB2, IDH1, and IDH2. WES detected numerous mutations, some of which affecting BC associated genes as CDH1, HEPACAM, and LOXHD1. Conclusions: Using complementary molecular genetic techniques, this study identified shared and unshared molecular events in three highly aberrant BCBM emphasizing the challenge to detect new molecular biomarkers and targets with translational implications. Among new findings with the capacity to gain clinical relevance is the detection of overexpressed snoRNAs known to regulate some critical cellular functions as ribosome biogenesis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Extraneural metastases are rarely reported in the literature. Case presentation: We report a case of a 38-year-old patient who was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2015. Four months after surgery, local relapse was found and the patient received a second surgery. After another 4 months, we found a hard mass in the right posterior neck when she admitted to our department for fourth cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. Immunohistochemical investigation supported the diagnosis of glioblastoma metastases to the neck after resection of the right neck mass. A few days later, spinal vertebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed multiple metastases in the thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and bilateral iliac bones. Conclusions: Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Whole tumor resection and early radiotherapy and chemotherapy can delay recurrence and prolong survival. Extracranial metastases are extremely rare. We report this case with the aim of bringing attention to extracranial metastasis of brain glioma. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to use texture analysis (TA) of breast magnetic resonance (MR) images to assist in differentiating estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer molecular subtypes. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with histopathologically proven invasive ductal breast cancer were selected in preliminary study. Tumors were classified into molecular subtypes: luminal A (ER-positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) -negative, proliferation marker Ki-67<20 and low grade (I)) and luminal B (ER-positive and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or HER2-negative with high Ki-67≥20 and higher grade (II or III)). Co-occurrence matrix -based texture features were extracted from each tumor on T1-weighted non fat saturated pre- and postcontrast MR images using TA software MaZda. Texture parameters and tumour volumes were correlated with tumour prognostic factors. Results: Textural differences were observed mainly in precontrast images. The two most discriminative texture parameters to differentiate luminal A and luminal B subtypes were sum entropy and sum variance (p=0.003). The AUCs were 0.828 for sum entropy (p=0.004), and 0.833 for sum variance (p=0.003), and 0.878 for the model combining texture features sum entropy, sum variance (p=0.001). In the LOOCV, the AUC for model combining features sum entropy and sum variance was 0.876. Sum entropy and sum variance showed positive correlation with higher Ki-67 index. Luminal B types were larger in volume and moderate correlation between larger tumour volume and higher Ki-67 index was also observed (r=0.499, p=0.008). Conclusions: Texture features which measure randomness, heterogeneity or smoothness and homogeneity may either directly or indirectly reflect underlying growth patterns of breast tumours. TA and volumetric analysis may provide a way to evaluate the biologic aggressiveness of breast tumours and provide aid in decisions regarding therapeutic efficacy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The transcription factor TWIST1 plays an important role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and in the migration, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. OCT4, which is a homeobox transcription factor, has an important role in the self-renewal potential of cancer cells. Our aim here is to elucidate impact of ectopic expression of TWIST1 on OCT4 gene expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: The ESCC line was KYSE30. GP293T cells were transfected with purf-IRES-GFP and pGP plasmids to produce recombinant viral particles. A semi-confluent KYSE30 culture was transduced with the prepared retroviral particles. mRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed from normal KYSE30 cells and those ectopically expressing TWIST1. Expressional analysis of TWIST1 and OCT4 were performed with relative comparative real-time PCR. Results: Ectopic expression of TWIST1 in KYSE30 cells was related to its significant overexpression: nearly nine-fold higher in GFP-hTWIST1 KYSE-30 cells than in control GFP cells. This induced expression of TWIST1 caused significant upregulation of OCT4 in GFP-hTWIST1 KYSE-30 cells: nearly eight-fold higher. In silico analysis predicted the correlation of TWIST1 and OCT4 through ETS2. Conclusions: Overexpressed TWIST1 can be correlated with upregulation of the cancer stem cell marker OCT4 and the protein may play critical regulatory role in OCT4 gene expression. Since OCT4 is involved in the self-renewal process, the results may suggest a new linkage between TWIST1 and OCT4 in the cell biology of ESCC, highlighting the probable role of TWIST1 in inducing self-renewal. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The nucleolus is an organelle that is an ultrastructural element of the cell nucleus observed in H&E staining as a roundish body stained with eosin due to its high protein content. Changes in the nucleoli cytomorphology were one of the first histopathological characteristics of malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the cytomorphological characteristics of nucleoli and detailed clinicopathological parameters of melanoma patients. Moreover, we analyzed the correlation between cytomorphological parameters of nucleoli and immunoreactivity of selected proteins responsible for, among others, regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (SPARC, N-cadherin), cell adhesion and motility (ALCAM, ADAM-10), mitotic divisions (PLK1), cellular survival (FOXP1) and the functioning of Golgi apparatus (GOLPH3, GP73). Methods: Three characteristics of nucleoli - presence, size and number - of cancer cells were assessed in H&E-stained slides of 96 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary cutaneous melanoma tissue specimens. The results were correlated with classical clinicopathological features and patient survival. Immunohistochemical analysis of the above mentioned proteins was described in details in previous studies. Results: Higher prevalence and size of nucleoli were associated with thicker and mitogenic tumors. All three nucleolar characteristics were related to the presence of ulceration. Moreover, microsatellitosis was strongly correlated with the presence of macronucleoli and polynucleolization (presence of two or more nucleoli). Lack of immunologic response manifested as no TILs in primary tumor was associated with high prevalence of melanoma cells with distinct nucleoli. Interestingly, in nodular melanoma a higher percentage of melanoma cells with prominent nucleoli was observed. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, increased prevalence and amount, but not size of nucleoli, were connected with shorter cancer-specific and disease-free survival. Conclusion: (1) High representation of cancer cells with distinct nucleoli, greater size and number of nucleoli per cell are characteristics of aggressive phenotype of melanoma; (2) higher prevalence and size of nucleoli are potential measures of cell kinetics that are strictly correlated with high mitotic rate; and (3) high prevalence of cancer cells with distinct nucleoli and presence of melanocytes with multiple nucleoli are features associated with unfavorable prognosis in patients with cutaneous melanoma. © 2017 The Author(s).",

However, the removal of the lesion is critical for further treatment and survival of the patients 22 patients with pineal area tumors were surgically treated via keyhole medial suboccipital craniotomy and supracerebellar midline approach All the patients were operated in the sitting position with the use of operating microscope and microsurgical technique. All patients survived surgery in a perfect condition, and no one patient worsened after surgery. No complications due to the sitting position were noted. Surgical removal of pineal area tumors via small suboccipital craniotomy is safe and with the use of microsurgical techniques the results of surgical treatment are excellent. The sitting position of the patients gives a better view to the surgeon. We did not observe any intraoperational complications due to the sitting position. © 2017 Zbigniew Kotwica et al.",

    "Abstract": "A novel antisense transcript was identified in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter region, suggesting that the hTERT promoter is bidirectional. This transcript, named hTERT antisense promoter-associated (hTAPAS) RNA, is a 1.6 kb long non-coding RNA. hTAPAS transcription is initiated 167 nucleotides upstream of the hTERT transcription start site and is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, we observed that a large fraction of the hTERT polyadenylated RNA is localized in the nucleus, suggesting this might be an additional means of regulating the cellular abundance of hTERT protein. Both hTAPAS and hTERT are expressed in immortalized B-cells and human embryonic stem cells but are not detected in normal somatic cells. hTAPAS expression inversely correlates with hTERT expression in different types of cancer samples. Moreover, hTAPAS expression is not promoted by an hTERT promoter mutation (-124 C > T). Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated knockdown of hTAPAS results in an increase in hTERT expression. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of hTAPAS down regulates hTERT expression, suggesting a negative role in hTERT gene regulation. These observations provide insights into hTAPAS as a novel player that negatively regulates hTERT expression and may be involved in telomere length homeostasis. © 2016 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor autoantibodies are becoming an increasingly recognized contributor to the spectrum of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. They are classically associated with seizures and behavioral disturbance, and may coexist with other autoantibodies. Many are paraneoplastic, most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer. Until now there have been no reports of cardiac dysrhythmias in these patients. Case presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian man presented with multiple seizures, dysarthria and behavioral disturbance of unclear etiology, with associated asystolic cardiac arrest. Antibody testing showed anti-Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor and anti-Hu antibodies in serum and Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor autoantibodies in cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnosis of small cell lung cancer was subsequently made after lung biopsy, and the patient showed improvement with chemotherapy and intravenous immunoglobulin. Conclusions: We present the case of a patient with Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor limbic encephalitis associated with asystolic cardiac arrest, an association not previously described. This case illustrates how difficult it is to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds alone. We therefore propose more routine antibody testing in patients with similar symptomatology who remain undifferentiated after initial workup. We also recommend that in the acute setting, patients with Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor encephalitis should receive cardiac monitoring, as further research is required to clarify its possible link with cardiac dysrhythmias. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Immunologic factors can promote the progression of oral squamous cell carcinomas (oscc). The phylogenetic highly conserved protein Galectin 3 (Gal3) contributes to cell differentiation and immune homeostasis. There is evidence that Gal3 is involved in the progression of oscc and influences the regulation of macrophage polarization. Macrophage polarization (M1 vs. M2) in solid malignancies like oscc contributes to tumor immune-escape. However, the relationship between macrophage polarization and Gal3 expression in oscc is not yet understood. The current study analyzes the association between histomorphologic parameters (T-, N-, L- Pn-status, grading) and Gal3 expression resp. the ratio between Gal3 expressing cells and CD68 positive macrophages in oscc specimens. Methods: Preoperative diagnostic biopsies (n = 26) and tumor resection specimens (n = 34) of T1/T2 oscc patients were immunohistochemically analyzed for Gal3 and CD68 expression. The number of Gal3 expressing cells and the ratio between CD68 and Gal3 expressing cells was quantitatively assessed. Results: In biopsy and tumor resection specimens, the number of Gal3 positive cells as well as the Gal3/CD68 ratio were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in T2 oscc compared to T1 cases. In biopsy specimens, a significantly (p < 0.05) increased Gal3 expression and Gal3/CD68 ratio was associated with the progression marker lymph vessel infiltration (L1). Tumor resection specimens of cases with lymph node metastases (N+) had a significantly (p < 0.05) increased Gal3 expression. Additionally, a high Gal3/CD68 ratio correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with higher grading (G3) in tumor resection specimens. Conclusion: High Gal3 expression in oscc is associated with tumor size (T-status) and parameters of malignancy (N-, L-status, grading). Gal3 might contribute to M2 macrophage mediated local immune tolerance. Gal3 expression shows association with prognosis in oscc and represent a potential therapeutic target. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Since their discovery by Iijima in 1991 [1], carbon nanotubes have sparked unwavering interest among researchers all over the world. This is due to the unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Carbon nanotubes have excellent mechanical and electrical properties with high chemical and thermal stability. In addition, carbon nanotubes have a very large surface area and are hollow inside. This gives a very broad spectrum of nanotube applications, such as in combination with polymers as polymer composites in the automotive, aerospace or textile industries. At present, many methods of nanotube synthesis are known [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. It is also possible to use carbon nanotubes in biomedical applications [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], including the destruction of cancer cells using iron-filled carbon nanotubes in the hyperthermia process. Computer modelling results of Fe-CNTs induction heating process are presented in the paper. As an object used for computer model creation, Fe-CNTs were synthesized by the authors using CCVD technique. © 2017 S. Wiak et al. 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In our previous study, we revealed that MEG3 was a tumor suppressor gene in retinoblastoma and inhibited proliferation of retinoblastoma cells by regulating the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Here, we further explored the mechanism of MEG3 inactivation in retinoblastoma. Methods: MSP and qRT-PCR were performed to detect the methylation status of MEG3 promoter and levels of MEG3 expression, respective. To further explore relationship between MEG3 expression and epigenetic modifications, 5-Aza-CdR was used to interfere with DNA methylation. In addition, we evaluated proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of β-catenin via CCK-8, flow cytometric analysis and western blot analysis, respective. Results: Hypermethylation of MEG3 promoter was observed more frequently in retinoblastoma tissues and was highly associated with low MEG3 expression and poor survival of retinoblastoma patients. We also provided evidence demonstrating that hypermethylation of MEG3 promoter depressed MEG3 expression, promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and increased β-catenin expression of retinoblastoma cells in vitro. Conclusions: Our present study indicates that promoter silencing by hypermethylation may account for the loss of MEG3 expression and predict poor prognosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The recommended chemotherapy for drug-sensitive tuberculosis (TB) consists of four different antibiotics administrated for 6 months. This long treatment leads to significant compliance problems and consequently to recrudescence of the disease and to the development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Thus, new alternatives are needed to shorten or simplify the treatment of TB. Antibodies have therapeutic effects in animal models of TB, so their use as adjuvants in drug-sensitive and MDR TB is an interesting alternative. To assess the effect of antibodies, BALB/c mice with active late disease 60 days after infection with drug-sensitive TB strain H37Rv were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy. When compared with control non-treated animals, IVIg alone produced a significantly decreased burden of pulmonary bacilli. This decrease was even greater when IVIg was used in combination with conventional chemotherapy. The combined therapy also significantly reduced tissue damage (pneumonia) when compared to infected animals treated only with antibiotics. IVIg treatment also caused decreased bacillary burdens in mice infected with an MDR strain. In vitro experiments suggested that improving phagocytosis by efficient opsonization is perhaps the principal mechanism of this beneficial therapeutic effect. © FEMS 2017. All rights reserved.

    "Abstract": "Background: Amyloid A amyloidosis is one of the most common forms of amyloidosis. It is secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, which is difficult to manage and has a poor prognosis. We present a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and amyloid A amyloidosis who was treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6 receptor, resulting in improvement in both proteinuria and gastrointestinal symptoms; however, amyloid deposition remained. Case presentation: A 67-year-old woman who had previously been treated for rheumatoid arthritis presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Right renal cell carcinoma was found, and amyloid A amyloidosis was diagnosed concomitantly based on colon biopsy. The renal cell carcinoma was resected, and the non-cancerous part of the renal tissue also showed amyloid A deposition. Following surgery, protein levels in the urine increased to the nephrotic range, and administration of tocilizumab was initiated, which resulted in resolution of the proteinuria. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms were also alleviated. However, repeat colon biopsy showed amyloid deposition. Conclusions: This case of amyloid A amyloidosis suggests that amyloid deposition indicates only structural change of the affected tissue, and that it is not amyloid deposition per se that causes the clinical symptoms of amyloidosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Even though internal fixation has expanded the indications for cervical spine surgery, it carries the risks of fracture or migration, with associated potential life threatening complications. Removal of metal work from the cervical spine is required in case of failure of internal fixation, but it can become challenging, especially when a great amount of scar tissue is present because of previous surgery and radiotherapy. Case presentation: We report a 16 year old competitive basketball athlete who underwent a combined anterior and posterior approach for resection of an osteosarcoma of the sixth cervical vertebra. Fourteen years after the index procedure, the patient eliminated spontaneously one screw through the intestinal tract via an oesophageal perforation and developed a severe dysphagia. Three revision surgeries were performed to remove the anterior plate because of the great amount of post-surgery and post-irradiation fibrosis. Conclusions: Screw migration and oesophageal perforation after cervical spine surgery are uncommon potentially life-threatening occurrences. Revision surgery may be challenging and it requires special skills. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Increased reactive oxygen species causes cells or tissue damages and is associated with some degenerative diseases, such as coronary heart diseases and cancer. This research is intended to isolate and to identify the antiradical compounds from the bark of Jujube tree (Zizyphus mauritiana Auct. non Lamk.). The methanol extract of the bark was successively fractionated with n-hexane and ethyl acetate to give n-hexane fraction, ethyl acetate fraction, and methanol extract residue, respectively. The extract and fractions were examined for its radical scavenging activity using 2,2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil radical. The ethyl acetate fraction, having the most active 2,2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil radical scavenging, was further repeatedly separated using vacuum liquid chromatography, and the purification was carried out using preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) in order to obtain an active isolate. The purity of the isolate was evaluated using thin layer chromatography method and melting point measurement. The structure of the isolate was identified chemically using various spray reagent and ultraviolet-visible, infrared, infrared, Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Proton Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopic methods. The extract, fraction, and sub-fractions were determined for its total contents of phenolic and flavonoid. The results showed that the methanol extract residue contained the highest total phenolic (36.29% wt/wt gallic acid equivalent), while fraction E4 of the ethyl acetate extract contained the highest total flavonoids (21.31% wt/wt quercetin equivalent). The active isolate showed to have 2,2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil radical scavenging activity with IC50 of 7.58 μ/mL and is identified as trans-p-coumaroyl triterpene. Detail structure of the triterpene needs to be identified further. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Different confounder adjustment strategies were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) in case-control study, i.e. how many confounders original studies adjusted and what the variables are. This secondary data analysis is aimed to detect whether there are potential biases caused by difference of confounding factor adjustment strategies in case-control study, and whether such bias would impact the summary effect size of meta-analysis. Methods: We included all meta-analyses that focused on the association between breast cancer and passive smoking among non-smoking women, as well as each original case-control studies included in these meta-analyses. The relative deviations (RDs) of each original study were calculated to detect how magnitude the adjustment would impact the estimation of ORs, compared with crude ORs. At the same time, a scatter diagram was sketched to describe the distribution of adjusted ORs with different number of adjusted confounders. Results: Substantial inconsistency existed in meta-analysis of case-control studies, which would influence the precision of the summary effect size. First, mixed unadjusted and adjusted ORs were used to combine individual OR in majority of meta-analysis. Second, original studies with different adjustment strategies of confounders were combined, i.e. the number of adjusted confounders and different factors being adjusted in each original study. Third, adjustment did not make the effect size of original studies trend to constringency, which suggested that model fitting might have failed to correct the systematic error caused by confounding. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of confounder adjustment strategies in case-control studies may lead to further bias for summary effect size in meta-analyses, especially for weak or medium associations so that the direction of causal inference would be even reversed. Therefore, further methodological researches are needed, referring to the assessment of confounder adjustment strategies, as well as how to take this kind of bias into consideration when drawing conclusion based on summary estimation of meta-analyses. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) plays an important role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of RPE cells. We investigated the effects of a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, on the EMT in RPE cells. In addition, we assessed the influence of bortezomib on regulation of the NF-κB pathway during this process. Methods: After treatment with various concentrations of bortezomib, cell viability was analyzed with the water-soluble tetrazolium salt-8 assay, cell-cycle regulation was evaluated with flow cytometry, and cell migration was monitored with in vitro wound healing and Transwell migration assays. To induce fibroblastoid transformation, the RPE cells were treated with recombinant human transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (10 ng/ml), and western blot and immunocytochemical analyses were performed to evaluate altered expression of EMT markers after treatment with bortezomib. To verify the effect of bortezomib on shrinkage by myofibroblastic transformation, a contraction assay of the RPE-collagen gel lattice was performed. Results: Treatment with bortezomib decreased RPE viability in a dose-dependent manner, and flow cytometry revealed that these effects were due to arrest of the G2/M phase cell-cycle. In the in vitro wound healing and Transwell migration assays, treatment with 20 nM bortezomib significantly impeded RPE migration. Treatment with bortezomib also significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced transdifferentiation of the RPE cells. The effects on proliferation, migration, and the EMT were mediated by regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, bortezomib inhibited contraction of the RPE-collagen gel lattices. Conclusions: Bortezomib inhibits myofibroblastic transformation of RPE cells by downregulating NF-κB expression and prevents contraction of the RPE-collagen gel matrix. Thus, bortezomib represents a candidate putative therapeutic agent for management of retinal fibrotic diseases. © 2017 Molecular Vision.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are an anti-neoplastic treatment modality delivered via application of alternating electric fields using insulated transducer arrays placed directly on the skin in the region surrounding the tumor. A Phase 3 clinical trial has demonstrated the effectiveness of continuous TTFields application in patients with glioblastoma during maintenance treatment with Temozolomide. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combining TTFields with radiation treatment (RT) in glioma cells. We also examined the effect of TTFields transducer arrays on RT distribution in a phantom model and the impact on rat skin toxicity. Methods: The efficacy of TTFields application after induction of DNA damage by RT or bleomycin was tested in U-118 MG and LN-18 glioma cells. The alkaline comet assay was used to measure repair of DNA lesions. Repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were assessed by analyzing γH2AX or Rad51 foci. DNA damage and repair signaled by the activation pattern of phospho-ATM (pS1981) and phospho-DNA-PKcs (pS2056) was evaluated by immunoblotting. The absorption of the RT energy by transducer arrays was measured by applying RT through arrays placed on a solid-state phantom. Skin toxicities were tested in rats irradiated daily through the arrays with 2Gy (total dose of 20Gy). Results: TTFields synergistically enhanced the efficacy of RT in glioma cells. Application of TTFields to irradiated cells impaired repair of irradiation- or chemically-induced DNA damage, possibly by blocking homologous recombination repair. Transducer arrays presence caused a minor reduction in RT intensity at 20 mm and 60 mm below the arrays, but led to a significant increase in RT dosage at the phantom surface jeopardizing the \"skin sparing effect\". Nevertheless, transducer arrays placed on the rat skin during RT did not lead to additional skin reactions. Conclusions: Administration of TTFields after RT increases glioma cells treatment efficacy possibly by inhibition of DNA damage repair. These preclinical results support the application of TTFields therapy immediately after RT as a viable regimen to enhance RT outcome. Phantom measurements and animal models imply that it may be possible to leave the transducer arrays in place during RT without increasing skin toxicities. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Use of dietary supplements among cancer survivors is common and controversial, but information on the amount of nutrients from supplements among cancer survivors is limited. We examined the amount of nutrients and their contribution to total nutrient intake from supplements and compared these data between cancer survivors and cancer-free individuals. We also identified factors associated with supplement use among cancer survivors. Methods: We identified 400 cancer survivors and 10,387 cancer-free individuals, aged ≥ 19 years, from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) V-1, 2 (2010, 2011). We calculated the amount of nutrients consumed from foods and supplements, the percent contributions of supplement nutrients to total nutrient intakes and cancer survivors' nutrient intakes relative to the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs). We examined factors associated with supplement use among cancer survivors. Results: We found that 33.3% of cancer survivors and 22.1% of cancer-free individuals reported the use of dietary supplements. Compared to cancer-free individuals, cancer survivors had higher intakes of riboflavin, folate, and iron from foods (p < 0.05 for each), and higher intakes of calcium (p = 0.05) and vitamin C (p = 0.01) from foods and supplements. The similar pattern was observed for the percent contributions to total nutrient intake. Cancer survivors had higher proportion of participants below EARs than cancer-free individuals for thiamin and niacin (p < 0.05 for each). The proportions of cancer survivors below the EARs were 61.2% for calcium, 49.1% for riboflavin, and 43.5% for folate and the proportions of cancer survivors above the ULs were 3.3% for iron, and 2.3% for vitamin A. For female cancer survivors, education above an elementary school level, moderate physical activity, low vegetable intake, and high circulating vitamin D levels were associated with supplement use. For male cancer survivors, living in an urban area, no consumption of alcohol, and lower energy intake, were associated with supplement use. Conclusions: Korean cancer survivors have higher rate of dietary supplement use and higher contribution from supplements to total nutrient intake than cancer-free individuals. Demographic and lifestyle factors were associated with supplement use among cancer survivors. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: In Denmark, national roll-out of a population-based, screening mammography program took place in 2007-2010. We report on outcome of the first four biennial invitation rounds. Methods: Data on screening outcome were retrieved from the 2015 and 2016 national screening quality reports. We calculated coverage by examination; participation after invitation; detection-, interval cancer- and false-positive rates; cancer characteristics; sensitivity and specificity, for Denmark and for the five regions. Results: At the national level coverage by examination remained at 75-77%; lower in the Capital Region than in the rest of Denmrk. Detection rate was slightly below 1% at first screen, 0.6% at subsequent screens, and one region had some fluctuation over time. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) constituted 13-14% of screen-detected cancers. In subsequent rounds, 80% of screen-detected invasive cancers were node negative and 40% ≤10 mm. False-positive rate was around 2%; higher for North Denmark Region than for the rest of Denmark. Three out of 10 breast cancers in screened women were diagnosed as interval cancers. Conclusions: High coverage by examination and low interval cancer rate are required for screening to decrease breast cancer mortality. Two pioneer local screening programs starting in the 1990s were followed by a decrease in breast cancer mortality of 22-25%. Coverage by examination and interval cancer rate of the national program were on the favorable side of values from the pioneer programs. It appears that the implementation of a national screening program in Denmark has been successful, though regional variations need further evaluation to assure optimization of the program. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and predicts a poor prognosis. Previously, we found that HECTD3 confers cancer cell resistance to apoptosis. However, the significance of HECTD3 expression in ovarian cancer and its regulatory mechanisms were unknown. Here, we found that HECTD3 depletion promotes carboplatin-induced apoptosis in both an ovarian cancer cell model and a xenograft mouse model. Moreover, high HECTD3 expression is significantly associated with poor platinum response and prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. We further demonstrated that HER2 can up-regulate HECTD3 expression through activating STAT3. Furthermore, HER2 inhibitors, such as lapatinib, down-regulate HECTD3 expression and thus promote the chemosensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin. Lapatinib combined with carboplatin also significantly inhibits serous ovarian carcinoma growth compared with each drug alone in a xenograft mouse model. HECTD3 may be considered a promising molecular predictor of platinum chemosensitivity and prognosis for serous ovarian cancer. Through decreasing HECTD3, lapatinib possesses significantly increased anti-tumor activity when combined with carboplatin compared with each agent alone, which provides an optional therapeutic regimen for serous ovarian cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical epidemiological characteristics and the dynamic distribution of pathology types of patients with primary lung cancer in Peking University Cancer Hospital from 2000 to 2013,so as to preliminarily identify the epidemic trend of the patients with lung cancer surgery and provide scientific basis for the prevention and control of lung cancer. METHODS Clinical data of patients with lung cancer who underwent surgical treatment in the hospital between 2000 and 2013 was retrospectively collected. The sex,age of onset and pathology type distribution of the patients were analyzed statistically. RESULTS A total of 3 733 patients with lung cancer met the inclusion criteria.The number of lung cancer patients admitted for treatment in the 14 years showed an increasing trend (P=0.018). The proportion of male and female was 1.52:1,and the proportion of female patients showed an uptrend (P&lt;0.001). Age of onset was concentrated in two age groups as 60-74 group (45.69%) and 45-59 (42.13%) group. The first three pathology types were adenocarcinoma (63.41%),squamous cell carcinoma (24.48%) and small cell lung cancer (3.08%). Trend χ 2 test showed that with the increase of the year,the proportion of squamous cell carcinoma showed a downtrend while the proportion of adenocarcinoma showed an uptrend (all P&lt;0.001),the proportion of the male patient with squamous cell carcinoma showed uptrend (P=0.005) while the proportion of female patient with adenocarcinoma showed uptrend (P&lt;0.001). The pathology type distribution of male and female patients was different (P&lt;0.001). The majority of male patients were adenocarcinoma (49.73%) and squamous cell carcinoma (35.92%),and adenocarcinoma was 84.20% in female patients,and squamous carcinoma accountted for only 7.09%.Compared finding in the former 7 years and that in the latter 7 years,the constitution of pathology type in male patients did not change (P=0.115),whereas that in female patients changed (P&lt;0.001),the manifestation was the proportion of adenocarcinoma rose from 74.43% in the former 7 years to 85.90% in the latter 7 years while the proportion of squamous cell carcinoma decreased from 15.07% to 5.71%. Lung cancer occurred predominantly in the upper lobe of the lung (50.74%) and the lower lobe (31.48%). CONCULSIONS In the past 14 years,the proportion of female patients with lung cancer surgery had increased significantly,the proportion of squamous cell carcinoma had decreased while the proportion of adenocarcinoma increased,and the increase of adenocarcinoma was mainly due to the increase of female patients with adenocarcinoma. We must strengthen health education,popularize knowledge of lung cancer prevention and control,set up awareness of regular physical examination,so as to improve the early diagnosis rate of lung cancer. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Background: Patients with gastric cancer commonly have a poor prognosis, owing to its invasiveness and distant metastasis. Recent studies have confirmed the pivotal role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis and the progression of malignant tumors, including gastric cancer. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which lncRNA AK023391 contributes to gastric cancer. Methods: A lncRNA microarray was used to identify the differentially expressed lncRNA AK023391 in gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues. In addition, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to investigate the association between AK023391 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Subsequently, a series of in vitro assays and a xenograft tumor model were used to observe the functions of lncRNA AK023391 in gastric cancer cells. A cancer pathway microarray, bioinformatic analysis, western blotting, and immunochemistry were carried out to verify the regulation of AK023391 and its downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Results: Expression of lncRNA AK023391 was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer samples and cell lines in comparison to adjacent normal tissues, and was positively correlated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer. The multivariate Cox regression model revealed that AK023391 expression acted as an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with gastric cancer. Knockdown of AK023391 inhibited cell growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells, whereas its overexpression reversed these effects. Mechanistically, PI3K/Akt signaling mediated the NF-κB, FOXO3a, and p53 pathways. Moreover, downstream transcription factors, such as c-myb, cyclinB1/G2, and BCL-6 might be involved in AK023391-induced tumorigenesis in gastric cancer. Conclusions: The novel oncogenic lncRNA AK023391 in gastric cancer exerts its effects through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and may act as a potential biomarker for survival in patients with gastric cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The search for new cancer biomarkers is essential for fundamental research, diagnostics, as well as for patient treatment and monitoring. Whereas most cancer biomarkers are biomolecules, an increasing number of studies show that mechanical cues are promising biomarker candidates. Although cell deformability has been shown to be a possible cancer biomarker, cellular forces as cancer biomarkers have been left largely unexplored. Here, we measure traction forces of cancer and normal-like cells at high spatial resolution using a robust method based on dense vertical arrays of nanowires. A force map is created using automated image analysis based on the localization of the fluorescent tips of the nanowires. We show that the force distribution and magnitude differ between MCF7 breast cancer cells and MCF10A normal-like breast epithelial cells, and that monitoring traction forces can be used to investigate the effects of anticancer drugs. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The tumor immune environment not only modulates the effects of immunotherapy, but also the effects of other anticancer drugs and treatment outcomes. These immune responses can be evaluated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which has frequently been verified clinically. On the other hand, residual cancer burden (RCB) evaluation has been shown to be a useful predictor of survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In this study, RCB and TILs evaluations were combined to produce an indicator that we have termed \"RCB-TILs\", and its clinical application to NAC for breast cancer was verified by subtype-stratified analysis. Methods: A total of 177 patients with breast cancer were treated with NAC. The correlation between RCB and TILs evaluated according to the standard method, and prognosis, including the efficacy of NAC, was investigated retrospectively. The RCB and TILs evaluations were combined to create the \"RCB-TILs\". Patients who were RCB-positive and had high TILs were considered RCB-TILs-positive, and all other combinations were RCB-TILs-negative. Results: On multivariable analysis, being RCB-TILs-positive was an independent factor for recurrence after NAC in all patients (p < 0.001, hazard ratio = 0.048), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (p = 0.018, hazard ratio = 0.041), HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2BC) patients (p = 0.036, hazard ratio = 0.134), and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HRBC) patients (p = 0.002, hazard ratio = 0.081). Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that RCB-TILs is a significant predictor for breast cancer recurrence after NAC and may be a more sensitive indicator than TILs alone. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE The incidence of pulmonary function damage and pulmonary infection after esophageal cancer surgery is high. In this study,heated and humidified high flow nasal cannulaventilate(HHFNC) is used to these patients after esophageal cancer surgery to study the results of airway humidification and oxygen therapy. METHODS Seventy patients with esophageal cancer who underwent ICU in Shandong Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University from November 2016-11-1 to 2017-05-31 were divided into control group (n=35) and observation group (n=35) according to random number table. Patients in the observation group were treated with HHFNC,while patients in the control group were treated with common oxygenated moisturizing oxygen bottles. Arterial blood gas analysis results before and 12 and 24 hours after treatment were compared between the two groups. RESULTS After 12 and 24 hours of treatment,the levels of PaO 2 in the observation group were (83.77±8.28) and (90.00±6.34) and in the control group (84.85±10.40) and (77.40±6.23),respectively,with a significant difference of F=138.88 and P&lt;0.01; The SaO 2 observation group was (94.74±1.78) and (96.20±1.18),the control group was (93.14±2.51) and (94.28±2.08),the difference was statistically significant,F=85.93,P&lt;0.01. Totally 31 cases (88.57%) were satisfied with humidification in observation group,which was significantly better than that in control group (34.29%),χ 2 =19.53,P&lt;0.05. CONCLUSION The use of HHFNC is beneficial to the dilution of airway secretions in postoperative esophageal cancer patients and significantly improves the effect of oxygen therapy. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. women and the deadliest gynecologic malignancy. This lethality is largely due to the fact that most cases are diagnosed at metastatic stages of the disease when the prognosis is poor. Epidemiologic studies consistently demonstrate that parous women have a reduced risk of developing ovarian cancer, with a greater number of births affording greater protection; however little is known about the impact of parity on ovarian cancer metastasis. Here we report that multiparous mice are less susceptible to ovarian cancer metastasis in an age-matched syngeneic murine allograft model. Interferon pathways were found to be upregulated in healthy adipose tissue of multiparous mice, suggesting a possible mechanism for the multiparous-related protective effect against metastasis. This protective effect was found to be lost with age. Based on this work, future studies exploring therapeutic strategies which harness the multiparity-associated protective effect demonstrated here are warranted. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer constitutes a momentous health burden in our society. Critical information on cancer may be hidden in its signaling pathways. However, even though a large amount of money has been spent on cancer research, some critical information on cancer-related signaling pathways still remains elusive. Hence, new works towards a complete understanding of cancer-related signaling pathways will greatly benefit the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Results: We propose the node-weighted Steiner tree approach to identify important elements of cancer-related signaling pathways at the level of proteins. This new approach has advantages over previous approaches since it is fast in processing large protein-protein interaction networks. We apply this new approach to identify important elements of two well-known cancer-related signaling pathways: PI3K/Akt and MAPK. First, we generate a node-weighted protein-protein interaction network using protein and signaling pathway data. Second, we modify and use two preprocessing techniques and a state-of-the-art Steiner tree algorithm to identify a subnetwork in the generated network. Third, we propose two new metrics to select important elements from this subnetwork. On a commonly used personal computer, this new approach takes less than 2 s to identify the important elements of PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways in a large node-weighted protein-protein interaction network with 16,843 vertices and 1,736,922 edges. We further analyze and demonstrate the significance of these identified elements to cancer signal transduction by exploring previously reported experimental evidences. Conclusions: Our node-weighted Steiner tree approach is shown to be both fast and effective to identify important elements of cancer-related signaling pathways. Furthermore, it may provide new perspectives into the identification of signaling pathways for other human diseases. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE The most common metastatic sites of advanced non-small cell lung cancer include the bone,brain,adrenal gland,and liver. The clinical characteristics of different metastatic sites are different,and the prognosis is different. Subcutaneous soft tissue metastasis is a rare metastasis type of lung cancer. This study is to investigate the clinical features,pathological types and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases. METHODS Data of patients with NSCLC were collected from the Peking University Cancer Hospital from September 2009 to June 2016,and then the patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastasis were enrolled. It was a retrospective analysis of 45 cases of NSCLC patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases. The clinical and pathological features of those patients were summarized. According to the follow-up data,understand the treatment outcome and survival prognosis,and further analysis of prognostic factors. RESULTS The median age of non-small cell lung cancer patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases was 59 years. There were 30 males(66.7%) and 15 females(33.3%). Primary lung cancer and subcutaneous soft tissue metastases were found at the same time in 27 cases(60.0%),and there were 18 cases(40.0%) in which the metastases were found afterward. Only isolated soft tissue metastases were in 7 cases(15.6%),and 38 cases(84.4%) with other distant metastases,including 33 cases with bone metastases.Pathological types were: adenocarcinoma in 30 cases(66.7%),squamous cell carcinoma in 14 cases(31.1%),adeno-squamous cell carcinoma in 1 cases(2.2%). Of the 26 patients with EGFR gene testing,7 were EGFR mutations (26.9%) and 19 were EGFR wild-type(73.1%). The survival time of the 45 patients ranged from 0.5 months to 40 months,with a median OS of 4.0 months. Median survival time of non-small cell lung cancer patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases was 4.0 months by Kaplan-Meier calculation. The prognosis of patients with stable first-line treatment was better. CONCLUSIONS NSCLC patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases suggest poor prognosis. The effectiveness of first-line treatment may be an independent factor that affects patients' prognosis. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE To explore the expression of (NF-E2)-related factor 2(Nrf2) in benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH) and prostate cancer(PCa) and its clinical significance. METHODS Pathological sections and tumor tissues were collected from 80 patients with prostate cancer and prostate hyperplasia tissue biopsy from 52 patients from January 10,2015 to January10,2016. The expression of Nrf2 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The expression of Nrf2 mRNA and protein were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR(RT-qPCR) and western blot. The relationship of the expression of Nrf2 in tumor tissue of patients with prostate cancer and age,tumor size,serum PSA content,Gleason score,clinical stage,lymph node metastasis and chemotherapy resistance were analyzed. Culture DU145 cell line and siRNA were uesd to knockdown the expression of Nrf2 and the sensitivity of cells to docetaxel(DTX) was measured by MTT assay. RESULTS The relative expression level of Nrf2 mRNA and protein in prostate cancer tissues (3.61±1.75,2.55±1.03) was higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues (1.08±0.78,0.73±0.54),the difference was statistically significant (t=3.669,P=0.003 2). The positive rate of Nrf2 in prostate cancer (71.25%, 57/80) was higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia (7.69%,4/52),the difference was statistically significant(χ 2 =51.217,P&lt;0.001). The positive rate of Nrf2 in tumor tissue of patients with prostate cancer was correlated with serum PSA level,tumor size,Gleason score,clinical stage and lymph node metastasis(χ 2 =19.985,P=0.001; χ 2 =4.665,P=0.031; χ 2 =9.937,P=0.002; χ 2 =11.446,P=0.003,χ 2 =6.572,P=0.01),regardless of age(χ 2 =1.993,P=0.448). Sixty-two patients underwent DTX-based chemotherapy,of which 37 were chemotherapy sensitive and 25 were chemotherapy resistance. The positive rate of Nrf2 in chemotherapy sensitive group was 54.1% and 80.0% in chemotherapy resistance group,the difference was statistically significant(χ 2 =4.387,P&lt;0.036). The IC 50 of docetaxel,oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil at siNrf2 group were significantly lower than that of siCtrl group at 24,48 and 72 h,the differences were statistically significant,all P&lt;0.01. CONCLUSION Increased expression of Nrf2 in prostate cancer may be involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer and may serve as a target for tumor therapy. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains 1(PAG1) is a transmembrane adaptor protein in lipid raft,and has closed relationships with tumors. This study is to investigate the effect of PAG1 inhibition on inherent radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells. METHODS According to the human PAG1 mRNA sequence,three shRNA sequences were designed and synthesized,which were then inserted into the GV248 vectors by ligase. After being identified by sequencing,recombinant vectors were transfected into inherent-radioresistant laryngeal cancer cells Hep-2max by lipofectamine,respectively. The interference efficiency of recombinant vector was determined by real-time PCR and Western blot,and the most effective vector was selected. Hep-2max cells were then transfected with the vector containing the best targeting sequence,and puromycin was used to screen for the stable cell lines. After treatment with 8 Gy radiation,cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry. RESULTS Real-time PCR and Western blot showed that PAG1-shRNA1 was the most effective vector,and the stable cell line was also obtained. Flow cytometry showed that proportion of G 2 /M phase cell in blank control group,negative control group and shPAG1 group were (39.17±1.62)%,(35.58±1.94)% and (45.28±1.68)% respectively (F=9.837,P=0.013 1),and the apoptosis rates in blank control group,negative control group and shPAG1 group were (28.46±2.43)%,(29.25±2.89)% and (43.68±1.78)% respectively (F=12.67,P=0.011 1). CONCLUSION Inhibition of PAG1 expression could promote inherent-radioresistant laryngeal cancer cells Hep-2max apoptosis,and increase the proportion of G 2 /M phase cells,and then reverse the inherent radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells,and provide a new target for the radiosensitization of laryngeal cancer. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "In the past decade, the oncology community has witnessed major advances in the understanding of cancer biology and major breakthroughs in several different therapeutic areas, from solid tumors to hematological malignancies; moreover, the advent of effective immunotherapy approaches, such as immune-checkpoint blockade, is revolutionizing treatment algorithms in almost all oncology disease areas. As knowledge evolves and new weapons emerge in the \"war against cancer\", clinical and translational research need to adapt to a rapidly changing environment to effectively translate novel concepts into sustainable and accessible therapeutic options for cancer patients. With this in mind, translational cancer researchers, oncology professionals, treatment experts, CRO and industry leaders, as well as patient representatives gathered in London, 16-17 March 2017, for The International Congress on Clinical Trials in Oncology and Hemato-Oncology (ICTO2017), to discuss the changing face of oncology clinical trials in the new era of personalized medicine and immuno-oncology. A wide range of topics, including clinical trial design in immuno-oncology, biomarker-oriented drug development paths, statistical design and endpoint selection, challenges in the design and conduct of personalized medicine clinical trials, risk-based monitoring, financing and reimbursement, as well as best operational practices, were discussed in an open, highly interactive format, favoring networking among all relevant stakeholders. The most relevant data, approaches and issues emerged and discussed during the conference are summarized in this report. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Historical data indicate that surgical resection may benefit select patients with metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer. However, randomized clinical trials are lacking. The current RENAISSANCE trial addresses the potential benefits of surgical intervention in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer with limited metastases. Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, investigator-initiated phase III trial. Previously untreated patients with limited metastatic stage (retroperitoneal lymph node metastases only or a maximum of one incurable organ site that is potentially resectable or locally controllable with or without retroperitoneal lymph nodes) receive 4 cycles of FLOT chemotherapy alone or with trastuzumab if Her2+. Patients without disease progression after 4 cycles are randomized 1:1 to receive additional chemotherapy cycles or surgical resection of primary and metastases followed by subsequent chemotherapy. 271 patients are to be allocated to the trial, of which at least 176 patients will proceed to randomization. The primary endpoint is overall survival; main secondary endpoints are quality of life assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire, progression free survival and surgical morbidity and mortality. Recruitment has already started; currently (Feb 2017) 22 patients have been enrolled. Discussion: If the RENAISSANCE concept proves to be effective, this could potentially lead to a new standard of therapy. On the contrary, if the outcome is negative, patients with gastric or GEJ cancer and metastases will no longer be considered candidates for surgical intervention. Trial registration: The article reports of a health care intervention on human participants and is registered on October 12, 2015 under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02578368; EudraCT: 2014-002665-30. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Endometrial cancer (EC) is a major health concern due to its rising incidence. Whilst early stage disease is generally cured by surgery, advanced EC has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. Altered energy metabolism is a hallmark of malignancy. Cancer cells drive tumour growth through aerobic glycolysis and must export lactate to maintain intracellular pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of the lactate/proton monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 and their chaperone CD147 in EC, with the ultimate aim of directing future drug development. Methods: MCT1, MCT4 and CD147 expression was examined using immunohistochemical analysis in 90 endometrial tumours and correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics and survival outcomes. Results: MCT1 and MCT4 expression was observed in the cytoplasm, the plasma membrane or both locations. CD147 was detected in the plasma membrane and associated with MCT1 (p = 0.003) but not with MCT4 (p = 0.207) expression. High MCT1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival (p = 0.029) and remained statistically significant after adjustment for survival covariates (p = 0.017). Conclusion: Our data suggest that MCT1 expression is an important marker of poor prognosis in EC. MCT1 inhibition may have potential as a treatment for advanced or recurrent EC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previous studies show that overexpression of EMMPRIN involved in the malignant biological behavior of tumors. This investigation was to disclose the expression status of EMMPRIN in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its clinical value for the diagnosis of NSCLC. Methods: The expression of EMMPRIN was examined using immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The clinical value of EMMPRIN was evaluated by drawing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: NSCLC tissues and serum exhibited higher expression levels of EMMPRIN than the normal control (p < 0.05), and the expression of the EMMPRIN was significantly associated with lymphatic invasion and advanced stage of NSCLC (p < 0.05). ROC curve suggested that the threshold level of serum EMMPRIN for distinguishing NSCLC from control group was 80.3 pg/mL, and displayed a sensitivity of 97.22% and a specificity of 95%. And higher EMMPRIN expression in serum and tissues appeared to be risk factors for NSCLC development (risk ratio =1.56 and 1.1). Conclusion: Overexpression of EMMPRINwas associated with lymphatic metastasis and advanced stage of NSCLC and test of serum EMMPRIN contributes to the NSCLC diagnosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The objective of this work was to develop a survey that considered cultural relevance and diversity of South Asian populations, with the aim of describing or predicting factors that influence colorectal cancer screening intention and adherence. The scientifically rigorous approach for survey development informed the final phase of an exploratory mixed method study. This initial survey was later cross-culturally translated and adapted into the Urdu language, and thereafter, items were cognitively tested for conceptual relevance among South Asian immigrants. Results: The initial development of the Colon Cancer Screening Behaviours Survey for South Asian populations was completed using a number of steps. Development involved: the identification of key concepts and conceptual model; literature search for candidate measures and critical appraisal; and, expert consultation to select relevant measures. Five published surveys included measures that covered concepts relevant to South Asians and colorectal cancer screening behaviours. However, measures from these surveys missed content that emerged through parallel field work with South Asians, and additions were required along with item modifications. In the final stage, cross-cultural translation and adaptation into Urdu, and cognitive testing were completed. Future research will require an examination of proposed relationships, and psychometric testing of measures in the survey. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In early studies, it was shown that HINT2, which sensitizes cells to mitochondrial apoptosis, is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (Martin et al., 2006). However, the molecular mechanism of this effect is unknown. Immunohistochemistry revealed that HINT2 expression is relatively low in pancreatic cancer tissues, compared to that in adjacent tissues (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, its expression was related to pathological grade and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0161 and 0.0108, respectively); in addition, down-regulation of HINT2 was found to be associated with relatively poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Up-regulation of HINT2 was shown to trigger pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis, decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), promote intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and elevate mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels. However, co-treatment of HINT2 overexpressing BxPC-3 cells with ruthenium red partially inhibited HINT2-induced apoptosis, which was associated with a reduction in ΔΨm and an increase in intracellular ROS and mitochondrial Ca 2+ . According to our results, mitochondrial calcium uptake1 and 2 (MICU1 and MICU2) were down-regulated and the essential MCU regulator (EMRE) was up-regulated in cells transduced with Adv-HINT2. Therefore, we deduced that HINT2 triggers apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells by regulating mitochondrial Ca 2+ influx through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). In addition, we found that HINT2 can sensitize BxPC-3 and L3.6pl cells to gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and that gemcitabine up-regulates HINT2 expression. This indicates that gemcitabine-induced apoptosis is related to HINT2 levels. © 2017 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: The majority of patients with gastric or esophago-gastric cancer are at risk for malnutrition. Preoperative malnutrition was shown to increase the incidence of postoperative complications following abdominal surgery. However, it remains unclear if preoperative parenteral nutritional support during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) may be effective to reduce the rate of postoperative complications in these patients. Methods/Design: The PERCOG trial is a randomized controlled multicenter observer-blinded trial, investigating if the improvement of the general condition of patients with non-metastasized gastric cancer or cancer of the esophago-gastric junction during NACT by supplemental parenteral nutrition can decrease the postoperative Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Statistical analysis of the primary endpoint measure (CCI on postoperative day 30) will be based on the intention-to-treat population. The global level of significance is set at 5% and the sample size (n = 150) is determined to assure a power of 80%. Discussion: The results of the PERCOG trial will provide high-level evidence for clinical recommendations regarding the administration of preoperative supportive parenteral nutrition and provide all participating patients the opportunity of an improved treatment.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE To explore the predictive value of sentinel lymph nodal(SLN) status in patients with early breast cancer by combining color Doppler ultrasonography with clinical pathological characteristics.METHODS Clinical data of 1 491 patients with early breast cancer were retrieved from Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University between 2010-07-01 to 2016-12-31. Chi-square test and Logistic multivariate regression analysis were carried out to identify relevant factors predictive of sentinel limph nodal status. A probability level (P<0.05) was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The group was consisted of 1 491 patients whose ages ranged from 19 to 84 years old with an average of (48.8±10.5) years in age. Totally 27.0%(403/1 491) positive sentinel lymph nodes were found in all patients,and the mean number of sentinel lymph node removed by the surgeon was 4.43±2.42. In the univariate analysis,the incidence of entinel lymph node metastasis(ELNM) was significantly associated with pathological type(P<0.001),ER(P<0.001),PR(P<0.001),Ki-67(P=0.010) expression tumor size(P<0.001),tumor location(P=0.016),menopausal status(P=0.002),lymph node aspect ratio(P<0.001),the number of lymph node(P<0.001) and major axis(P=0.037),while age and HER2 status were irrelevant (P>0.05). In multivariate analyse,pathological type(P<0.001),ER receptor status(P=0.001),tumor size(P<0.05),menopausal status(P=0.004),limph node aspect ratio (P<0.001)and major axis(P<0.05) were the independent risk factors of ELNM(P<0.05). The new model was accurate and discriminating(with an AUC of 0.731 when applied to the modeling group,sensitivity was 72.5 percent and the specificity was 82.6 percent). CONCLUSIONS The tumor size,pathological type,menopausal status,ER receptor status,limph node aspect ratio and major axis were the independent risk factors of ELNM. In all,the logistic regression model has a good diagnostic efficacy in the diagnosis of benign and malignant axillary lymph nodes and has better sensitivity and specificity. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Maintaining reductive-oxidative (redox) balance is an essential feature in breast cancer cell survival, with cellular metabolism playing an integral role in maintaining redox balance through its supply of reduced NADPH. In the present studies, the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) on redox balance was investigated in early stages of breast cancer. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D promoted oxidative stress in MCF10A-ras and MCF10A-ErbB2 breast epithelial cells, as measured by the decreased ratios of NADPH/NADP+ and reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG). The mRNA and protein expression of the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) was downregulated with 1,25(OH)2D treatment, suggesting a potential mechanism. Genetic depletion of PC in MCF10A-ras cells resulted in a decreased ratio of NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG, with 1,25(OH)2D treatment having no further effect. Mutation analysis confirmed the presence and functionality of a vitamin D response element in the PC gene promoter region. Collectively, these results provide evidence that 1,25(OH)2D promotes oxidative stress in early breast cancer progression through transcriptional downregulation of PC. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Image-guided individual treatment based on regional tumor control rate has been a research hotspot of locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has become standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there was dissimilarity of volumetric shrinkage rate(VSR) between primary tumor and regionally-metastasized lymph nodes of locally advanced NSCLC treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and to explore the influential factors. METHODS A retrospective review identified patients diagnosed with locally advanced NSCLC in Shandong Cancer Hospital between July 1,2014 and December 31,2016. Thirty-two patients who both underwent baseline 18 F-FDG PET-CT scan within 4 weeks before treatment and treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. All enrolled patients received at least 50 Gy units of radiation. The target lesions were delineated on each patient's PET and CT images (enhanced planning CT and follow-up CT) respectively. Parameters such as metabolism parameters were automatically calculated and output as a table by MIM software. VSR and overall response rate (ORR) was calculated from gross tumor volume (GTV) delineated on CT scans. Relationship between VSR or ORR and metabolism parameters were analyzed. RESULTS (1) The average VSR of primary tumor was significantly higher than the average VSR of regionally-metastasized lymph nodes (59.8% vs 34.14%,z=-2.619,P=0.009). SUV max-nd (maximum standard uptake value of regionally-metastasized lymph node) was the only significant influential factor to VSR in multivariate analysis (OR=1.445,95%CI:0.891-2.344). (2) ORR in primary tumor was 56.3% and in regionally-metastasized lymph nodes was 31.0%. ORR was much more significant in primary tumor (χ 2 =6.326,P=0.012). Similarly,SUV max was the only significant influential factor to all NSCLC lesions in multivariate analysis (OR=0.845,95%CI:0.761-0.939). CONCLUSIONS In locally advanced NSCLC with concurrent chemoradiotherapy,VSR in primary tumor was more pronounced than regionally-involved lymph nodes and pretreatment SUV max may be a predictive variable. Similarly,SUV max-nd was an effective prognostic factor for short-term-efficacy of locally-advanced NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Background: Globally, cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality. High treatment cost, partly owing to higher prices of anti-cancer drugs, presents a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. The aim of the present study was to survey and compare retail prices of anti-cancer drugs between high, middle and low income countries in the South-East Asia, Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Methods: Cross-sectional survey design was used for the present study. Pricing data from ten counties including one from South-East Asia, two from Western Pacific and seven from Eastern Mediterranean regions were used in this study. Purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted mean unit prices for 26 anti-cancer drug presentations (similar pharmaceutical form, strength, and pack size) were used to compare prices of anti-cancer drugs across three regions. A structured form was used to extract relevant data. Data were entered and analysed using Microsoft Excel®. Results: Overall, Taiwan had the lowest mean unit prices while Oman had the highest prices. Six (23.1%) and nine (34.6%) drug presentations had a mean unit price below US$100 and between US$100 and US$500 respectively. Eight drug presentations (30.7%) had a mean unit price of more than US$1000 including cabazitaxel with a mean unit price of $17,304.9/vial. There was a direct relationship between income category of the countries and their mean unit price; low-income countries had lower mean unit prices. The average PPP-adjusted unit prices for countries based on their income level were as follows: low middle-income countries (LMICs): US$814.07; high middle income countries (HMICs): US$1150.63; and high income countries (HICs): US$1148.19. Conclusions: There is a great variation in pricing of anticancer drugs in selected countires and within their respective regions. These findings will allow policy makers to compare prices of anti-cancer agents with neighbouring countries and develop policies to ensure accessibility and affordability of anti-cancer drugs. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AIM To explore the pharmacological mechanism of E804, a derivative of indirubin, by investigating whether it can inhibit the viability of gastric cancer cells, alter the expression of markers of autophagy, and promote the autophagy activity. METHODS MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells were treated with different concentrations of E804. Non-treated MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells were used as negative controls, and those treated with interleukin-6 (100 ng/mL) for 2 h were used as a positive control. After treatment, cell viability was detected by MTT assay. The expression of autophagy markers was detected by Western blot. The diameter of transplantable tumor in a subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model was also measured. RESULTS The viability of both MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells declined significantly after treatment (P < 0.05). E804 increased the expression of LC3-B and Beclin-1, two markers of autophagy, in a dose-dependent manner. When comparing the maximal diameters of tumor in the control group (non-treated) and experimental group (treated with E804), the speed of tumor growth in the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION E804 can promote autophagy of gastric cancer cells to suppress their growth, at least partly by inhibiting the activation of Stat3. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast (IMPC) is a histological tumor variant that occurs with low frequency characterized by an inside-out formation of tumor clusters with a pseudopapillary arrangement. IMPC is an aggressive tumor with poor clinical outcome. In addition, this histological subtype usually expresses human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) which also correlates with a more aggressive tumor. In this work we studied the clinical significance of IMPC in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab. We also analyzed mucin 4 (MUC4) expression as a novel biomarker to identify IMPC. Methods: We retrospectively studied 86 HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. We explored the association of the IMPC component with clinicopathological parameters at diagnosis and its prognostic value. We compared MUC4 expression in IMPC with respect to other histological breast cancer subtypes by immunohistochemistry. Results: IMPC, either as a pure entity or associated with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), was present in 18.6% of HER2-positive cases. It was positively correlated with estrogen receptor expression and tumor size and inversely correlated with patient's age. Disease-free survival was significantly lower in patients with IMPC (hazard ratio = 2.6; 95%, confidence interval 1.1-6.1, P = 0.0340). MUC4, a glycoprotein associated with metastasis, was strongly expressed in all IMPC cases tested. IMPC appeared as the histological breast cancer subtype with the highest MUC4 expression compared to IDC, lobular and mucinous carcinoma. Conclusion: In HER2-positive breast cancer, the presence of IMPC should be carefully examined. As it is often not informed, because it is relatively difficult to identify or altogether overlooked, we propose MUC4 expression as a useful biomarker to highlight IMPC presence. Patients with MUC4-positive tumors with IMPC component should be more frequently monitored and/or receive additional therapies. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure is a main risk factor of lung cancer in never smokers. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations and ALK translocations are more frequent in never smokers' lung cancer than in ever-smokers. We performed a multicenter case-control study to assess if ETS exposure is associated with the presence of EGFR mutations and its types and if ALK translocations were related with ETS exposure. All patients were never smokers and had confirmed lung cancer diagnosis. ETS exposure during childhood showed a negative association on the probability of EGRF mutation though not significant. Exposure during adulthood, at home or at workplace, did not show any association with EGFR mutation. The mutation type L858R seemed the most associated with a lower probability of EGFR alterations for ETS exposure at home in adult life. There is no apparent association between ETS exposure and ALK translocation. These results might suggest that ETS exposure during childhood or at home in adult life could influence the EGFR mutations profile in lung cancer in never smokers, reducing the probability of presenting EFGR mutation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To evaluate the relation between 12 polymorphisms and the development of gastric cancer (GC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS In this study, we included 125 individuals with GC diagnosis, 66 individuals with CRC diagnosis and 475 cancer-free individuals. All participants resided in the North region of Brazil and authorized the use of their samples. The 12 polymorphisms (in CASP8 , CYP2E1 , CYP19A1 , IL1A , IL4 , MDM2 , NFKB1 , PAR1 , TP53 , TYMS , UGT1A1 and XRCC1 genes) were genotyped in a single PCR for each individual, followed by fragment analysis. To avoid misinterpretation due to population substructure, we applied a previously developed set of 61 ancestry-informative markers that can also be genotyped by multiplex PCR. The statistical analyses were performed in Structure v.2.3.4, R environment and SPSS v.20. RESULTS After statistical analyses with the control of confounding factors, such as genetic ancestry, three markers (rs79071878 in IL4 , rs3730485 in MDM2 and rs28362491 in NFKB1 ) were positively associated with the development of GC. One of these markers (rs28362491) and the marker in the UGT1A1 gene (rs8175347) were positively associated with the development of CRC. Therefore, we investigated whether the joint presence of the deleterious alleles of each marker could affect the development of cancer and we obtained positive results in all analyses. Carriers of the combination of alleles RP1 + DEL (rs79071878 and rs28361491, respectively) are at 10-times greater risk of developing GC than carriers of other combinations. Similarly, carriers of the combination of DEL + RARE (rs283628 and rs8175347) are at about 12-times greater risk of developing CRC than carriers of other combinations. CONCLUSION These findings are important for the comprehension of gastric and CRC development, particularly in highly admixed populations, such as the Brazilian population. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Chirality plays essential roles in life systems such that l-amino acids (LAAs) are predominantly found as the building units of protein for organisms. The presence of the d-enantiomer (DAA) has been found to be specifically relevant to gastric cancer. We herein construct a luminescent DNA/silver nanocluster based biosensing system to achieve rapid and specific detection of DAAs. As a proof of application, we detected DAAs in saliva samples from patients with gastric cancer, and the test results exhibited excellent specificity. Our detection system has the following major advantages: (i) the detection is rapid, being completed in less than 1 hour; (ii) the limit of detection falls in the effective range of DAA concentrations of gastric cancer at an early stage, indicating that our method is potentially suitable for early diagnosis of gastric cancer; (iii) the non-invasive sampling manner provides an adaptable system for point-of-care testing (POCT); and (iv) the system does not require any massive instruments or expensive reagents, which enables POCT as well. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Background: To examine the effects of recombinant human endostatin combined with radiotherapy on colorectal cancer HCT-116 cell xenografts in nude mice. Methods: Forty male BALB/c nude mice were injected with human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells to form xenografts and then randomized into the following 4 groups (each group comprised ten mice): a control group, an endostatin group (20 mg/kg endostatin once a day for 10 days), a radiotherapy group (a 6-Gy dose was administered via a 6-MV X-ray on day 5 post-inoculation), and a combination therapy group (radiotherapy with endostatin treatment). The tumor growth inhibition rate were detected. CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression and microvascular density (MVD) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The expression of VEGF protein was also detected by western blotting. Results: The tumor growth inhibition rate in the radiotherapy with endostatin treatment group was significantly higher than those in endostatin group or radiotherapy group (77.67% vs 12.31% and 38.59%; n = 8 per group, P < 0.05). The results of immunohistochemistry showed that treatment with radiotherapy induced significant increases in CD31, VEGF, and HIF-1α expression and MVD compared with treatment with saline, while treatment with endostatin or radiotherapy with endostatin induced reductions in CD31, VEGF, and HIF-1α expression and MVD compared with treatment with saline (n = 8 per group, P < 0.05). The results of western blotting showed that VEGF protein expression in radiotherapy group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group. However, VEGF protein expression in the endostatin or radiotherapy with endostatin groups was significantly decreased compared with that in the control group (n = 8 per group, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Endostatin combined with radiotherapy can significantly inhibit HCT-116 cell xenograft growth, possibly by inhibiting angiogenesis and attenuating tumor cell hypoxia. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AIM To assess whether elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is in the inferior prognosis for pathological lymph node-negative (pN0) gastric cancer (GC) patients who underwent D2 gastrectomy. METHODS About 469 pN0 GC patients, who received D2 radical gastrectomy were retrospectively analyzed. The X-tile plots cut-off point for CEA were 30.02 ng/mL using minimum P-value from log-rank ?2 statistics, and pN0 GC patients were assigned to two groups: those more than 30.02 ng/mL (n = 48; CEA-high group) and those less than 30.02 ng/mL (n = 421; CEA-low group). Clinicopathologic characteristics were compared using Pearson's ?2 or Fisher’s exact tests, and survival curves were so manufactured using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis were carried out using the logistic regression method. RESULTS The percentage of vessel carcinoma embolus (31.35% vs 17.1%) and advanced GC (T2-4b) (81.25% vs 65.32%) were higher in CEA-high group than CEA-low group. The CEA-positive patients had a significantly poorer prognosis than the CEA-nagetive patients in terms of overall survival (57.74% vs 90.69%, P &lt; 0.05), and no different was found between subgroup of T category, differentiation, nerve invasion, and vessel carcinoma embolus (all P &gt; 0.05). Multivariate survival analysis showed that CEA (OR = 4.924), and T category (OR = 2.214) were significant prognostic factors for stage pN0 GC (all P &lt; 0.05). Besides, only T category (OR = 1.962) was an independent hazard factor in the CEA-high group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION Those pretreatment serum CEA levels over 30.02 ng/mL on behalf of worse characteristics and unfavourable tumor behavior, and a poor prognosis for a nearly doubled risk of mortality in GC patients. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) binds and regulates IκB kinase (IKK) and is required for NF-κB activation. The NEMO-binding domain peptide (NBDP) of IKK was found to inhibit NF-κB activation and promote apoptosis in cancer cells. Studies have shown that constitutive NF-κB activation, one of the signature molecular alterations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is a potential therapeutic target. However, preclinical and therapeutic evidence that supports direct targeting of IKK activation in therapy is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine whether the combination of NBDP and gemcitabine would sensitize pancreatic cancer to the gemcitabine. We confirmed that NBDP inhibited NF-κB activation and found that NBDP indeed promoted chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine in PDAC. NBDP increased PARP and caspase 3 cleavage in the apoptosis pathway, increased apoptosis of PDAC cells, and suppressed PDAC cell growth in vitro. In addition, NBDP combined with gemcitabine significantly decreased levels of NF-κB activity and inhibited the growth of PDAC in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Mechanistic investigations showed that NBDP effectively competed with NEMO/IKKγ for binding to IKKs and thus inhibited IKK and NF-κB activation, down-regulated expression levels of Erk, and decreased PDAC cell growth. Taken together, our current data demonstrate that NBDP sensitizes human pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. NBDP is a potential adjuvant chemotherapeutic agent for treating pancreatic cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Lung squamous carcinoma,also known as lung squamous cell carcinoma,is a very high incidence and mortality of malignant tumor. The pathogenesis of lung squamous carcinoma is not clear,and we here presented an effective method to identify lung squamous carcinoma risk pathway,helping to elucidate the pathogenesis of lung squamous carcinoma.METHODS We first integrated eight public database resources to obtain regulation data about transcription factor (TF),long non-coding RNA (lncRNA),miRNA and Gene. Then transcriptome sequencing data including TF,lncRNA,miRNA and Gene about lung squamous carcinoma were obtained from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data resources. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated about these regulation relationships,and we got a transcriptional regulatory network associated with lung squamous cell carcinoma. Taking each node with zero in-degree as the starting node,we identified the cascade pathways from the network using the breadth-first search algorithm. Lung cancer related TF,lncRNA,miRNA and Gene were downloaded from disease databases,and we annotated the cascade pathways with lung cancer information. The cascades with high disease annotation rate were regarded as lung squamous carcinoma risk pathways.RESULTS We integrated eight public database resources to retrieve 21 597 candidate regulation relationships, including TF versus lncRNA,miRNA and Gene,lncRNA versus TF and Gene and miRNA versus TF,lncRNA and Gene. After filtering the pairs with spearman correlation coefficients P-value<0.01,we constructed a lung squamous carcinoma related regulatory network,including 2 234 pairs consisted of 91 TFs,552 lncRNAs,125 miRNAs and 937 Genes. By breadth-first search algorithm,we identified 10 941 cascades. After annotated these cascades with lung cancer information,36 cascades with annotation ratio 1 were obtained,and these cascades were deemed as lung squamous carcinoma risk pathways. In the end,we provided nine candidate small molecules for lung squamous carcinoma therapy based on identified risk pathways.CONCLUSION The constructed transcriptional regulation network can help to identify lung squamous carcinoma risk pathways,explain the pathogenesis of lung squamous cell carcinoma and predict the candidate clinical drugs for lung squamous carcinoma therapy. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Background: Endometrial cancers (ECs) are one of the most common types of malignant tumor in females. Substantial efforts had been made to identify significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in ECs and use them as biomarkers for the classification of histological subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. However, the impact of non-significantly mutated genes (non-SMGs), which may also play important roles in the prognosis of EC patients, has not been extensively studied. Therefore, it is essential for the discovery of biomarkers in ECs to further investigate the non-SMGs that were highly associated with clinical outcomes. Results: For the 9681 non-SMGs reported by the mutation annotation pipeline, there were 1053, 1273 and 395 non-SMGs differentially expressed between the patient groups divided by the clinical endpoints of histological grade, histological type as well as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage of ECs, respectively. In the gene set enrichment analysis, the cancer-related pathways, namely neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway, were significantly enriched with the differentially expressed non-SMGs for all the three endpoints. We further identified 23, 19 and 24 non-SMGs, which were highly associated with histological grade, histological type and FIGO stage, respectively, from the differentially expressed non-SMGs by using the variable combination population analysis (VCPA) approach and found that 69.6% (16/23), 78.9% (15/19) and 66.7% (16/24) of the identified non-SMGs had been previously reported to be correlated with cancers. In addition, the averaged areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) achieved by the predictive models with identified non-SMGs as predictors in predicting histological type, histological grade, and FIGO stage were 0.993, 0.961 and 0.832, respectively, which were superior to those achieved by the models with SMGs as features (averaged AUCs = 0.928, 0.864 and 0.535, resp.). Conclusions: Besides the SMGs, the non-SMGs reported in the mutation annotation analysis may also involve the crucial genes that were highly associated with clinical outcomes. Combining the mutation status with the gene expression profiles can efficiently identify the cancer-related non-SMGs as predictors for cancer prognostic prediction and provide more supplemental candidates for the discovery of biomarkers. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Neuropilin and tolloid-like 2 (NETO2) is a single-pass transmembrane protein that has been shown primarily implicated in neuron-specific processes. Upregulation of NETO2 gene was also detected in several cancer types. In colorectal cancer (CRC), it was associated with tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis, and seems to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the mechanism of NETO2 action is still poorly understood. Results: We have revealed significant increase in the expression of NETO2 gene and deregulation of eight EMT-related genes in CRC. Four of them were upregulated (TWIST1, SNAIL1, LEF1, and FOXA2); the mRNA levels of other genes (FOXA1, BMP2, BMP5, and SMAD7) were decreased. Expression of NETO2 gene was weakly correlated with that of genes involved in the EMT process. Conclusions: We found considerable NETO2 upregulation, but no significant correlation between the expression of NETO2 and EMT-related genes in CRC. Thus, NETO2 may be involved in CRC progression, but is not directly associated with EMT. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: FHIT is a genome caretaker/tumor suppressor that is silenced in &gt;50% of cancers. Although it was identified more than 20 years ago, questions remain as to how FHIT loss contributes to cancer, and conversely, how FHIT acts to maintain genome integrity and suppress malignancy. Fhit belongs to the histidine triad family of enzymes that catalyze the degradation of nucleoside 5',5'-triphosphates, including the m7GpppN 'caps' that are generated when mRNAs undergo 3'-5' decay. This raised the possibility that Fhit loss might affect changes in the translation of cancer-associated mRNAs, possibly as a consequence of increased intracellular concentrations of these molecules. Results: Ribosome profiling identified several hundred mRNAs for which coding region ribosome occupancy changed as a function of Fhit expression. While many of these changes could be explained by changes in mRNA steady-state, a subset of these showed changes in translation efficiency as a function of Fhit expression. The onset of malignancy has been linked to changes in 5'-UTR ribosome occupancy and this analysis also identified ribosome binding to 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of a number of cancer-associated mRNAs. 5'-UTR ribosome occupancy of these mRNAs differed between Fhit-negative and Fhit-positive cells, and in some cases these differences correlated with differences in coding region ribosome occupancy. Conclusions: In summary, these findings show Fhit expression impacts the translation of a number of cancer associated genes, and they support the hypothesis that Fhit's genome protective/tumor suppressor function is associated with post-transcriptional changes in expression of genes whose dysregulation contributes to malignancy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Adoptive immunotherapy offers great potential for treating many types of cancer but its clinical application is hampered by cross-reactive T cell responses in healthy human tissues, representing serious safety risks for patients. We previously developed a computational tool called Expitope for assessing cross-reactivity (CR) of antigens based on tissue-specific gene expression. However, transcript abundance only indirectly indicates protein expression. The recent availability of proteome-wide human protein abundance information now facilitates a more direct approach for CR prediction. Here we present a new version 2.0 of Expitope, which computes all naturally possible epitopes of a peptide sequence and the corresponding CR indices using both protein and transcript abundance levels weighted by a proposed hierarchy of importance of various human tissues. Results: We tested the tool in two case studies: The first study quantitatively assessed the potential CR of the epitopes used for cancer immunotherapy. The second study evaluated HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes obtained from the Immune Epitope Database for different disease groups and demonstrated for the first time that there is a high variation in the background CR depending on the disease state of the host: compared to a healthy individual the CR index is on average two-fold higher for the autoimmune state, and five-fold higher for the cancer state. Conclusions: The ability to predict potential side effects in normal tissues helps in the development and selection of safer antigens, enabling more successful immunotherapy of cancer and other diseases. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Breast cancer is the first female malignant tumor,of which 20% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer patients can take the targeted drugs trastuzumab(TZB) treatment,but drug resistance seriously affects the efficacy of TZB. This study is to investigate the effect of long non-coding RNA H19 (H19) on TZB resistance of human breast cancer cell BT-474 and correlated mechanism. METHODS Totally 37 cases of breast cancer tissue and corresponding para-cancerous tissues were collected in Department of General Surgery of Second People's Hospital of Dezhou from April 1,2016 to March 31,2017. Fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) technique was used to detect the expression of H19 and HER2,and analyze the relevance between the expression of H19 and HER2. Intermittent concentration gradient method was used to construct the BT-474 TZB resistance cell line (BT-474 TR). The lentiviral interference mediated H19 small interfering RNA (siRNA) vector was used to construct the stable interference of H19 cell line and corresponding blank control cell lines (BT-474 TR-siH19 and BT-474 TR-control). CCK-8 assay was used to detect TZB half inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of cells. qPCR was used to detect the expression of H19 and HER2 mRNA of cells. Western Blot was used to detect the protein expression of HER2 and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) related molecular. RESULTS The expression of H19 in breast cancer (0.192±0.014) was significantly higher than that in paracancerous tissues (0.082±0.009),t=40.202,P&lt;0.001; The expression of HER2 in breast cancer (0.156±0.013) was significantly higher than that in paracancerous tissues (0.058±0.009),P&lt;0.001,and there was a significant positive correlation with the expression of HER2 and H19 (r=0.483,P&lt;0.05). TZB IC 50 of BT-474-TR,BT-474,BT-474 TR-siH19,BT-474 TR-control were respectively (152.9±25.2),(27.7±3.6),(73.2±12.9),(142.3±23.5) μg/mL,and the difference was statistically significant(F=18.15,P=0.000 6). SNK-q test showed that there was statistically significant between BT-474-TR and BT-474,BT-474 TR-siH19 and BT-474 TR-control,P&lt;0.05. The expression level of H19 in BT-474 TR cells (0.239±0.031) was significantly higher than that in BT-474 cells (0.106±0.009),t=7.136,P&lt;0.001. The expression level of HER2 mRNA in BT-474 TR cells (0.127±0.031) was significantly lower than that in BT-474 cells (0.309±0.035),t=6.742,P&lt;0.001. The expression level of H19 in BT-474 TR-siH19 cells 0.073±0.007 was significantly lower than that in BT-474 TR-control (0.226±0.025),t=10.207,P&lt;0.001. The expression level of HER2 mRNA in BT-474 TR-siH19 cells (0.104±0.017) was significantly lower than that in BT-474 TR-control cells (0.162±0.028),t=3.069,P&lt;0.05. The expression level of HER2 protein in BT-474 TR cells (0.263±0.037) cells was significantly lower than that in BT-474 cells (0.681±0.059),t=10.395,P&lt;0.001. The expression level of E-cadherin protein in BT-474 TR cells was (0.162±0.025) and was significantly lower than that in BT-474 cells (0.633±0.074),t=10.447,P&lt;0.001.The expression level of Snail protein in BT-474 TR cells (0.207±0.083) was significantly higher than that in BT-474 cells (0.064±0.011),t=2.958,P=0.021. The expression level of Vimentin protein in BT-474 TR cells (0.168±0.020) was significantly higher than that in BT-474 cells (0.114±0.012),t=4.011,P=0.008. The expression level of HER2 protein in BT-474 TR-siH19 cells (0.082±0.007) was significantly lower than that in BT-474 TR-control cells (0.404±0.028),t=19.324,P&lt;0.001. The expression of Snail protein in BT-474 TR-siH19 cells (0.078±0.003) was significantly lower than that in BT-474 TR-control cells (0.258±0.021),t=14.697,P&lt;0.001. The expression of Vimentin protein in BT-474 TR-siH19 cells (0.085±0.010) was significantly lower than that in BT-474 TR-control (0.141±0.025),t=3.602,P=0.011. The expression of E-cadherin protein in BT-474 TR-siH19 cells (0.525±0.039) was significantly higher than that in BT-474 TR-control (0.194±0.034),t=11.081,P&lt;0.001. CONCLUSIONS H19 is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and is positively related to HER2 expression. Interference with H19 in vitro can down-regulate the expression of HER2 in breast cancer cells,and partly reverse the TZB resistance of breast cancer cells by inhibiting the EMT process. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Novel hybrid molecule containing 2-mercaptoethylamine was synthesized starting from O-propyloxime-N-propoxy bacteriopurpurinimide (dipropoxy-BPI), which was readily oxidized in oxygen atmosphere yielding the corresponding disulfide analogue (disulfide-BPI). Spectral, photophysical, photodynamic, and biological properties of compound were properly evaluated. Compounds bearing disulfide moiety can directly interact with glutathione (GSH), thereby reducing its intracellular concentration. Indeed, mice sarcoma S37 cell line was treated in vitro with disulfide-BPI, yielding a CC 50 value of 0.05 ± 0.005 μM. A relatively high level of singlet oxygen was detected. It was demonstrated (by fluorescence) that the PS was rapidly accumulated in a cancer nest (S37) at a relatively high level after 2 h upon intravenous administration. After 24 h, no traces of the molecule were detected in the tumor mass. Moreover, high photodynamic efficiency was demonstrated at doses of 150-300 J/cm 2 against two different in vivo tumor models, achieving 100% regression of cancer growth. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To investigate the inhibitory effect of astragaloside IV on the pathological functions of cancer-associated fibroblasts, and to explore the underlying mechanism. METHODS Paired gastric normal fibroblast (GNF) and gastric cancer-associated fibroblast (GCAF) cultures were established from resected tissues. GCAFs were treated with vehicle control or different concentrations of astragaloside ?. Conditioned media were prepared from GNFs, GCAFs, control-treated GCAFs, and astragaloside ?-treated GCAFs, and used to culture BGC-823 human gastric cancer cells. Proliferation, migration and invasion capacities of BGC-823 cells were determined by MTT, wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays, respectively. The action mechanism of astragaloside ? was investigated by detecting the expression of microRNAs and the expression and secretion of the oncogenic factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and the tumor suppressive factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2), in different groups of GCAFs. The expression of the oncogenic pluripotency factors SOX2 and NANOG in BGC-823 cells cultured with different conditioned media was also examined. RESULTS GCAFs displayed higher capacities to induce BGC-823 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion than GNFs (P < 0.01). Astragaloside ? treatment strongly inhibited the proliferation-, migration- and invasion-promoting capacities of GCAFs (P < 0.05 for 10 µmol/L, P < 0.01 for 20 µmol/L and 40 µmol/L). Compared with GNFs, GCAFs expressed a lower level of microRNA-214 (P < 0.01) and a higher level of microRNA-301a (P < 0.01). Astragaloside ? treatment significantly up-regulated microRNA-214 expression (P < 0.01) and down-regulated microRNA-301a expression (P < 0.01) in GCAFs. Reestablishing the microRNA expression balance subsequently suppressed M-CSF production (P < 0.01) and secretion (P < 0.05), and elevated TIMP2 production (P < 0.01) and secretion (P < 0.05). Consequently, the ability of GCAFs to increase SOX2 and NANOG expression in BGC-823 cells was abolished by astragaloside ?. CONCLUSION Astragaloside ? can inhibit the pathological functions of GCAFs by correcting their dysregulation of microRNA expression, and it is promisingly a potent therapeutic agent regulating tumor microenvironment. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "AIM To evaluate the safety and efficacy of totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) with esophagojejunostomy using a linear stapler compared with laparoscopic-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) using a circular stapler in gastric cancer patients. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 687 patients who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer at a single institution from August 2008 to August 2014. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of operation: 421 patients underwent TLTG and 266 underwent LATG. Clinicopathologic characteristics and surgical outcomes in the two groups were compared and analyzed. RESULTS The TLTG group had higher mean ages at the time of operation (57.78 ± 11.20 years and 55.69 ± 11.96 years, P = 0.020) and more histories of abdominal surgery (20.2% and 12.4%, P = 0.008) compared with the LATG group. Surgical outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative transfusions, combined operations, pain scores and administration of analgesics, and complications were similar between the two groups. However, compared with the LATG group, the TLTG group required a shorter operation time (149 min vs 170 min, P < 0.001), had lower postoperative hematocrit change (3.49% vs 4.04%, P = 0.002), less intraoperative events (3.1% vs 10.2%, P < 0.001), less intraoperative anastomosis events (2.4% vs 7.1%, P = 0.003), faster postoperative recovery such as median time to first flatus (3.30 d vs 3.60 d, P < 0.001), faster median commencement of soft diet (4.30 d vs 4.60 d, P < 0.001) and shorter length of postoperative hospital stay (6.75 d vs 7.02 d, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION The intracorporeal method for reconstruction of esophagojejunostomy using a linear stapler may be considered a feasible procedure comparing with extracorporeal anastomosis using circular stapler because TLTG is simpler and more straightforward than LATG. Therefore, TLTG can be recommended as an appropriate procedure for gastric cancer. © The author(s) 2017. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway effector GLI1 is linked to tumorigenesis and invasiveness in a number of cancers, with targeting of GLI1 by small molecule antagonists shown to be effective. We profiled a collection of GLI antagonists possessing distinct mechanisms of action for efficacy in phenotypic models of inflammatory and non-inflammatory breast cancer (IBC and non-IBC) that we showed expressed varying levels of Hh pathway mediators. Compounds GANT61, HPI-1, and JK184 decreased cell proliferation, inhibited GLI1 mRNA expression and decreased the number of colonies formed in TN-IBC (SUM149) and TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and SUM159) cell lines. In addition, GANT61 and JK184 significantly down-regulated GLI1 targets that regulate cell cycle (cyclin D and E) and apoptosis (Bcl2). GANT61 reduced SUM149 spheroid growth and emboli formation, and in orthotopic SUM149 tumor models significantly decreased tumor growth. We successfully utilized phenotypic profiling to identify a subset of GLI1 antagonists that were prioritized for testing in in vivo models. Our results indicated that GLI1 activation in TN-IBC as in TNBC, plays a vital role in promoting cell proliferation, motility, tumor growth, and formation of tumor emboli. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background. Models of cancer-induced neuropathy are designed by injecting cancer cells near the peripheral nerves. -e interference of tissue-resident immune cells does not allow a direct contact with nerve 2bres which a3ects the tumor microenvironment and the invasion process. Methods. Anaplastic tumor-1 (AT-1) cells were inoculated within the sciatic nerves (SNs) of male Copenhagen rats. Lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the SNs were collected on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. SN tissues were examined for morphological changes and DRG tissues for immuno=uorescence, electrophoretic tendency, and mRNA quanti2cation. Hypersensitivities to cold, mechanical, and thermal stimuli were determined. HC-030031, a selective TRPA1 antagonist, was used to treat cold allodynia. Results. Nociception thresholds were identi2ed on day 6. Immuno=uorescent micrographs showed overexpression of TRPA1 on days 7 and 14 and of CGRP on day 14 until day 21. Both TRPA1 and CGRP were coexpressed on the same cells. Immunoblots exhibited an increase in TRPA1 expression on day 14. TRPA1 mRNA underwent an increase on day 7 (normalized to 18S). Injection of HC-030031 transiently reversed the cold allodynia. Conclusion. A novel and a promising model of cancer-induced neuropathy was established, and the role of TRPA1 and CGRP in pain transduction was examined. Copyright © 2017 Ahmad Maqboul and Bakheet Elsadek.",

    "Abstract": "The identification of new therapeutic strategies is urgently needed for the management of patients affected by anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) due to their short survival and poor prognosis. Aim of the study was to determine the activity of the combination irinotecan/sunitinib on ATC cell growth in vitro and the antitumor effects in vivo. Proliferation assays were performed for 72 h on ATC cell lines exposed to the combination of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, and sunitinib. The simultaneous combination of sunitinib and SN-38, quantified by the combination index, determined a high synergism on ATC cells, increasing the intracellular concentrations of SN-38. Moreover, the synergistic combination greatly decreases the gene expression and the protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, colony stimulating factor 1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter G2 in ATC cells. A significant in vivo antitumor effect was observed in ATC xenografts with the simultaneous combination of irinotecan and sunitinib if compared to monotherapy. The simultaneous combination of irinotecan and sunitinib, in vitro and in vivo demonstrated a significant, synergistic ATC antitumor activity, suggesting a possible and rapid translation of this schedule into the clinics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Upon the basis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set, we identified that several autophagy-related proteins such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were remarkably downregulated in breast cancer. Combined with coimmunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that BRD4 might interact with AMPK. After analyses of the pharmacophore and WPF interaction optimization, we designed a small-molecule inhibitor of BRD4, 9f (FL-411) which was validated by cocrystal structure with BD1 of BRD4. Subsequently, 9f was discovered to induce ATG5-dependent autophagy-associated cell death (ACD) by blocking BRD4-AMPK interaction and thus activating AMPK-mTOR-ULK1-modulated autophagic pathway in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the iTRAQ-based proteomics analyses revealed that 9f induced ACD pathways involved in HMGB1, VDAC1/2, and eEF2. Moreover, 9f displayed a therapeutic potential on both breast cancer xenograft mouse and zebrafish models. Together, these results demonstrate that a novel small-molecule inhibitor of BRD4 induces BRD4-AMPK-modulated ACD in breast cancer, which may provide a candidate drug for future cancer therapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Despite clinical remission of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) after surgical resection and first-line chemotherapy, about 60% of patients will re-develop peritoneal metastasis and about 50% will relapse with chemoresistant disease. Clinical studies suggest that intra-peritoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy effectively treats residual EOC after cyto-reduction by gaining direct access into the peritoneal cavity, enabling elevated drug levels versus intravenous (i.v.) injection. However, chemoresistant disease is still problematic. To overcome resistance against microtubule stabilizing agents such as taxanes, epothilone B (EpoB) has merit, especially in combination with molecular targeted agents that inhibit heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and/or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In this paper, we report on the successful loading and solubilization of EpoB in a poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA) thermosensitive gel (g-E). Further, we report on successful co-loading of 17-AAG (Hsp90) and rapamycin (mTOR) (g-EAR). After i.p. injection in mice, g-EAR showed gelation in the peritoneum and sustained, local-regional release of EpoB, 17-AAG, and rapamycin. In a luciferase-expressing ES-2 (ES-2-luc) ovarian cancer xenograft model, single i.p. injections of g-E and g-EAR delayed bioluminescence from metastasizing ES-2-luc cells for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively, despite fast drug release for g-EAR in vivo versus in vitro. In summary, a PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA sol-gel has loading and release capacities for EpoB and its combinations with 17-AAG and rapamycin, enabling a platform for i.p. delivery, sustained multi-drug exposure, and potent antitumor efficacy in an ES-2-luc, ovarian cancer i.p. xenograft model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A conceptually new bimodal immunoradiotherapy treatment was demonstrated using thermoresponsive polymer β-glucan-graft-poly(2-isopropyl-2-oxazoline-co-2-butyl-2-oxazoline) bearing complexes of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid with yttrium-90(III) at the graft ends. The behavior of this thermoresponsive polymer in aqueous solutions was studied, and it showed the appropriate cloud point temperature for brachytherapy applications. The polymer was tested in vitro, and it exhibited nontoxicity and active uptake into cancer cells and macrophages with colocalization in the lysosomes and macrophagosomes. Moreover, the observed oxidative burst response of the leukocytes established the immunostimulatory properties of the polymer, which were also studied in vivo after injection into the thigh muscles of healthy mice. The subsequent histological evaluation revealed the extensive immune activation reactions at the site of injection. Furthermore, the production of tumor necrosis factor α induced by the prepared polymer was observed in vitro, denoting the optimistic prognosis of the treatment. The biodistribution study in vivo indicated the formation of the polymer depot, which was gradually degraded and excluded from the body. The radiolabeled polymer was used during in vivo antitumor efficiency experiments on mice with EL4 lymphoma. The immunoradiotherapy group (treated with the radiolabeled polymer) demonstrated the complete inhibition of tumor growth during the beginning of the treatment. Moreover, 7 of the 15 mice were completely cured in this group, while the others exhibited significantly prolonged survival time compared to the control group. The in vivo experiments indicated the considerable synergistic effect of using immunoradiotherapy compared to separately using immunotherapy or radiotherapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "There are currently no clinically validated therapeutic targets for biliary tract cancer (BTC). Despite promising results in other cancers, compounds targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, alone or in combination with Ras/Raf/MEK pathway inhibitors, have not been evaluated in BTC. Here, we examined the effects of a pan-PI3K inhibitor (BKM120) with or without a MEK inhibitor (MEK162), on eight human BTC cell lines carrying mutations in K-Ras and/or the PI3K catalytic subunit, PI3KCA. BKM120 inhibited the colony-forming ability and migration of BTC cells carrying wild-type (WT) PI3KCA and either mutant (MT) or WT K-Ras, but not of cells carrying mutations in both genes. In K-Ras-WT cells, BKM120 decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, its downstream effector kinase p70S6K, and the translational repressor 4E-BP1. Interestingly, BKM120 did not induce cell cycle arrest or suppress PI3K signaling via restoration of p-4E-BP1 in cells with PIK3CA and K-Ras double mutations. Notably, the resistance of dual K-Ras/PI3KCA-mutant cells to BKM120 was overcome by treatment with a combination of BKM120 and MEK162. Our findings thus support the clinical development of BKM120 monotherapy or BKM120/MEK162 combination therapy for the treatment of BTC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To examine the evidence about psychiatric morbidity after inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related surgery. METHODS PRISMA guidelines were followed and a protocol was published at PROSPERO (CRD42016037600). Inclusion criteria were studies describing patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing surgery and their risk of developing psychiatric disorder. RESULTS Twelve studies (including 4340 patients) were eligible. All studies were non-randomized and most had high risk of bias. Patients operated for inflammatory bowel disease had an increased risk of developing depression, compared with surgical patients with diverticulitis or inguinal hernia, but not cancer. In addition, patients with Crohn’s disease had higher risk of depression after surgery compared with non-surgical patients. Patients with ulcerative colitis had higher risk of anxiety after surgery compared with surgical colorectal cancer patients. Charlson comorbidity score more than three and female gender were independent predictors for depression and anxiety following surgery. CONCLUSION The review cannot give any clear answer to the risks of psychiatric morbidity after surgery for IBD studies with the lowest risk of bias indicated an increased risk of depression among surgical patients with Crohn’s disease and increased risk of anxiety among patients with ulcerative colitis. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting therapies rely on the dependence of tumors on new blood vessels to sustain tumor growth. We previously reported a potent vascular disrupting agent, a theranostic nanosystem consisting of a tumor vasculature-homing peptide (CGKRK) fused to a pro-apoptotic peptide [D(KLAKLAK)2] coated on iron oxide nanoparticles. This nanosystem showed promising therapeutic efficacy in glioblastoma (GBM) and breast cancer models. However, complete control of the tumors was not achieved, and some tumors became non-responsive to the treatment. Here we examined the non-responder phenomenon in an aggressive MCF10-CA1a breast tumor model. In the treatment-resistant tumors we noted the emergence of CD31-negative patent neovessels and a concomitant loss of tumor homing of the nanosystem. In vivo phage library screening in mice bearing non-responder tumors showed that compared to untreated and treatment-sensitive tumors, treatment sensitive tumors yield a distinct landscape of vascular homing peptides characterized by over-representation of peptides that target αv integrins. Our approach may be generally applicable to the development of targeted therapies for tumors that have failed treatment. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "AIM To explore the features and prognostic value of lymph node metastasis in patients with T1-stage colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS In all, 321 cases of T1-stage CRC were selected from 10132 patients with CRC who received surgical therapy in six large-scale hospitals in China and were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the risk factors for lymphatic metastasis. A survival analysis was then performed to analyze the prognostic value of lymph node metastasis. RESULTS The occurrence rate of T1 stage was 3.17% (321/10132); of these patients, the lymph node metastasis rate was 8.41% (27/321), and the non-lymph node metastasis rate was 91.59% (294/321). Univariate analysis showed that preoperative serum CEA, preoperative serum CA199, preoperative serum CA724, vascular invasion, and degree of differentiation were associated with lymph node metastasis in T1-stage CRC (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Multivariate analysis indicated that preoperative serum CA724, vascular invasion, and degree of differentiation were closely related to lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Log-rank survival analysis showed that age, preoperative serum CEA, preoperative serum CA199, vascular invasion, degree of differentiation, and lymph node metastasis (? 2 = 24.180, P &lt; 0.001) were predictors of 5-year overall survival (OS) (P &lt; 0.05 for all). COX regression analysis demonstrated that preoperative serum CA199 and lymph node metastasis (HR = 5.117; P &lt; 0.05; 95%CI: 0.058-0.815) were independent prognostic indicators of 5-year OS in patients with T1-stage CRC (P &lt; 0.05 for both). CONCLUSION The morbidity of T1-stage CRC was 3.17% for all CRC cases. Preoperative serum CA724, vascular invasion, and degree of differentiation are independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis. Lymph node metastasis is an independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with T1-stage CRC. © The Author(s) 2017. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cannot be efficiently controlled using existing chemotherapy and radiotherapy approaches, indicating the need for new therapeutic strategies. Although ABT-737, a B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor, exerts anticancer effects against BCL-2-expressing SCLC, monotherapy with ABT-737 is associated with limited clinical activity because of the development of resistance and toxicity. Here, we examined whether combination therapy with ABT-737 and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor NVP-AUY922 exerted synergistic anticancer effects on SCLC. We found that the combination of ABT-737 and NVP-AUY922 synergistically induced the apoptosis of BCL-2-expressing SCLC cells. NVP-AUY922 downregulated the expression of AKT and ERK, which activate MCL-1 to induce resistance against ABT-737. The synergistic effect was also partly due to blocking NF-κB activation, which induces anti-apoptosis protein expressions. However, interestingly, targeting BCL-2 and MCL-1 or BCL2 and NF-κB did not induce the cytotoxicity. In conclusion, our study showed that combination of BCL2 inhibitor with HSP90 inhibitor increased activity in in vitro and in vivo study in only BCL-2 expressing SCLC compared to either single BCL2 inhibitor or HSP inhibitor. The enhanced activity might be led by blocking several apoptotic pathways simultaneously rather than a specific pathway. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "IQGAP1 is a conserved multifunctional protein implicated in tumorigenesis. An aberrant expression of IQGAP1 widely exists in many cancers, but the SUMOylation modification of IQGAP1 in carcinogenesis is unknown by now. Here we first time explore biological functions of IQGAP1 SUMOylation in promoting colorectal cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. The expression of IQGAP1 and its SUMOylation level are both increased in human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells and tissues. IQGAP1 is mainly SUMOylated by SUMO1 at the K1445 residue, which could stabilize IQGAP1 by reducing protein ubiquitination. IQGAP1 SUMOylation improves CRC cell growth, cell migration and tumorigenesis in vivo through activating the phosphorylation of ERK, MEK and AKT. While the SUMOylation site mutation at K1445 of IQGAP1 greatly reduces CRC cell proliferation, migration ability and tumor growth of CRC-xenograft mice by suppressing phosphorylation of ERK, MEK and AKT. Our findings discover the IQGAP1 SUMOylation is a novel regulatory mechanism to enhance tumorigenesis and development of CRC in vitro and in vivo. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Biological therapies based on recombinant proteins such as antibodies or cytokines are continuously improving the repertoire of treatments against cancer. However, safety and efficacy of this approach is often limited by inappropriate biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the proteins when they are administered systemically. Local administration of gene therapy vectors encoding these proteins would be a feasible alternative if they could mediate long-term and controlled expression of the transgene after a single intratumoral administration. We describe a new vector platform specially designed for this purpose. Different combinations of transactivators and promoters were evaluated to obtain a fully humanized inducible system responsive to the well-characterized drug mifepristone. The optimal transactivator conformation was based on DNA binding domains from the chimeric protein ZFHD1 fused to the progesterone receptor ligand binding domain and the NFkb p65 activation domain. The expression of this hybrid transactivator under the control of the elongation factor 1α (EF1α) or the chimeric CAG promoters ensured functionality of the system in a variety of cancer types. Expression cassettes with luciferase as a reporter gene were incorporated into High-Capacity adenoviral vectors (HC-Ad) for in vivo evaluation. Systemic administration of the vectors into C57BL/6 mice revealed that the vector based on the EF1α promoter (HCA-EF-ZP) allows tight control of transgene expression and remains stable for at least two months, whereas the CAG promoter suffers a progressive inactivation. Using an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice we show that the local administration of HCA-EF-ZP achieves better tumor/liver ratio of luciferase production than the intravenous route. However, regional spread of the vector led to substantial transgene expression in peritoneal organs. We reduced this leakage through genetic modification of the vector capsid to display RGD and poly-lysine motifs in the fiber knob. Safety and antitumor effect of this gene therapy platform was demonstrated using interleukin-12 as a therapeutic gene. In conclusion, we have developed a new tool that allows local, sustained and controlled production of therapeutic proteins in tumors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common types of malignancy. Semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F) is highly conserved but present at a lower level in various cancers than in healthy tissues. While it has been reported that SEMA3F is involved in cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, its function in OSCC remains unknown. Methods: The expression of SEMA3F in OSCC tissues and OSCC-derived cells was analyzed using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Using SAS and HSC2 cells, we also monitored the effect of SEMA3F on OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion using MTT, colony formation and transwell assays. The function of SEMA3F in OSCC tumor formation was also assessed in vivo. Results: SEMA3F was significantly downregulated in OSCC tissues and OSCC-derived cells. SEMA3F shows growth inhibitory activity in SAS and HSC2 cells and may act as a tumor suppressor. It can inhibit the migration and invasion potential of OSCC cells. Our results also demonstrate that SEMA3F can suppress the growth of OSCC cells in vivo. Conclusions: This study revealed that SEMA3F plays a role as a tumor suppressor in OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Our finding provides new insight into the progression of OSCC. Therapeutically, SEMA3F has some potential as a target for OSCC treatment, given sufficient future research. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AIM To characterize the survival of cirrhotic patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to ascertain the factors predicting the achievement of disease control (DC). METHODS The cirrhotic patients with BCLC stage C HCC evaluated by the Hepatocatt multidisciplinary group were subjected to the investigation. Demographic, clinical and tumor features, along with the best tumor response and overall survival were recorded. RESULTS One hundred and ten BCLC stage C patients were included in the analysis; the median overall survival was 13.4 mo (95%CI: 10.6-17.0). Only alphafetoprotein (AFP) serum level > 200 ng/mL and DC could independently predict survival but in a time dependent manner, the former was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality within the first 6 mo of follow-up (HR = 5.073, 95%CI: 2.159-11.916, P = 0.0002), whereas the latter showed a protective effect against death after one year (HR = 0.110, 95%CI: 0.038-0.314, P < 0.0001). Only patients showing microvascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread recorded lower chances of achieving DC (OR = 0.263, 95%CI: 0.111-0.622, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION The BCLC stage C HCC includes a wide heterogeneous group of cirrhotic patients suitable for potentially curative treatments. The reverse and time dependent effect of AFP serum level and DC on patients' survival confers them as useful predictive tools for treatment management and clinical decisions. © The Author(s) 2017.",

The relationship between Ang-2 and head neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC) remains uncleaar. This meta-analysis was to explore the association between expression of Ang-2 and HNSCC. METHODS Databases as PubMed,EMBASE,Cocharance Library,Chinese Biomedical Literature Database(CBM),China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI),VIP and WangFang Data were electronically searched from the inception to April 2017 to collect case-control studies published about the association between Ang-2 expression and clinical pathogenic features in HNSCC. Two reviewers screened literatures,extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies independently. RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform meta-analysis. RESULTS Eleven case-control studies with 639 HNSCC cases and 168 controls were included. According to our results,the expression of Ang-2 in HNSCC tissue was higher than in formal control(OR=6.68,95%CI:4.43-10.08). In additon,the Ang-2 expression was positively correlate with lymph node metastasis(OR=2.29,95%CI:1.50-3.48),and tumor stage(OR=0.42,95%CI:0.21-0.86), but seems to have no significant impact on tumor differentiation(OR=0.62,95%CI:0.28-1.40). CONCLUSIONS Current results demonstrate that Ang-2 could regulate the angiogenesis which may influence the occurrence,invasion and metastasis of HNSCC and may be corrected with tumor malignance. It may correlate with poor prognosis for patients with HNSCC. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment. All right reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To detect the differential expression profile of miRNAs (microRNAs) in crude drugs and processed products of Lycopodiastrum casuarinoides and identify potential bioactive herbal-derived miRNAs. Methods: The samples of the whole aerial tissues (including stems, leaves, branches) were collected in Yichun area of Jiangxi Province and were authenticated by relevant experts. General RNA was extracted from the crude drugs and processed products of L. casuarinoides, respectively. High-qualified small RNAs (sRNA) were isolated to be constructed the sRNA sequencing library. Then, the single-ended sequencing was conducted by using Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 sequencing method. MiRNA characteristic of L. casuarinoides was analyzed by relevant bioinformatics. Results: 9 898 332 and 10 099 918 clean reads were obtained from crude drugs group and processed products group, respectively. A total of 25 microRNAs were differentially expressed between crude drugs group and processed products groups with statistical significance, among which 22 were up regulated and three were down-regulated in processed products group compared to those in the crude drugs group. GO (gene ontology) analysis showed that their homo sapiens targets were enriched in catalytic binding, molecular transducer and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) analysis was shown for the target genes enriched in cancer and immunity-related pathways, such as pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer. Conclusion: The differential expression profile of microRNAs is first revealed by two processing forms of L. casuarinoides. This study suggests that the crude drugs and processed products miRNAs identified in this study will lay a foundation for exploring the pharmaceutical function of miRNAs in L. casuarinoides. © 2017, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

    "Abstract": "SHP2, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase encoded by the PTPN11 gene, is involved in multiple cell signaling processes including Ras/MAPK and Hippo/YAP pathways. SHP2 has been shown to contribute to the progression of a number of cancer types including leukemia, gastric, and breast cancers. It also regulates T-cell activation by interacting with inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors such as the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). Thus, SHP2 inhibitors have drawn great attention by both inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and activating T cell immune responses toward cancer cells. In this study, we report the identification of an allosteric SHP2 inhibitor 1-(4-(6-bromonaphthalen-2-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-4-methylpiperidin-4-amine (23) that locks SHP2 in a closed conformation by binding to the interface of the N-terminal SH2, C-terminal SH2, and phosphatase domains. Compound 23 suppresses MAPK signaling pathway and YAP transcriptional activity and shows antitumor activity in vivo.

    "Abstract": "AIM To critically evaluate previous scientific evidence on Fusobacterium’s role in colorectal neoplasia development. METHODS Two independent investigators systematically reviewed all original scientific articles published between January, 2000, and July, 2017, using PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE. A total of 355 articles were screened at the abstract level. Of these, only original scientific human, animal, and in vitro studies investigating Fusobacterium and its relationship with colorectal cancer (CRC) were included in the analysis. Abstracts, review articles, studies investigating other colonic diseases, and studies written in other languages than English were excluded from our analysis. Ninety articles were included after removing duplicates, resolving disagreements between the two reviewers, and applying the above criteria. RESULTS Studies have consistently identified positive associations between Fusobacterium , especially Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum ), and CRC. Stronger associations were seen in CRCs proximal to the splenic flexure and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-high CRCs. There was evidence of temporality and a biological gradient, with increased F. nucleatum DNA detection and quantity along the traditional adenoma-carcinoma sequence and in CIMP-high CRC precursors. Diet may have a differential impact on colonic F. nucleatum enrichment; evidence suggests that high fiber diet may reduce the risk of a subset of CRCs that are F. nucleatum DNA-positive. Data also suggest shorter CRC and disease-specific survival with increased amount of F. nucleatum DNA in CRC tissue. The pathophysiology of enrichment of F. nucleatum and other Fusobacterium species in colonic tissue is unclear; however, the virulence factors and changes to the local colonic environment with disruption of the protective mucus layer may contribute. The presence of a host lectin (Gal-GalNAc) in the colonic epithelium may also mediate F. nucleatum attachment to CRC and precursors through interaction with an F. nucleatum protein, fibroblast activation protein 2 (FAP2). The clinical significance of detection or enrichment of Fusobacterium in colorectal neoplasia is ambiguous, but data suggest a procarcinogenic effect of F. nucleatum , likely due to activation of oncogenic and inflammatory pathways and modulation of the tumor immune environment. This is hypothesized to be mediated by certain F. nucleatum strains carrying invasive properties and virulence factors such as FadA and FAP. CONCLUSION Evidence suggests a potential active role of Fusobacterium , specifically F. nucleatum , in CRC. Future prospective and experimental human studies would fill an important gap in this literature. © The Author(s) 2017. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Malignant proliferation and metastasis in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are great challenges for effective clinical treatment through conventional chemotherapy. The combinational therapy strategy of RNA interfering (RNAi) technology and chemotherapeutic agents have been reported to be promising for effective cancer therapy. In this study, based on multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs), the simultaneous delivery of etoposide (ETP) and anti-Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2 (EZH2) siRNA for the effective treatment of orthotopic lung tumor was achieved. The NPs exhibited pH/redox dual sensitivity verified by particle size changes, morphological changes, and in vitro release of drugs. Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that the NPs exhibited endosomal escape property and on-demand intracellular drug release behavior, which can protect siRNA from degradation and facilitate the chemotherapeutic effect respectively. In vitro tumor cell motility study demonstrated that EZH2 siRNA loaded in NPs can decrease the migration and invasion capabilities of tumor cells by downregulating the expression of EZH2 mRNA and protein. In particular, an antiproliferation study revealed that the co-delivery of siRNA and ETP in the multifunctional NPs can induce a synergistic therapeutic effect on NSCLC. In vivo targeting evaluation showed that cRGDyC-PEG modification on NPs exhibited a low distribution in normal organs and an obvious accumulation in orthotopic lung tumor. Furthermore, targeted NPs co-delivering siRNA and ETP showed superior inhibition on tumor growth and metastasis and produced minimal systemic toxicity. These findings indicated that multifunctional NPs can be utilized as a co-delivery system, and that the combination of EZH2 siRNA and ETP can effectively treat NSCLC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30–100 nm in diameter) secreted by cells into extracellular space. The present study evaluated the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on exosome production and/or release, and quantified the contribution of exosomes to intercellular drug transfer and pharmacodynamics. Methods Human cancer cells (breast MCF7, breast-to-lung metastatic LM2, ovarian A2780 and OVCAR4) were treated with paclitaxel (PTX, 2–1000 nM) or doxorubicin (DOX, 20–1000 nM) for 24–48 h. Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of drug-treated donor cells (Donor cells) using ultra-centrifugation, and analyzed for acetylcholinesterase activity, total proteins, drug concentrations, and biological effects (cytotoxicity and anti-migration) on drug-naïve recipient cells (Recipient cells). These results were used to develop computational predictive quantitative pharmacology models. Results Cells in exponential growth phase released ~ 220 exosomes/cell in culture medium. PTX and DOX significantly promoted exosome production and/or release in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with greater effects in ovarian cancer cells than in breast cancer cells. Exosomes isolated from Donor cells contained appreciable drug levels (2–7 pmole/106 cells after 24 h treatment with 100–1000 nM PTX), and caused cytotoxicity and inhibited migration of Recipient cells. Quantitative pharmacology models that integrated cellular PTX pharmacokinetics with PTX pharmacodynamics successfully predicted effects of exosomes on intercellular drug transfer, cytotoxicity of PTX on Donor cells and cytotoxicity of PTX-containing exosomes on Recipient cells. Additional model simulations indicate that within clinically achievable PTX concentrations, the contribution of exosomes to active drug efflux increased with drug concentration and exceeded the p-glycoprotein efflux when the latter was saturated. Conclusions Our results indicate (a) chemotherapeutic agents stimulate exosome production or release, and (b) exosome is a mechanism of intercellular drug transfer that contributes to pharmacodynamics of neighboring cells. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Although we have shown earlier that aldose reductase (AR) inhibitors prevent colorectal cancer cell (CRC) growth in culture as well as in nude mice xenografts, the mechanism(s) is not well understood. In this study, we have investigated how AR inhibition prevents CRC growth by regulating the mitochondrial biogenesis via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Incubation of CRC cells such as SW-480, HT29, and HCT116 with AR inhibitor, fidarestat that non-covalently binds to the enzyme, increases the expression of Nrf2. Further, fidarestat augmented the EGF-induced expression of Nrf2 in CRC cells. Fidarestat also increased the Nrf2 -DNA binding activity as well as expression of HO-1 and NQO1 and activation of SOD and catalase in SW480 cells. Similarly, in nude mice xenograft tumor tissues, Nrf2 and HO-1 levels were significantly higher in fidarestat-treated mice compared to controls. Further, stimulation of CRC cells with EGF in the presence of fidarestat increased the mRNA levels of PGC-1α, Nrf1 and TFAM and protein levels of PGC-1α, TFAM and COX-IV and decreased the mitochondrial DNA damage as measured by 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine levels. AR inhibitor also modulated the phosphorylations of AMPK and mTOR and expression of p53 in EGF-treated cells. Collectively, our results indicate that AR inhibitor prevents CRC growth by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis via increasing the expression of Nrf2/HO-1/AMPK/p53 and decreasing the mitochondrial DNA damage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and the fastest growing malignancy in the United States. With a 5-year survival rate below 12%, effective therapies for HCC are needed. Current treatments for HCC include microwave and radiofrequency ablation, high intensity focused ultrasound, liver transplant, surgical resection, and localized embolizations. However, each of these approaches has some limitation, making it imperative to develop improved methods for sensitizing tumors prior to therapy. We hypothesized that the use of ultrasound-triggered microbubble destruction (UTMD), which sensitizes tumors to radiotherapy by inducing vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, will selectively sensitize malignant tissue to radiotherapy and improve outcomes. To test this, 18 nude rats were inoculated in the right liver lobe with Hu7.5 HCC cells and after tumor formation, received 5 Gy radiotherapy, UTMD, or UTMD prior to radiotherapy. Compared to radiotherapy alone, there was a 170% reduction in tumor growth 7 days post treatment and a 3.2X improvement in median survival time when radiotherapy was combined with UTMD. These results indicate that UTMD is an effective adjunct when combined with radiotherapy to treat HCC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Fatty acid synthase (FASN), the major enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis, is highly expressed in breast cancer and its expression is reduced by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in liver. We previously found a positive association between rat mammary tumor levels of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) and tumor weight. We examined the roles of the major n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the major n-6 PUFA, AA, in FASN expression in, and proliferation of, human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Methods: The cells were treated for 48 h with BSA or 60 μM BSA-bound DHA, AA, or oleic acid (OA, 18:1n-9), then were incubated with or without estradiol or insulin. Western blot and 3H-thymidine incorporation assay were used to determine the role of DHA on FASN regulation and MCF-7 cell proliferation. Results: DHA, but neither AA nor OA, inhibits estradiol-induced and insulin-induced expression of the precursor of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (p-SREBP-1), its mature form (m-SREBP-1), and FASN. Estradiol or insulin stimulation increased the pAkt/Akt and pS6/S6 ratios, expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN, and cell proliferation, and these effects were decreased by DHA. The DHA-induced decrease in FASN expression resulted from reduced pAkt/Akt signaling and not pERK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, DHA enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on pAkt signaling and expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN. However, addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathways, 1 h before addition of estradiol or insulin increased the pAkt/Akt ratio and FASN expression, and this effect was inhibited by addition of DHA 48 h before rapamycin. Conclusion: We conclude that, in MCF-7 cells, DHA inhibits pAKT signaling and thus expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN and cell proliferation. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Associations between polymorphisms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) or efflux transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein and MRP2) and different types of cancer have been described, whereas the role of influx transporters (e.g. OATP1B1 and OATP2B1) has been seldom explored. The GenColon study investigated potential associations between variant alleles of UGTs, efflux and influx transporters and CRC. Methods: Three hundred CRC cases were matched with 300 controls for age, sex and enrolment site. Fifteen SNPs in UGT1A6-9, UGT2B7, ABCB1, ABCC2, SLCO1B1 and SLCO2B1 genes were characterized using Taqman® PCR. Using multivariate conditional logistic regression, we investigated the relationships between CRC and \"environmental\" risk factors (physical activity, housing and working areas, consumption of red meat, tobacco, alcohol); genetic polymorphisms, in the study population and in the subgroups with \"environmental\" risk factors. Results: No significant association was observed for the analyzed SNPs (or haplotypes). However, an increased CRC risk was found in carriers of the UGT1A8 rs1042597-G variant allele (additive risk OR = 3.39[1.29-8.89], p = 0.02951) in the subgroup of meat-consumers (n = 84), and in carriers of the ABCB1 rs1045642-T (exon26) variant allele (additive risk; OR = 1.89[1.10-3.39], p = 0.0257) in the \"never alcohol consumption subgroup\" (n = 125). In addition, as previously reported, the following CRC risk factors were identified: absence of physical activity (OR = 6.35[3.70-10.9], p < 0.0001), living or working in rural or mix area (OR = 2.50[1.48-4.23], p = 0.0006 and OR = 2.99[1.63-5.48], p = 0.004, respectively) and tobacco exposure >30 years (3.37[1.63-6.96], p = 0.0010). Conclusions: Variant genotypes of influx transporters (OATP1B1 and 2B1) were not associated with CRC. This study confirmed the influence of lifestyle factors, but not the previously reported detrimental effect of SNPs in intestinal UGTs or efflux transporters, except for a UGT1A8 variant in subjects consuming meat and the exon 26 SNP of ABCB1 in the never alcohol consumption subgroup.

    "Abstract": "A nanoplatform for simultaneous cellular imaging, and photodynamic and photothermal therapies has been designed and realized by embedding a purposely synthesized highly luminescent water soluble iridium(iii) compound into gold core-silica shell nanoparticles. These multifunctionalities arise mainly from the photophysical properties of the cyclometalated complex: (i) the heavy atom promotes, through excited triplet state formation, energy transfer processes towards molecular oxygen, with the generation of 1O2 (photodynamic effect); (ii) the overlap of the iridium(iii) complex emission band with the plasmonic resonance of gold nanostructures allows excitation energy transfer towards the metallic core (photothermal effect); (iii) the remarkable iridium(iii) complex luminescence feature, which is preserved despite energy transfer processes, makes the whole system an efficient luminescent bio-probe (imaging). Photophysical and photothermal investigations have been carried out, whereas in vitro photo-cytotoxicity tests have been performed on human glioblastoma cells (U87MG), highlighting significant cancer cell death at a very low photosensitizer concentration (&lt;0.5 μM), by means of a synergistic photodynamic and photothermal effect. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Sessile serrated adenomas/polyps are distinguished from hyperplastic colonic polyps subjectively by their endoscopic appearance and histological morphology. However, hyperplastic and sessile serrated polyps can have overlapping morphological features resulting in sessile serrated polyps diagnosed as hyperplastic. While sessile serrated polyps can progress into colon cancer, hyperplastic polyps have virtually no risk for colon cancer. Objective measures, differentiating these types of polyps would improve cancer prevention and treatment outcome. Methods: RNA-seq training data set and Affimetrix, Illumina testing data sets were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). RNA-seq single-end reads were filtered with FastX toolkit. Read mapping to the human genome, gene abundance estimation, and differential expression analysis were performed with Tophat-Cufflinks pipeline. Background correction, normalization, and probe summarization steps for Affimetrix arrays were performed using the robust multi-array method (RMA). For Illumina arrays, log2-scale expression data was obtained from GEO. Pathway analysis was implemented using Bioconductor package GSAR. To build a platform-independent molecular classifier that accurately differentiates sessile serrated and hyperplastic polyps we developed a new feature selection step. We also developed a simple procedure to classify new samples as either sessile serrated or hyperplastic with a class probability assigned to the decision, estimated using Cantelli's inequality. Results: The classifier trained on RNA-seq data and tested on two independent microarray data sets resulted in zero and three errors. The classifier was further tested using quantitative real-time PCR expression levels of 45 blinded independent formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens and was highly accurate. Pathway analyses have shown that sessile serrated polyps are distinguished from hyperplastic polyps and normal controls by: up-regulation of pathways implicated in proliferation, inflammation, cell-cell adhesion and down-regulation of serine threonine kinase signaling pathway; differential co-expression of pathways regulating cell division, protein trafficking and kinase activities. Conclusions: Most of the differentially expressed pathways are known as hallmarks of cancer and likely to explain why sessile serrated polyps are more prone to neoplastic transformation than hyperplastic. The new molecular classifier includes 13 genes and may facilitate objective differentiation between two polyps. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and malignant brain tumor with a high mortality rate. The presence of a large population of macrophages (Mφ) in the tumor microenvironment is a prominent feature of GBM and these so-called tumor-associated Mφ (TAM) closely interact with the GBM cells to promote the survival, progression and therapy resistance of the GBM. Various therapeutic strategies have been devised either targeting the GBM cells or the TAM but few have addressed the cross-talks between the two cell populations. The present study was carried out to explore the possibility of exploiting the cross-talks between the GBM cells (GC) and TAM for modulation of the GBM microenvironment through using Nano-DOX, a drug composite based on nanodiamonds bearing doxorubicin. In the in vitro work on human cell models, Nano-DOX-loaded TAM were first shown to be viable and able to infiltrate three-dimensional GC spheroids and release cargo drug therein. GC were then demonstrated to encourage Nano-DOX-loaded TAM to unload Nano-DOX back into GC which consequently emitted damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are powerful immunostimulatory agents as well as indicators of cell damage. Nano-DOX was next proven to be a more potent inducer of GC DAMPs emission than doxorubicin. As a result, Nano-DOX-damaged GC exhibited an enhanced ability to attract both TAM and Nano-DOX-loaded TAM. Most remarkably, Nano-DOX-damaged GC reprogrammed the TAM from a pro-GBM phenotype to an anti-GBM phenotype that suppressed GC growth. Finally, the in vivo relevance of the in vitro findings was tested in animal study. Mice bearing orthotopic human GBM xenografts were intravenously injected with Nano-DOX-loaded mouse TAM which were found releasing drug in the GBM xenografts 24 h after injection. GC damage was evidenced by the induction of DAMPs emission within the xenografts and a shift of TAM phenotype was detected as well. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel way with therapeutic potential to harness the cross-talk between GBM cells and TAM for modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Presence of Met receptor tyrosine kinase in the nucleus of cells has been reported. However, the functions of Met which expresses in the nucleus (nMet) remain elusive. In this study, we found that nMet was increased in 89% of HCC tumorous tissues when compared with the corresponding non-tumorous liver tissues. nMet expression increased progressively along HCC development and significantly correlated with cirrhosis, poorer cellular differentiation, venous invasion, late stage HCC and poorer overall survival. Western blot analysis revealed that nMet is a 48-kDa protein comprising the carboxyl terminal of Met receptor. Induced expression of nMet promoted HCC cell growth, migration and invasiveness in vitro and tumorigenesis and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Luciferase assay showed that nMet activated NF-κB pathway. Indeed, p-IKKα/β and nuclear p-p65 were higher in nMet stable cells than in the control cells. Perturbation of TAK1/NF-κB axis abrogated the aggressiveness of HCC cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, nMet was overexpressed and as a potential prognostic biomarker of HCC. Functionally, nMet accelerated HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis via the activation of TAK1/NF-κB pathway. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "De-novo malignancies carry an incidence ranging between 3%-26% after transplant and account for the second highest cause of post-transplant mortality behind cardiovascular disease. While the majority of de-novo malignancies after transplant usually consist of skin cancers, there has been an increasing rate of solid tumor cancers over the last 15 years. Although, recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is well understood among patients transplanted for HCC, there are increasing reports of de-novo HCC in those transplanted for a non-HCC indication. The proposed pathophysiology for these cases has been mainly connected to the presence of advanced graft fibrosis or cirrhosis and always associated with the presence of hepatitis B or C virus. We report the first known case of de-novo HCC in a recipient, 14 years after a pediatric living related donor liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease due to biliary atresia without the presence of hepatitis B or C virus before and after transplant. We present this case report to increase the awareness of this phenomenon and address on the utility for screening and surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma among these individuals. One recommendation is to use similar guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and treatment for HCC as those used for primary HCC in the pre-transplant patient, focusing on those recipients who have advanced fibrosis in the allograft, regardless of etiology. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To assess the cleansing efficacy and safety of a new Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) bowel preparation regimen. METHODS This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing two CCE regimens. Subjects were asymptomatic and average risk for colorectal cancer. The second generation CCE system (PillCam® COLON 2; Medtronic, Yoqneam, Israel) was utilized. Preparation regimens differed in the 1st and 2nd boosts with the Study regimen using oral sulfate solution (89 mL) with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution (“diatrizoate solution”) (boost 1 = 60 mL, boost 2 = 30 mL) and the Control regimen oral sulfate solution (89 mL) alone. The primary outcome was overall and segmental colon cleansing. Secondary outcomes included safety, polyp detection, colonic transit, CCE completion and capsule excretion = 12 h. RESULTS Both regimens had similar cleansing efficacy for the whole colon (Adequate: Study = 75.9%, Control = 77.3%; P = 0.88) and individual segments. In the Study group, CCE completion was superior (Study = 90.9%, Control = 76.9%; P = 0.048) and colonic transit was more often &lt; 40 min (Study = 21.8%, Control = 4%; P = 0.0073). More Study regimen subjects experienced adverse events (Study = 19.4%, Control = 3.4%; P = 0.0061), and this difference did not appear related to diatrizoate solution. Adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal in nature and no serious adverse events related either to the bowel preparation regimen or the capsule were observed. There was a trend toward higher polyp detection with the Study regimen, but this did not achieve statistical significance for any size category. Mean transit time through the entire gastrointestinal tract, from ingestion to excretion, was shorter with the Study regimen while mean colonic transit times were similar for both study groups. CONCLUSION A CCE bowel preparation regimen using oral sulfate solution and diatrizoate solution as a boost agent is effective, safe, and achieved superior CCE completion. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Our laboratory has the fundamental responsibility to study cancer stem cells (CSC) in various models of human and animal neoplasms. However, the major impediments that spike our accomplishment are the lack of universal biomarkers and cellular heterogeneity. To cope with these restrictions, we have tried to apply the concept of single cell analysis, which has hitherto been recommended throughout the world as an imperative solution pack for resolving such dilemmas. Accordingly, our first step was to utilize a predesigned spiral microchannel fabricated by our laboratory to perform size-based single cell separation using mast cell tumor (MCT) cells as a model. However, the impact of hydrodynamic shear stresses (HSS) on mechanical cell injury and viability in a spiral microchannel has not been fully investigated so far. Intuitively, our computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has strongly revealed the formations of fluid shear stress (FSS) and extensional fluid stress (EFS) in the sorting system. The panel of biomedical assays has also disclosed cell degeneration and necrosis in the model. Therefore, we have herein reported the combinatorically detrimental effect of FSS and EFS on the viability of MCT cells after sorting in our spiral microchannel, with discussion on the possibly pathogenic mechanisms of HSS-induced cell injury in the study model. © 2017 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Programmed ligand targeting strategy promotes the blood circulation stability of nanoparticles by shielding the ligand. However, the irreversible shielding causes the deshielded nanoparticles to be easily recognized and cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), impeding their further retention in the tumor. Here, we for the first time prove the superiority of the intelligent re-shieldable targeting system that is based on the pH-responsive self-assembly/disassembly of gold nanoparticles. The system can enhance the stability of gold nanoparticles in the blood circulation (2.6-fold at 24 h), reduce uptake by the RES (35% lower) and improve tumor accumulation (41% higher by analysis of gold content in tumor) effectively compared with the conventional irreversible system. Furthermore, preliminary study indicates that the system could be applied as computed tomography contrast agent in tumor imaging. The in vivo validity of the intelligent re-shieldable targeting system provides inspiration for the design of nanomaterials for cancer diagnosis and treatment. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC) vaccine–based immunotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has shown apparent benefit in animal experiments and early-phase clinical trials, but the survival benefit is variable. In this work, we analyzed the mechanism of the potent antitumor immune response induced in vivo by tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific DCs with an invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell adjuvant in orthotopic glioblastoma-bearing rats vaccinated with tumor-derived exosomes and α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) -pulsed DCs. Compared with traditional tumor lysate, exosomes were utilized as a more potent antigen to load DCs. iNKT cells, as an effective cellular adjuvant activated by α-GalCer, strengthened TAA presentation through their interaction with DCs. Co-delivery of tumor-derived exosomes with α-GalCer on a DC-based vaccine showed powerful effects in glioblastoma immunotherapy. This vaccine induced strong activation and proliferation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, synergistically breaking the immune tolerance and improving the immunosuppressive environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this work is to validate the Dynamic Planning Module in terms of usability and acceptance in the treatment planning workflow. Methods: The Dynamic Planning Module was used for decision making whether a plan adaptation was necessary within one course of radiation therapy. The Module was also used for patients scheduled for re-irradiation to estimate the dose in the pretreated region and calculate the accumulated dose to critical organs at risk. During one year, 370 patients were scheduled for plan adaptation or re-irradiation. All patient cases were classified according to their treated body region. For a sub-group of 20 patients treated with RT for lung cancer, the dosimetric effect of plan adaptation during the main treatment course was evaluated in detail. Changes in tumor volume, frequency of re-planning and the time interval between treatment start and plan adaptation were assessed. Results: The Dynamic Planning Tool was used in 20% of treated patients per year for both approaches nearly equally (42% plan adaptation and 58% re-irradiation). Most cases were assessed for the thoracic body region (51%) followed by pelvis (21%) and head and neck cases (10%). The sub-group evaluation showed that unintended plan adaptation was performed in 38% of the scheduled cases. A median time span between first day of treatment and necessity of adaptation of 17 days (range 4-35 days) was observed. PTV changed by 12 ± 12% on average (maximum change 42%). PTV decreased in 18 of 20 cases due to tumor shrinkage and increased in 2 of 20 cases. Re-planning resulted in a reduction of the mean lung dose of the ipsilateral side in 15 of 20 cases. Conclusion: The experience of one year showed high acceptance of the Dynamic Planning Module in our department for both physicians and medical physicists. The re-planning can potentially reduce the accumulated dose to the organs at risk and ensure a better target volume coverage. In the re-irradiation situation, the Dynamic Planning Tool was used to consider the pretreatment dose, to adapt the actual treatment schema more specifically and to review the accumulated dose. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: No consensus treatment has been reached for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Hepatic resection (HR) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) have been recommended as effective options, but which is better remains unclear. This meta-analysis is to compare the effectiveness of HR and TACE for HCC with PVTT patients. Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, VIP, Wan Fang, and Sino Med databases were systematically searched for comparing HR and TACE treating PVTT. Results: Twelve retrospective studies with 3129 patients were included. A meta-analysis of 11 studies suggested that the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.41-0.57, I 2 = 37%, P &lt; 0.00001; OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.12-0.38, I 2 = 43%, P &lt; 0.00001; OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.28-0.44, I 2 = 53%, P &lt; 0.00001; OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.14-0.54, I 2 = 72%, P = 0.0001, respectively) favored HR over TACE. In a subgroup analysis, HR had better 1-, 2-,3, 5-year OS for type I PVTT (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.17-0.64, I 2 = 20%, P = 0.001; OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.16-0.63, I2 = 0%, P = 0.001; OR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09-0.36, I2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.00001; OR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.01-0.32, I2 = 0%, P = 0.0006, respectively) and better 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS for type II PVTT (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.20-0.70, I 2 = 59%, P = 0.002; OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.13-0.39, I 2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.00001; OR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.03-0.91; I 2 = 51%, P = 0.04, respectively). There was no difference in 1-, 3-, or 5-year OS between HR and TACE for type III PVTT (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.61-1.21, I 2 = 0%, P = 0.39; OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.42-1.64, I 2 = 0%, P = 0.59; OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.06--6.04, I 2 = 65%, P = 0.66, respectively). Conclusions: HR may lead to longer OS for some selected HCC patients with PVTT than TACE, especially for type I or II PVTT, with less difference being observed for type III or IV PVTT. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Tumor vascular endothelium and extracellular matrix (ECM) as the major barriers of anticancer nanomedicine greatly limited the anticancer efficacy of treatment, but few strategies were available to overcome them simultaneously. Thus, herein a strategy was presented to utilize reversible vasodilatation effect of nitric oxide (NO) and size-controlled characteristic of ultrasound responsive liposome (URL) to construct a non-destructive nanomedicine, which was able to cross both obstacles simultaneously. In this work, URL was built as a carrier via forming a gas layer between lipid bilayer to encapsulate small particles PAMAM@DOX (PD, ~ 10 nm) and NO donation-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Under ultrasound (US) stimulation, GSNO fastly generated NO that acting on tumor vascular smooth muscle, resulting in tumor vascular vasodilatation, meanwhile the URL lipid bilayer was destroyed, leading to release sharply of small nanoparticles PD. Combination vasodilatory effect of NO and size-controlled characteristic of URL allowed vast drugs to extravasate through endothelial gap and penetrate into tumor deep. Upon different types of cancers vary greatly in vascular structure, two distinctly different tumor, MCF-7 human breast carcinoma and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma, were chosen to test the anticancer efficacy of URL. As a result, URL-based nanosystem was significantly more effective than the conventional liposome (CL) in tumor treatment, particularly in much less leaky MiaPaCa-2 tumor treatment (tumor therapeutic efficiency of URL/PD/GSNO + US increased by 32.5% and 56.5% compared to CL/DOX in MCF-7 and MiaPaCa-2 tumor treatment). This study offers a new method to enhance tumor drug accumulation along with minimal toxicity for future clinical cancer treatments. © 2017",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND In a phase 1 trial, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, showed efficacy in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma after the failure of conventional therapy. METHODS In this multicenter, phase 2 trial, we enrolled 111 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, or transformed follicular lymphoma who had refractory disease despite undergoing recommended prior therapy. Patients received a target dose of 2×106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight after receiving a conditioning regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. The primary end point was the rate of objective response (calculated as the combined rates of complete response and partial response). Secondary end points included overall survival, safety, and biomarker assessments. RESULTS Among the 111 patients who were enrolled, axi-cel was successfully manufactured for 110 (99%) and administered to 101 (91%). The objective response rate was 82%, and the complete response rate was 54%.With a median follow-up of 15.4 months, 42% of the patients continued to have a response, with 40% continuing to have a complete response. The overall rate of survival at 18 months was 52%. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher during treatment were neutropenia (in 78% of the patients), anemia (in 43%), and thrombocytopenia (in 38%). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 13% and 28% of the patients, respectively. Three of the patients died during treatment. Higher CAR T-cell levels in blood were associated with response. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter study, patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma who received CAR T-cell therapy with axi-cel had high levels of durable response, with a safety profile that included myelosuppression, the cytokine release syndrome, and neurologic events. © 2017 Massachusetts Medical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: A wide range of studies has investigated the diagnostic proficiency of extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in hepatocellular cancer (HCC). HCC is expected to increase in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), due to endemic levels of viral infection (HBV/HIV), ageing and changing lifestyles. This unique aetiological background provides an opportunity for investigating potentially novel circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for HCC in a prospective study in South Africa. Methods: This study will recruit HCC patients from two South African cancer hospitals, situated in Durban and Pietermaritzburg in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. These cases will include both HBV mono-infected and HBV/HIV co-infected HCC cases. The control group will consist of two (2) age and sex-matched healthy population controls per HCC case randomly selected from a Durban based laboratory. The controls will exclude patients if they have any evidence of chronic liver disease. A standardised reporting approach will be adopted to detect, quantify and normalize the level of circulating miRNAs in the blood sera of HCC cases and their controls. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) will be employed to quantity extracellular miRNAs. Differences in concentration of relevant miRNA by case/control status will be assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney U) test. Adjustment for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction), receiver operating curves (ROC) and optimal breakpoint analyses will be employed to identify potential thresholds for the differentiation of miRNA levels of HCC cases and their controls. Discussion: Although there is a growing base of literature regarding the role of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers, this promising field remains a 'work in progress'. The aetiology of HBV infection in HCC is well understood, as well as it's role in miRNA deregulation, however, the mediating role of HIV infection is unknown. HCC incidence in SSA, including South Africa, is expected to increase significantly in the next decade. A combination of factors, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to identify candidate circulating miRNAs as potential biomarkers for HBV/HIV infected HCC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Golgi Membrane Protein 1 (GOLM1), a protein involved in the trafficking of proteins through the Golgi apparatus, has been shown to be oncogenic in a variety of human cancers. Here, we examined the role of GOLM1 in the development of human glioma. Methods: qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis were performed to evaluate GOLM1 levels in cell lines and a cohort of primary human glioma and non-neoplastic brain tissue samples. Glioma cell lines were modified with lentiviral constructs expressing short hairpin RNAs targeting GOLM1 or overexpressing the protein to assess function in proliferation, viability, and migration and invasion in vitro using EdU, CCK8, clone-forming, Transwell assays, 3D tumor spheroid invasion assay and in vivo in orthotopic implantations. Protein lysates were used to screen a membrane-based antibody array to identify kinases mediated by GOLM1. Specific inhibitors of PDGFRα (AG1296) and AKT (MK-2206) were used to examine the regulation of PDGFA/PDGFRα on GOLM1 and the underlying pathway respectively. Results: qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis revealed GOLM1 expression to be elevated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Silencing of GOLM1 attenuated proliferation, migration, and invasion of U251, A172 and P3#GBM (primary glioma) cells, while overexpression of GOLM1 enhanced malignant behavior of U87MG cells. We further demonstrated that activation of AKT is the driving force of GOLM1-promoted glioma progression. The last finding of this research belongs to the regulation of PDGFA/PDGFRα on GOLM1, while GOLM1 was also a key element of PDGFA/PDGFRα-mediated activation of AKT, as well as the progression of glioma cells. Conclusions: PDGFA/PDGFRα-regulated GOLM1 promotes glioma progression possibly through activation of a key signaling kinase, AKT.

    "Abstract": "Background: This meta-analysis aims to compare the diagnostic performance of l-3-18F-α-methyl tyrosine (18F-FAMT) positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) PET for malignancy detection. Methods: The workflow of this study follows Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines of a systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy studies. An electronic search was performed for clinical diagnostic studies directly comparing 18F-FAMT and 18F-FDG PET for malignant tumors. Study quality, the risks of bias and sources of variation among studies were assessed using the QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) assessment tool. A separate meta-analysis was performed for diagnostic performance based on visual assessment and diagnostic cut-off values. Whenever possible, a bivariate random-effect model was used for analysis and pooling of diagnostic measures across studies. Results: Electronic search revealed 56 peer-reviewed basic science investigations and clinical studies. Six eligible studies (272 patients) of various type of cancer were meta-analyzed. The 18F-FAMT diagnostic accuracy for malignancy was higher than 18F-FDG based on both visual assessment (diagnostic odd ratio (DOR): 8.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.4, 32.5]) vs 4.63, 95% CI [1.8, 12.2], area under curve (AUC): 77.4% vs 72.8%) and diagnostic cut-off (DOR: 13.83, 95% CI [6.3, 30.6] vs 7.85, 95% CI [3.7, 16.8], AUC: 85.6% vs 80.2%), respectively. While the average sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FAMT and 18F-FDG based on visual assessment were similar, 18F-FAMT was significantly more specific than 18F-FDG (p &lt; 0.05) based on diagnostic cut-off values. Conclusions:18F-FAMT is more specific for malignancy than 18F-FDG, while their sensitivity is comparable. 18F-FAMT PET is equal to 18F-FDG PET in diagnostic performance for malignancy detection in several cancer types. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. Previous studies reported that TP53 mutations correlated with poor prognoses in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the relationship between TP53 mutations and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) is not known. The current study aimed to evaluate TP53 mutation status as a predictive biomarker in patients with HPSCC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of 57 HPSCC patients treated with initial surgery between 2008 and 2014. TP53 mutation status was determined by Sanger sequencing, and patients were classified into wild-type, missense mutation, and truncating mutation groups. Additionally, p53 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry in surgical specimens. Results: TP53 mutations were identified in 39 (68%) patients. The 3-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rate of wild-type, missense mutation, and truncating mutation group were 94%, 61%, and 43%, respectively. The TP53 mutation group displayed significantly worse DSS and overall survival rates than the wild-type group (P = 0.01 and P = 0.007, respectively). Multivariate analyses revealed that the presence of TP53 mutations and ≥4 metastatic lymph nodes were independent adverse prognostic factors for HPSCC. p53 immunopositivity was detected in 22 patients, including 5 (28%) and 17 (71%) patients in the wild-type and missense mutation groups, whereas none of the patients with truncating mutation exhibited p53 immunopositivity (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: The TP53 mutation status correlated with poor prognosis in surgically treated HPSCC patients. Specifically, truncating mutations which were not detected by p53 immunohistochemistry were predictive of worst survival. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The use of bacteria as drug carriers meets several challenges, such as biocompatibility, motility deterioration after drug loading and lack of in vivo verification. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is one of the best studied probiotic strains, and doxorubicin (DOX) is conjugated onto EcN in the current study via acid-labile linkers of cis-aconitic anhydride (EcN-ca-Dox), realizing the bacteria-directed accumulation and acid-responsive release of anticancer drugs in tumors. The drug conjugation has maintained the bacterial motion profiles of over 9 μm/s and cell viability of over 70%. After 3 h and 3 days of intravenous injection of EcN-ca-Dox, DOX accumulations in tumors are determined as 12.9% and 6.4% of the injected doses per gram of tissue, respectively, which are much higher than the commonly used nanocarriers. Compared with free DOX and DOX-conjugated EcN via stable linkers of succinic anhydride, the EcN-ca-Dox treatment improves the antitumor efficacy with respect to the tumor growth inhibition, prolongation of animal survivals, and apoptosis induction of tumor cells. In addition, EcN has been cleaned off from tumors and other tissues after antimicrobial treatment. Thus, the acid-labile EcN conjugates provide a safe and concise strategy to enhance the temporal and spatial controllability of anticancer drugs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) is a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for cancer cells to acquire chemoresistance. The effects of BMP4 on OXA sensitivity in HCC need to be elucidated. Methods Functional analysis of BMP4 on EMT-regulated OXA sensitivity was performed in human HCC specimens, in the HCC cell lines HepG2 and HCCLM3, and in a subcutaneous tumor model receiving OXA treatment. The downstream signaling targets of BMP4 in HCC were profiled and confirmed. Results BMP4 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissue, and was correlated with tumor de-differentiation and unfavorable prognosis. BMP4 promoted HCC EMT and was correlated with OXA resistance. Blocking of BMP4 reversed EMT and increased OXA chemosensitivity in vitro and in vivo. ELK1, a transcription factor involved in EMT, was an important mediator of BMP4-induced OXA resistance in HCC. Blocking of MEK/ERK/ELK1 attenuated BMP4-induced EMT and enhanced OXA sensitivity. Conclusions BMP4 induces EMT and OXA chemoresistance via MEK/ERK/ELK1 signaling pathway in HCC. BMP4 may be a valuable therapeutic target for HCC patients receiving OXA-based chemotherapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE To observe the effect of vitamin K 2 (VK 2 ) on expression of BTG2 and Cyclin D1 in Hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2 cell line,and to investigate the mechanism of inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of Hep-G2 cells by VK 2 . METHODS The growth inhibition of Hep-G2 cells was detected by CCK-8 method. Effect of VK 2 on cell apoptosis and proliferation was checked by flow cytometry. The expressions of BTG2 and Cyclin D1 protein were tested by Western blot,the transcription levels of BTG2 and Cyclin D1 mRNAs were checked by RT-PCR. RESULTS With the increase of concentration(40,80,160 μmol/L),the proliferations of Hep-G2 cells were inhibited in a dose and time dependent manner,and IC 50 value was 65.17 μmol/L after drug intervention for 48 hours. The results of flow cytometry showed that the cells proportion of G 1 phase in the experimental group (55±1.0)% was significantly higher than that of the control group (44±1.0)%,and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.000 3),which illustrated that VK 2 could block the cell cycle to G 1 phase. In addition,the results of apoptosis measured by flow cytometry showed that the apoptosis rate in the middle and late stage of the experiment group was significantly different from that in the control group (F=275.6,P&lt;0.05). In addition,the rate of apoptosis was correlated positively with time (F=693.3,P&lt;0.01).Western blot results showed that with the treating time protracting,the expression of BTG2 was 0.138±0.001,0.258±0.013,0.330±0.007 respectively at 24,48 and 72 h,which showed an upward trend,and the difference was significant (F=993.7,P&lt;0.01) when compared with the control group (0.021±0.001),while the expression of Cyclin D1 protein was 0.411±0.002,0.372±0.005,0.232±0.006 at the same time,which decreased gradually,in addation,compared to the control group (0.733±0.032) the difference was statistically significant (F=489.7,P&lt;0.01). RT-PCR indicated that the expressions of BTG2 mRNA was 1.13±0.46,1.15±0.03,1.22±0.37 at 24,48 and 72 h,which indicated that the variation trend of upregulation was not obvious with the extension of time (P&gt;0.05).Compared with the control group (1.00±0.00),the difference was not clear in the light of statistics (F=0.30,P=0.83). However,the expressions of Cyclin D1 mRNA in the three period of time was 0.63±0.03,0.44±0.05,0.14±0.03,which showed that VK 2 could downgradulate the expression of Cyclin D1 mRNA,and the difference was statistically significant (F=415.6,P&lt;0.01) comparing to the control group (1.00±0.00). CONCLUSIONS VK 2 could inhibit the proliferation of Hep-G2 cells and induce apoptosis,and the mechanisim may be related to the upregulation of BTG2 and downregulation of Cyclin D1 by VK 2 .This provides a new basis for VK 2 as a natural medicine for the treatment of liver cancer. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

    "Abstract": "Background: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Programs (ERP) includes multimodal approaches of perioperative patient's clinical pathways designed to achieve early recovery after surgery and a decreased length of hospital stay (LOS). Methods: This observational study evaluated the implementation of ERP in gynaecologic oncological surgery in a minimally invasive techniques (MIT) expert center with more than 85% of procedures done with MIT. We compared a prospective cohort of 100 patients involved in ERP between December 2015 and June 2016 to a 100 patients control group, without ERP, previously managed in the same center between April 2015 and November 2015. All the included patients were referred for hysterectomy and/or pelvic or para-aortic lymphadenectomy for gynaecological cancer. The primary objective was to achieve a significant decrease of median LOS in the ERP group. Secondary objectives were decreases in proportion of patients achieving target LOS (2 days), morbidity and readmissions. Results: Except a disparity in oncological indications with a higher proportion of endometrial cancer in the group with ERP vs. the group without ERP (42% vs. 22%; p = 0.003), there were no differences in patient's characteristics and surgical procedures. ERP were associated with decreases of median LOS (2.5 [0 to 11] days vs. 3 [1 to 14] days; p = 0.002) and proportion of discharged patient at target LOS (45% vs. 24%; p = 0.002). Morbidities occurred in 25% and 26% in the groups with and without ERP and readmission rates were respectively of 6% and 8%, without any significant difference. Conclusion: ERP in gynaecologic oncological surgery is associated with a decrease of LOS without increases of morbidity or readmission rates, even in a center with a high proportion of MIT. Although it is already widely accepted that MIT improves early recovery, our study shows that the addition of ERP's clinical pathways improve surgical outcomes and patient care management. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The BCR-ABL specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) changed the outcome of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), turning a life-threatening disease into a chronic illness. However, TKI are not yet curative, because most patients retain leukemic stem cells (LSC) and their progenitors in bone marrow and relapse following treatment cessation. At diagnosis, deregulation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway is involved in LSC and progenitor expansion. Here, we report that BMP pathway alterations persist in TKI-resistant patients. In comparison with patients in complete cytogenetic remission, TKI-resistant LSC and progenitors display high levels of BMPR1b expression and alterations of its cellular localization. In vitro treatment of immature chronic phase CML cells with TKI alone, or in combination with interferon-a, results in the preferential survival of BMPR1b1 cells.Wedemonstrated persistent and increasingBMP4production by patients' mesenchymal cells with resistance. Patient follow-up revealed an increase of BMPR1b expression and in BMP4 expression in LSC from TKI-resistant patients in comparison with diagnosis, while remaining unchanged in sensitive patients. Both leukemic and nonleukemic cells exhibit higher BMP4 levels in the bone marrow of TKIresistant patients. Exposure to BMP2/BMP4 does not alter BCR-ABL transcript expression but is accompanied by the overexpression of TWIST-1, a transcription factor highly expressed in resistant LSC. By modulating BMP4 or BMPR1b expression, we show that these elements are involved in TKI resistance. In summary, we reveal that persistence of BMP alterations and existence of an autocrine loop promote CML-primitive cells' TKI resistance. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cell division (mitosis) results in the equal segregation of chromosomes between two daughter cells. The mitotic spindle plays a pivotal role in chromosome alignment and segregation during metaphase and anaphase. Structural or functional errors of this spindle can cause aneuploidy, a hallmark of many cancers. To investigate if a given protein associates with the mitotic spindle and regulates its assembly, stability, or function, fluorescence microscopy can be performed to determine if disruption of that protein induces phenotypes indicative of spindle dysfunction. Importantly, functional disruption of proteins with specific roles during mitosis can lead to cancer cell death by inducing mitotic insult. However, there is a lack of automated computational tools to detect and quantify the effects of such disruption on spindle integrity. Results: We developed the image analysis software tool MatQuantify, which detects both large-scale and subtle structural changes in the spindle or DNA and can be used to statistically compare the effects of different treatments. MatQuantify can quantify various physical properties extracted from fluorescence microscopy images, such as area, lengths of various components, perimeter, eccentricity, fractal dimension, satellite objects and orientation. It can also measure textual properties including entropy, intensities and the standard deviation of intensities. Using MatQuantify, we studied the effect of knocking down the protein clathrin heavy chain (CHC) on the mitotic spindle. We analysed 217 microscopy images of untreated metaphase cells, 172 images of metaphase cells transfected with small interfering RNAs targeting the luciferase gene (as a negative control), and 230 images of metaphase cells depleted of CHC. Using the quantified data, we trained 23 supervised machine learning classification algorithms. The Support Vector Machine learning algorithm was the most accurate method (accuracy: 85.1%; area under the curve: 0.92) for classifying a spindle image. The Kruskal-Wallis and Tukey-Kramer tests demonstrated that solidity, compactness, eccentricity, extent, mean intensity and number of satellite objects (multipolar spindles) significantly differed between CHC-depleted cells and untreated/luciferase-knockdown cells. Conclusion: MatQuantify enables automated quantitative analysis of images of mitotic spindles. Using this tool, researchers can unambiguously test if disruption of a protein-of-interest changes metaphase spindle maintenance and thereby affects mitosis. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "AIM To determine the prevalence, characteristics and clinical course of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) in liver transplantation (LT) recipients. METHODS We retrospectively studied consecutive patients who underwent LT between January 1998 to April 2016. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from patient medical records. Imaging findings on computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were reviewed by two radiologists. RESULTS During the study period, 872 patients underwent cadaveric LT. Pancreatic cysts were identified in 53/872 (6.1%) and 31/53 (58.5%) were PCNs [28 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), 2 mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), 1 serous cystadenoma]. Patients with PCNs exhibited less male predominance (55% vs 73%, P = 0.03) compared to patients without pancreatic cysts. Thirteen patients (42%) were diagnosed with PCN pre-LT while 18 patients (58%) developed PCN post-LT. The median size of PCNs was 13mm [interquartile range (IQR) 10-20 mm]. All IPMNs were side-branch type. Most PCNs were found in the head and body of pancreas (37% each), followed by the tail (25%). Five patients underwent further evaluation with endoscopic ultrasound. Progress imaging was performed on 81% of patients. PCNs remained stable in size and number in all but 2 patients. During a median follow up of 39 mo (IQR 26-58 mo), the 2 (6%) patients with MCN underwent pancreatectomy. No PCN patient developed pancreatic adenocarcinoma, while 5 died from illnesses unrelated to the PCN. Among patients without PCN, 1/841 (0.1%) developed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION The prevalence of PCNs in LT recipients was similar to the general population (3.6%, 31/872). Side-branch IPMNs do not appear to have accelerated malignant potential in post-LT patients, indicating the current surveillance guidelines are applicable to this group. © The Author(s) 2017.

    "Abstract": "Background: Phenotypic classification is problematic because small samples are ubiquitous; and, for these, use of prior knowledge is critical. If knowledge concerning the feature-label distribution - for instance, genetic pathways - is available, then it can be used in learning. Optimal Bayesian classification provides optimal classification under model uncertainty. It differs from classical Bayesian methods in which a classification model is assumed and prior distributions are placed on model parameters. With optimal Bayesian classification, uncertainty is treated directly on the feature-label distribution, which assures full utilization of prior knowledge and is guaranteed to outperform classical methods. Results: The salient problem confronting optimal Bayesian classification is prior construction. In this paper, we propose a new prior construction methodology based on a general framework of constraints in the form of conditional probability statements. We call this prior the maximal knowledge-driven information prior (MKDIP). The new constraint framework is more flexible than our previous methods as it naturally handles the potential inconsistency in archived regulatory relationships and conditioning can be augmented by other knowledge, such as population statistics. We also extend the application of prior construction to a multinomial mixture model when labels are unknown, which often occurs in practice. The performance of the proposed methods is examined on two important pathway families, the mammalian cell-cycle and a set of p53-related pathways, and also on a publicly available gene expression dataset of non-small cell lung cancer when combined with the existing prior knowledge on relevant signaling pathways. Conclusion: The new proposed general prior construction framework extends the prior construction methodology to a more flexible framework that results in better inference when proper prior knowledge exists. Moreover, the extension of optimal Bayesian classification to multinomial mixtures where data sets are both small and unlabeled, enables superior classifier design using small, unstructured data sets. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach using pathway information and available knowledge of gene regulating functions; however, the underlying theory can be applied to a wide variety of knowledge types, and other applications when there are small samples. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In order to recognize multi-class cervical cells automatically, a hierarchical method with PCA (principal component analysis) feature transformation was proposed and this cell recognition could provide the evidence for cervical cancer diagnosis. The cervical cell recognition was treated as a 4-class classification problem. There were two levels in this hierarchical method. First, one-versus-one strategy was used to train 6 SVM (support vector machine) classifiers to do a 3-class classification. Second, abnormal cells in one type of 3 categories were classified by a 2-class SVM. To optimize the feature combination and reduce the running time, a feature transformation method named PCA was adopted to transform the original feature vector into low-dimension feature space. The experiments show that the proposed hierarchical PCA recognition method is faster than the common hierarchical method at a ratio of 21.31%, and can distinguish 4 cervical cell categories better than 6 other traditional methods and achieve above 90% accuracy. © 2017, NUDT Press.

    "Abstract": "Background: Cisplatin is one of the first-line drugs for urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) treatment. However, its considerable side effects and the emergence of drug resistance are becoming major limitations for its application. This study aimed to investigate whether matrine and cisplatin could present a synergistic anti-tumor effect on UBC cells. Methods: Cell viability assay was used to assess the suppressive effect of matrine and cisplatin on the proliferation of the UBC cells. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were applied respectively to determine the migration and invasion ability of the cells. The distribution of cell cycles, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the apoptosis rate were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The expressions of the relative proteins in apoptotic signal pathways and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related genes were surveyed by western blotting. The binding modes of the drugs within the proteins were detected by CDOCKER module in DS 2.5. Results: Both matrine and cisplatin could inhibit the growth of the UBC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. When matrine combined with cisplatin at the ratio of 2000:1, they presented a synergistic inhibitory effect on the UBC cells. The combinative treatment could impair cell migration and invasion ability, arrest cell cycle in the G1 and S phases, increase the level of ROS, and induce apoptosis in EJ and T24 cells in a synergistic way. In all the treated groups, the expressions of E-cadherin, β-catenin, Bax, and Cleaved Caspase-3 were up-regulated, while the expressions of Fibronectin, Vimentin, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, p-Akt, p-PI3K, VEGFR2, and VEGF proteins were down-regulated, and among them, the combination of matrine and cisplatin showed the most significant difference. Molecular docking algorithms predicted that matrine and cisplatin could be docked into the same active sites and interact with different residues within the tested proteins. Conclusions: Our results suggested that the combination of matrine and cisplatin could synergistically inhibit the UBC cells' proliferation through down-regulating VEGF/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, indicating that matrine may serve as a new option in the combinative therapy in the treatment of UBC. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prediction of drug-disease interactions is promising for either drug repositioning or disease treatment fields. The discovery of novel drug-disease interactions, on one hand can help to find novel indictions for the approved drugs; on the other hand can provide new therapeutic approaches for the diseases. Recently, computational methods for finding drug-disease interactions have attracted lots of attention because of their far more higher efficiency and lower cost than the traditional wet experiment methods. However, they still face several challenges, such as the organization of the heterogeneous data, the performance of the model, and so on. Methods: In this work, we present to hierarchically integrate the heterogeneous data into three layers. The drug-drug and disease-disease similarities are first calculated separately in each layer, and then the similarities from three layers are linearly fused into comprehensive drug similarities and disease similarities, which can then be used to measure the similarities between two drug-disease pairs. We construct a novel weighted drug-disease pair network, where a node is a drug-disease pair with known or unknown treatment relation, an edge represents the node-node relation which is weighted with the similarity score between two pairs. Now that similar drug-disease pairs are supposed to show similar treatment patterns, we can find the optimal graph cut of the network. The drug-disease pair with unknown relation can then be considered to have similar treatment relation with that within the same cut. Therefore, we develop a semi-supervised graph cut algorithm, SSGC, to find the optimal graph cut, based on which we can identify the potential drug-disease treatment interactions. Results: By comparing with three representative network-based methods, SSGC achieves the highest performances, in terms of both AUC score and the identification rates of true drug-disease pairs. The experiments with different integration strategies also demonstrate that considering several sources of data can improve the performances of the predictors. Further case studies on four diseases, the top-ranked drug-disease associations have been confirmed by KEGG, CTD database and the literature, illustrating the usefulness of SSGC. Conclusions: The proposed comprehensive similarity scores from multi-views and multiple layers and the graph-cut based algorithm can greatly improve the prediction performances of drug-disease associations. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: (-)-Balanol is an ATP mimic that inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) with limited selectivity. While PKA is a tumour promoter, PKC isozymes act as tumour promoters or suppressors, depending on the cancer type. In particular, PKCε is frequently implicated in cancer promotion, making it a potential target for anticancer drugs. To improve isozyme selectivity of balanol, exhaustive structural and activity relationship (SAR) studies have been performed in the last two decades, but with limited success. More recently, fluorination on balanol has shown improved selectivity for PKCε, although the fluorine effect is not yet clearly understood. Understanding the origin to this fluorine-based selectivity will be valuable for designing better balanol-based ATP mimicking inhibitors. Computational approaches such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can decipher the fluorine effect, provided that correct charges have been assigned to a ligand. Balanol analogues have multiple ionisable functional groups and the effect of fluorine substitutions on the exact charge state of each analogue bound to PKA and to PKCε needs to be thoroughly investigated in order to design highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic applications. Results: We explored the charge states of novel fluorinated balanol analogues using MD simulations. For different potential charge states of these analogues, Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA) binding energy values were computed. This study suggests that balanol and the most potent fluorinated analogue (5S fluorine substitution on the azepane ring), have charges on the azepane ring (N1), and the phenolic (C6''OH) and the carboxylate (C15''O2H) groups on the benzophenone moiety, when bound to PKCε as well as PKA. Conclusions: To the best our knowledge, this is the first study showing that the phenolate group is charged in balanol and its analogues binding to the ATP site of PKCε. Correct charge assignments of ligands are important to obtain predicted binding energy values from MD simulations that reflect experimental values. Both fluorination and the local enzymatic environment of the ATP site can influence the exact charge states of balanol analogues. Overall, this study is highly valuable for further rational design of potent balanol analogues selective to PKCε. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Functional magnetic and biocompatible particles are of great interest because of their potential use in various bioapplications such as hyperthermia for cancer treatment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents and drug delivery. Herein, we introduce a facile method for synthesizing magnetic Fe nanocrystal/Fe-substituted calcium phosphate (Fe/FeCaP) heterostructured microspheres using a two-step procedure: (1) one-pot hydrothermal synthesis to prepare uniform-sized FeCaP microspheres and (2) post-reduction annealing at 600 °C for Fe extraction from FeCaP. This approach results in the fabrication of Fe/FeCaP heterostructured microspheres that exhibit superparamagnetism with a saturation magnetization of 10.77 emu g-1. The Fe/FeCaP particles annealed at 600 °C show a much higher magnetic moment compared with the non-annealed FeCaP particles. Moreover, T2-weighted MRI phantom images reveal that the Fe/FeCaP heterostructured microspheres possess higher relaxivity than paramagnetic FeCaP, demonstrating their potential as superior and biocompatible MRI contrast agents. Moreover, the enhancement in osteoconductivity for Fe/FeCaP microspheres without any evidence of cytotoxicity was verified. Our results demonstrate the great potential of multi-functional Fe/FeCaP microspheres for use as biocompatible bone regeneration agents as well as MRI contrast agents. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma that is refractory to or that relapses after immunochemotherapy and transplantation have a poor prognosis. High response rates have been reported with the use of T cells modified by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that target CD19 in B-cell cancers, although data regarding B-cell lymphomas are limited. METHODS We used autologous T cells that express a CD19-directed CAR (CTL019) to treat patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma that had relapsed or was refractory to previous treatments. Patients were monitored for response to treatment, toxic effects, the expansion and persistence of CTL019 cells in vivo, and immune recovery. RESULTS A total of 28 adult patients with lymphoma received CTL019 cells, and 18 of 28 had a response (64%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 81). Complete remission occurred in 6 of 14 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (43%; 95% CI, 18 to 71) and 10 of 14 patients with follicular lymphoma (71%; 95% CI, 42 to 92). CTL019 cells proliferated in vivo and were detectable in the blood and bone marrow of patients who had a response and patients who did not have a response. Sustained remissions were achieved, and at a median follow-up of 28.6 months, 86% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who had a response (95% CI, 33 to 98) and 89% of patients with follicular lymphoma who had a response (95% CI, 43 to 98) had maintained the response. Severe cytokine-release syndrome occurred in 5 patients (18%). Serious encephalopathy occurred in 3 patients (11%); 2 cases were self-limiting and 1 case was fatal. All patients in complete remission by 6 months remained in remission at 7.7 to 37.9 months (median, 29.3 months) after induction, with a sustained reappearance of B cells in 8 of 16 patients and with improvement in levels of IgG in 4 of 10 patients and of IgM in 6 of 10 patients at 6 months or later and in levels of IgA in 3 of 10 patients at 18 months or later. CONCLUSIONS CTL019 cells can be effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. High rates of durable remission were observed, with recovery of B cells and immunoglobulins in some patients. Transient encephalopathy developed in approximately one in three patients and severe cytokine-release syndrome developed in one in five patients. © 2017 Massachusetts Medical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Biological data comprises various topologies or a mixture of forms, which makes its analysis extremely complicated. With this data increasing in a daily basis, the design and development of efficient and accurate statistical methods has become absolutely necessary. Specific analyses, such as those related to genome-wide association studies and multi-omics information, are often aimed at clustering sub-conditions of cancers and other diseases. Hierarchical clustering methods, which can be categorized into agglomerative and divisive, have been widely used in such situations. However, unlike agglomerative methods divisive clustering approaches have consistently proved to be computationally expensive. Results: The proposed clustering algorithm (DRAGON) was verified on mutation and microarray data, and was gauged against standard clustering methods in the literature. Its validation included synthetic and significant biological data. When validated on mixed-lineage leukemia data, DRAGON achieved the highest clustering accuracy with data of four different dimensions. Consequently, DRAGON outperformed previous methods with 3-,4- and 5-dimensional acute leukemia data. When tested on mutation data, DRAGON achieved the best performance with 2-dimensional information. Conclusions: This work proposes a computationally efficient divisive hierarchical clustering method, which can compete equally with agglomerative approaches. The proposed method turned out to correctly cluster data with distinct topologies.

    "Abstract": "Background: Restoration of the lateral ankle after distal fibulectomy is a difficult reconstructive procedure. Many surgical techniques have been proposed. This report shows another fibular reconstructive option with promising outcome. Case presentation: We report the case of a 30-year-old woman who presented with a solitary mass located in the lateral aspect of the ankle. The mass had grown rapidly for 2 months and caused increasing pain. Physical examination showed a 3.0 cm diameter tender, nonmobile hard mass in the lateral malleolus. Radiographs showed an osteolytic lesion involving the lateral cortex at the distal fibula. After incisional biopsy, pathologic examination found a well-differentiated intramedullary osteosarcoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin was provided for 3 months prior to definitive surgical treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging showed persistent tumor in the biopsy site. After distal fibulectomy and wide resection, split tibialis posterior tendon transfer to the remaining peroneus brevis restored the stability of the ankle. The pain resolved within 3 months. The ankle was stable and no recurrence of the cancer was found at a 7 year follow-up. Conclusion: Reconstruction following distal fibulectomy and surrounding soft tissue resection responds favorably to split tibialis posterior transfer to the remaining peroneus brevis suggesting that this technique can provide a good and functional outcome. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important modulators of epigenetic gene regulation and additionally control the activity of non-histone protein substrates. While for HDACs 1-3 and 6 many potent selective inhibitors have been obtained, for other subtypes much less is known on selective inhibitors and the consequences of their inhibition. The present report describes the development of substituted benzhydroxamic acids as potent and selective HDAC8 inhibitors. Docking studies using available crystal structures have been used for structure-based optimization of this series of compounds. Within this study, we have investigated the role of HDAC8 in the proliferation of cancer cells and optimized hits for potency and selectivity, both in vitro and in cell culture. The combination of structure-based design, synthesis, and in vitro screening to cellular testing resulted in potent and selective HDAC8 inhibitors that showed anti-neuroblastoma activity in cellular testing. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Differential co-expression (DCX) signifies change in degree of co-expression of a set of genes among different biological conditions. It has been used to identify differential co-expression networks or interactomes. Many algorithms have been developed for single-factor differential co-expression analysis and applied in a variety of studies. However, in many studies, the samples are characterized by multiple factors such as genetic markers, clinical variables and treatments. No algorithm or methodology is available for multi-factor analysis of differential co-expression. Results: We developed a novel formulation and a computationally efficient greedy search algorithm called MultiDCoX to perform multi-factor differential co-expression analysis. Simulated data analysis demonstrates that the algorithm can effectively elicit differentially co-expressed (DCX) gene sets and quantify the influence of each factor on co-expression. MultiDCoX analysis of a breast cancer dataset identified interesting biologically meaningful differentially co-expressed (DCX) gene sets along with genetic and clinical factors that influenced the respective differential co-expression. Conclusions: MultiDCoX is a space and time efficient procedure to identify differentially co-expressed gene sets and successfully identify influence of individual factors on differential co-expression. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Accumulating biological and clinical reports have indicated that imbalance of microbial community is closely associated with occurrence and development of various complex human diseases. Identifying potential microbe-disease associations, which could provide better understanding of disease pathology and further boost disease diagnostic and prognostic, has attracted more and more attention. However, hardly any computational models have been developed for large scale microbe-disease association prediction. Results: In this article, based on the assumption that microbes with similar functions tend to share similar association or non-association patterns with similar diseases and vice versa, we proposed the model of Network Consistency Projection for Human Microbe-Disease Association prediction (NCPHMDA) by integrating known microbe-disease associations and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for microbes and diseases. NCPHMDA yielded outstanding AUCs of 0.9039, 0.7953 and average AUC of 0.8918 in global leave-one-out cross validation, local leave-one-out cross validation and 5-fold cross validation, respectively. Furthermore, colon cancer, asthma and type 2 diabetes were taken as independent case studies, where 9, 9 and 8 out of the top 10 predicted microbes were successfully confirmed by recent published clinical literature. Conclusion: NCPHMDA is a non-parametric universal network-based method which can simultaneously predict associated microbes for investigated diseases but does not require negative samples. It is anticipated that NCPHMDA would become an effective biological resource for clinical experimental guidance. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prediction in high dimensional settings is difficult due to the large number of variables relative to the sample size. We demonstrate how auxiliary 'co-data' can be used to improve the performance of a Random Forest in such a setting. Results: Co-data are incorporated in the Random Forest by replacing the uniform sampling probabilities that are used to draw candidate variables by co-data moderated sampling probabilities. Co-data here are defined as any type information that is available on the variables of the primary data, but does not use its response labels. These moderated sampling probabilities are, inspired by empirical Bayes, learned from the data at hand. We demonstrate the co-data moderated Random Forest (CoRF) with two examples. In the first example we aim to predict the presence of a lymph node metastasis with gene expression data. We demonstrate how a set of external p-values, a gene signature, and the correlation between gene expression and DNA copy number can improve the predictive performance. In the second example we demonstrate how the prediction of cervical (pre-)cancer with methylation data can be improved by including the location of the probe relative to the known CpG islands, the number of CpG sites targeted by a probe, and a set of p-values from a related study. Conclusion: The proposed method is able to utilize auxiliary co-data to improve the performance of a Random Forest. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a new class of small non-coding RNAs that are known to be associated with RNA silencing. The piRNAs play an important role in protecting the genome from invasive transposons in the germline. Recent studies have shown that piRNAs are linked to the genome stability and a variety of human cancers. Due to their clinical importance, there is a pressing need for effective computational methods that can be used for computational identification of piRNAs. However, piRNAs lack conserved structural motifs and show relatively low sequence similarity across different species, which makes accurate computational prediction of piRNAs challenging. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel method, piRNAdetect, for reliable computational prediction of piRNAs in genome sequences. In the proposed method, we first classify piRNA sequences in the training dataset that share similar sequence motifs and extract effective predictive features through the use of n-gram models (NGMs). The extracted NGM-based features are then used to construct a support vector machine that can be used for accurate prediction of novel piRNAs. Conclusions: We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed piRNAdetect algorithm through extensive performance evaluation based on piRNAs in three different species - H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, and M. musculus - obtained from the piRBase and show that piRNAdetect outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Effective and sensitive microRNA detection is a great challenge. Most microRNA assays use an amplification strategy to obtain high sensitivity, which makes them complicated. Herein, we present a simple and amplification-free solid-state electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for the detection of miRNA based on high effective quenching by ferrocene and using N-butyldiethanolamine (BDEA) as a more effective co-reactant. Initially, the mixture of Nafion and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) was cast onto the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to form a Nafion-AuNPs film. The resulting electrode was then immersed into a solution of Ru(bpy)3 2+, where the solid-state Nafion-AuNPs/Ru(bpy)3 2+ could be obtained via electrostatic adsorption. The DNA molecular beacon, which was modified with thiol at one distal and the other was labeled with ferrocene (i.e., Fc-MB), was covalently attached to AuNPs on the ECL film through a Au-S bond. Afterwards, the remaining active sites of nonspecific adsorption were blocked with 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH). When the target miRNA was present, it hybridized with the complementary part in the loop of Fc-MB and formed a double-stranded structure. This conformational change led the quencher away from the electrode, resulting in a remarkable increase in ECL intensity. Under the optimum condition, the ECL signal had a linear relationship with miRNA concentration ranging from 0.01 pM to 1 × 103 pM, with a limit of detection of 10 fM. Moreover, our biosensor showed remarkable specificity, outstanding reproducibility, good stability and excellent performance in real sample investigation with no amplification. Therefore, this developed strategy has great potential in early miRNA-related cancer diagnosis. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Human papillomavirus infection is a global social burden that, every year, leads to thousands new diagnosis of cancer. The introduction of a protocol of immunization, with Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines, has radically changed the way this infection easily spreads among people. Even though vaccination is only preventive and not therapeutic, it is a strong tool capable to avoid the consequences that this pathogen could cause. Gardasil vaccine is not free from side effects and the duration of immunity is not always well determined. This work aim to enhance the effects of the vaccination by using a new class of adjuvants and a different administration protocol. Due to their minimum side effects, their easy extraction, their low production costs and their proven immune stimulating activity, citrus-derived molecules are valid candidates to be administered as adjuvants in a vaccine formulation against Hpv. Results: With the aim to get a stronger immune response against Hpv infection we built an in silico model that delivers a way to predict the best adjuvants and the optimal means of administration to obtain such a goal. Simulations envisaged that the use of Neohesperidin elicited a strong immune response that was then validated in vivo. Conclusions: We built up a computational infrastructure made by a virtual screening approach able to preselect promising citrus derived compounds, and by an agent based model that reproduces HPV dynamics subject to vaccine stimulation. This integrated methodology was able to predict the best protocol that confers a very good immune response against HPV infection. We finally tested the in silico results through in vivo experiments on mice, finding good agreement. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Clustering methods are becoming widely utilized in biomedical research where the volume and complexity of data is rapidly increasing. Unsupervised clustering of patient information can reveal distinct phenotype groups with different underlying mechanism, risk prognosis and treatment response. However, biological datasets are usually characterized by a combination of low sample number and very high dimensionality, something that is not adequately addressed by current algorithms. While the performance of the methods is satisfactory for low dimensional data, increasing number of features results in either deterioration of accuracy or inability to cluster. To tackle these challenges, new methodologies designed specifically for such data are needed. Results: We present 2D-EM, a clustering algorithm approach designed for small sample size and high-dimensional datasets. To employ information corresponding to data distribution and facilitate visualization, the sample is folded into its two-dimension (2D) matrix form (or feature matrix). The maximum likelihood estimate is then estimated using a modified expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The 2D-EM methodology was benchmarked against several existing clustering methods using 6 medically-relevant transcriptome datasets. The percentage improvement of Rand score and adjusted Rand index compared to the best performing alternative method is up to 21.9% and 155.6%, respectively. To present the general utility of the 2D-EM method we also employed 2 methylome datasets, again showing superior performance relative to established methods. Conclusions: The 2D-EM algorithm was able to reproduce the groups in transcriptome and methylome data with high accuracy. This build confidence in the methods ability to uncover novel disease subtypes in new datasets. The design of 2D-EM algorithm enables it to handle a diverse set of challenging biomedical dataset and cluster with higher accuracy than established methods.

    "Abstract": "Background: Opioid addiction prevention has become an urgent public health priority, with several countries declaring a state of emergency due to rising death tolls from opioid abuse. Reducing the risk of developing addiction among opioid-naïve patients exposed to prescribed opioids during the process of medical care may be an important primary prevention strategy. Our objective is to synthesize the available evidence about factors associated with the development of addiction among patients first exposed to prescribed opioids, with a focus on opioid-naïve patients. Methods: We will perform a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and other databases in collaboration with a health information specialist using a comprehensive search strategy. We will also supplement our search with a scan of the grey literature to identify relevant ongoing and unpublished studies. We will include studies reporting on risk factors for opioid addiction in patients prescribed opioid analgesic therapy through a prescription from a licensed medical professional, with a focus on opioid-naïve patients. We will exclude studies focusing on patients who are first exposed to illicit opioids, those who use prescription opioids for cancer pain, and/or who are palliative. Two reviewers will independently review titles, abstracts, and full texts for inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will then extract data from included full texts using standardized piloted data extraction forms and assess study quality through risk of bias assessment. We will synthesize the effect sizes of risk factors derived from clinically homogenous studies with similar designs and the remaining ones qualitatively. Discussion: Understanding risk factors for opioid addiction among patients who require analgesia has the potential to inform clinical care and opioid prescribing guidelines aiming to reduce opioid addiction. We will also use this information as a starting point for developing interventions for primary prevention. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nausea and vomiting are common side effects in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Proper control of these symptoms might improve quality of life in these patients. Addition of cannabinoids to standard antiemetic treatment has been proposed in order to improve control of these symptoms.METHODS: To answer this question we used Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, conducted a meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified 16 systematic reviews that include 61 primary studies. Out of these, four were randomized trials that answered our question. At present, given that the certainty of the evidence is very low, it is unclear whether the addition of cannabinoids to standard antiemetic regimes benefits patients with chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. Cannabinoids probably increase adverse effects substantively.INTRODUCCIÓN: El tratamiento de las náuseas y vómitos inducidos por quimioterapia podría mejorar la calidad de vida de los pacientes oncológicos; para lograrlo se ha propuesto la adición de cannabinoides a los esquemas de antieméticos habituales.MÉTODOS: Para responder esta pregunta utilizamos Epistemonikos, la mayor base de datos de revisiones sistemáticas en salud, la cual es mantenida mediante búsquedas en múltiples fuentes de información, incluyendo MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, entre otras. Extrajimos los datos desde las revisiones identificadas, reanalizamos los datos de los estudios primarios, realizamos un metanálisis y preparamos tablas de resumen de los resultados utilizando el método GRADE.RESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES: Identificamos 16 revisiones sistemáticas que en conjunto incluyen 61 estudios primarios, de los cuales cuatro son ensayos aleatorizados que responden a la pregunta de interés. Concluimos que no hay claridad respecto a si los cannabinoides otorgan un beneficio al añadirlos a esquemas antieméticos habituales para el control de náuseas y vómitos inducidos por quimioterapia, porque la certeza de la evidencia es muy baja. Probablemente aumentan los efectos adversos de manera sustantiva.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To evaluate the effect of probiotics on intestinal mucosal barrier function and inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with diarrhea secondary to chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS Ninety patients with chemotherapy-associated diarrhea treated at Taizhou Municipal Hospital from January 2015 to December 2016 were randomly divided into a control group (n = 45) and an observation group (n = 45). Both groups were given montmorillonite powder-based conventional symptomatic treatment, and the observation group was additionally given Bifidobacterium triple viable capsules. Clinical efficacy, intestinal mucosal barrier function, inflammatory cytokine levels, and intestinal flora were compared between the two groups. RESULTS In the observation group, 25 (55.56%) cases showed marked improvement and 17 (37.78%) cases showed improvement, with a total effective rate of 93.33%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (75.56%; P < 0.05). Before treatment, intestinal mucosal barrier function indexes were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05); after treatment, diamine oxidase, D-lactic acid, and endothelin were significantly decreased in both groups, and the decrease was significantly more remarkable in the observation group (P < 0.05). Before treatment, inflammatory cytokines in the two groups were similar (P > 0.05); after treatment, tumor necrosis factor-α, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 were significantly decreased in both groups, and the decrease was significantly more remarkable in the observation group (P < 0.05). The number of intestinal microbes after treatment was significantly lower than that before treatment in the control group. In the observation group, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus were significantly increased after treatment, and the number of intestinal microbes was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli showed no significant changes between before and after treatment in the observation group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Auxiliary application of probiotics can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy for chemotherapyinduced diarrhea in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, improve intestinal mucosal barrier function, regulate the balance of intestinal flora disturbance, and reconstruct intestinal ecological balance. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular (HCC) and cholangiocellular carcinomas (CCC) display an exceptionally poor prognosis. Especially for advanced disease no efficient standard therapy is currently available. Recently, somatostatin analogs have been evaluated for the treatment of HCC, however, with contradictory results. Besides, for both malignancies the chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been discussed as a possible new target structure. Methods: Expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes 1, 2A, 3, 4, and 5, and of CXCR4 was evaluated in a total of 71 HCCs and 27 CCCs by immunohistochemistry using well-characterized novel monoclonal antibodies. Results: In HCC tumor cells, frequency and intensity of expression of SSTRs and CXCR4 were only low. CXCR4 was present in about 40% of the HCCs, although at a low intensity. SSTR5, SSTR2, and SSTR3 were detected in about 15%, 8%, and 5% of the HCC tumors, respectively. SSTR and CXCR4 expression was much higher in CCC than in HCC. CXCR4 and SSTR1 were present in 60% and 67% of the CCC samples, respectively, followed by SSTR2 and SSTR5, which were detected in 30% and 11% of the tumors, respectively. Most notably, CXCR4 was intensely expressed on the tumor capillaries in about 50% of the HCCs and CCCs. CXCR4 expression on tumor vessels was associated with poor patient outcomes. Conclusions: CCC, but not HCC, may be suitable for SSTR-based treatments. Because of the predominant expression of SSTR1, pan-somatostatin analogs should be preferred. In both HCC and CCC, indirect targeting of tumors via the CXCR4-positive tumor capillaries may represent a promising additional therapeutic strategy. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Photochemical internalization (PCI) is a technology to enhance intracellular drug delivery by light-induced translocation of endocytosed therapeutics into the cytosol. The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of PCI-based delivery of bleomycin and the impact on systemic anti-tumor immunity. Mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26.CL25), stably expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase, were inoculated into the legs of athymic or immuno-competent BALB/c mice strains. The mice were injected with the photosensitizer AlPcS2a and bleomycin (BLM) prior to tumor light exposure from a 670 nm diode laser. Photochemical activation of BLM was found to induce synergistic inhibition of tumor growth as compared to the sum of the individual treatments. However, a curative effect was not observed in the athymic mice exposed to 30 J/cm2 of light while &gt; 90% of the thymic mice were cured after exposure to only 15 J/cm2 light. Cured thymic mice, re-challenged with CT26.CL25 tumor cells on the contralateral leg, rejected 57–100% of the tumor cells inoculated immediately and up to 2 months after the photochemical treatment. T-cells from the spleen of PCI-treated mice were found to inhibit the growth of CT26.CL25 cells in naïve thymic mice with a 60% rejection rate. The results show that treatment of CT26.CL25 tumors in thymic mice by PCI of BLM induces a systemic anti-tumor immunity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "SLAMF7 is under intense investigation as a target for immunotherapy in multiple myeloma. In this study, we redirected the specificity of T cells to SLAMF7 through expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) derived from the huLuc63 antibody (elotuzumab) and demonstrate that SLAMF7-CAR T cells prepared from patients and healthy donors confer potent antimyeloma reactivity. We confirmed uniform, high-level expression ofSLAMF7on malignant plasma cells in previously untreated and in relapsed/ refractory (R/R) myeloma patients who had received previous treatment with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs. Consequently, SLAMF7-CAR T cells conferred rapid cytolysis of previously untreatedandR/R primarymyeloma cells in vitro. In addition, a single administration of SLAMF7-CAR T cells led to resolution of medullary and extramedullary myeloma manifestations in a murine xenograft model in vivo. SLAMF7 is expressed on a fraction of normal lymphocytes, including subsets of natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, andBcells. After modification with theSLAMF7-CAR, bothCD81 andCD41 T cells rapidly acquired and maintained a SLAMF7- phenotype and could be readily expanded to therapeutically relevant cell doses. We analyzed the recognition of normal lymphocytes by SLAMF7-CAR T cells and show that they induce selective fratricide of SLAMF7+/high NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and B cells. Importantly, however, the fratricide conferred by SLAMF7-CAR T cells spares the SLAMF7-/low fraction in each cell subset and preserves functional lymphocytes, including virus-specific T cells. In aggregate, our data illustrate the potential use of SLAMF7-CAR T-cell therapy as an effective treatment against multiple myeloma and provide novel insights into the consequences of targeting SLAMF7 for the normal lymphocyte compartment. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study provides a comprehensive examination of the histological features of non-neoplastic parenchyma in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We prospectively collected radical nephrectomy (RN) specimens, to analyze the histological changes within peritumoral and distant parenchyma. Methods: Data of patients who underwent RN and had no known history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or chronic kidney disease etc., were prospectively collected. Tumor pseudo-capsule (PC), and parenchyma within 2 cm from tumor margin, were pathologically assessed. The parenchyma beyond PC or tumor margin was divided into 20 subsections of 1 mm in width. Histological changes, including chronic inflammation, glomerulosclerosis, arteriosclerosis and nephrosclerosis, were given scores of 0, 1, 2 or 3 for each subsection of each specimen, according to their severity. The 20 subsections of each specimen were further divided into four groups according to the distance from the tumor edge (group 1: 0-2 mm; group 2: 2-5 mm; group 3: 5-10 mm; group 4: 10-20 mm), to better compare the peritumoral parenchyma with the distant parenchyma. Results: In total, 53 patients were involved in this study. All tumors were confirmed RCCs (clear cell vs. papillary vs. chromophobe were 83% vs. 5.7% vs. 11.3%, respectively), with a mean size of 5.6 cm. Histological changes were more severe in peritumoral parenchyma close to PC or tumor edge (0-5 mm), and less common within parenchyma more distant from the tumor (5-20 mm) (p < 0.001). chronic inflammation and nephrosclerosis were the most common changes especially in peritumoral parenchyma (0-2 mm). PC was present in 49 tumors (92.5%), and PC invasion occurred in 5 cases (10.2%). Mean PC thickness was 0.7 mm. PCs were more likely to be present in clear cell RCC or papillary RCC than in chromophobe RCC (100% vs. 100% vs. 33.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Most RCCs have a well-developed PC, especially clear cell RCC. Histological changes mainly occur in peritumoral parenchyma, being rather uncommon in distant parenchyma. A compression band filled with severe histological changes was typically observed in renal parenchyma close to the tumor. Its preservation while performing an enucleation margin may not be entirely necessary. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A structure-guided hybridization approach using two privileged substructures gave instant access to a new series of tankyrase inhibitors. The identified inhibitor 16 displays high target affinity on tankyrase 1 and 2 with biochemical and cellular IC 50 values of 29 nM, 6.3 nM and 19 nM, respectively, and high selectivity toward other poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzymes. The identified inhibitor shows a favorable in vitro ADME profile as well as good oral bioavailability in mice, rats, and dogs. Critical for the approach was the utilization of an appropriate linker between 1,2,4-triazole and benzimidazolone moieties, whereby a cyclobutyl linker displayed superior affinity compared to a cyclohexane and phenyl linker. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Adenocarcinoma accounts for more than 40% of lung malignancy, and microscopic pathology evaluation is indispensable for its diagnosis. However, how histopathology findings relate to molecular abnormalities remains largely unknown. Here, we obtained H&E-stained whole-slide histopathology images, pathology reports, RNA sequencing, and proteomics data of 538 lung adenocarcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and used these to identify molecular pathways associated with histopathology patterns. We report cell-cycle regulation and nucleotide binding pathways underpinning tumor cell dedifferentiation, and we predicted histology grade using transcriptomics and proteomics signatures (area under curve >0.80). We built an integrative histopathology-transcriptomics model to generate better prognostic predictions for stage I patients (p = 0.0182 ± 0.0021) compared with gene expression or histopathology studies alone, and the results were replicated in an independent cohort (p = 0.0220 ± 0.0070). These results motivate the integration of histopathology and omics data to investigate molecular mechanisms of pathology findings and enhance clinical prognostic prediction. Integrative omics-histopathology analyses identified the gene and protein expression patterns associated with lung adenocarcinoma differentiation. Regularized machine-learning models using both transcriptomics and histopathology information better predicted the survival outcomes of stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients, with the results replicated in an independent cohort. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Killing of cancer cells by applying mechanical disruption has been an appealing emerging strategy for cancer treatment in recent years. In this study, photoresponsive submicron particles based on diazo-resin that are able to release N2 under UV irradiation were prepared through a polyamine-salt aggregation method. After surface modification with hyaluronic acid, the particles could be internalized selectively by cancer cells and were mainly located in lysosomes after 6 h incubation. The viability of cancer cells decreased obviously after they were co-cultured with photoresponsive particles and UV irradiation due to the integrity damage of lysosomes by phototriggered N2 generation and the subsequent increased number of reactive oxygen species. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) is nontoxic to normal cells and preferentially cytotoxic to cancer cells. Recent data suggest that malignant breast cancer cells often become resistant to TRAIL. Pterostilbene (PTER), a naturally occurring analogue of resveratrol found in blueberries, is known to induce cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. In the present study, we examined whether PTER affects TRAIL-induced apoptosis and its mechanism in TRAIL-resistant triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Our data indicated that PTER induced apoptosis (14.68 ± 3.78% for 40 μM PTER vs 1.98 ± 0.25% for control, p < 0.01) in TNBC cells and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant TNBC cells (18.45 ± 4.65% for 40 μM PTER vs 29.38 ± 6.35% for combination of 40 μM PTER and 100 ng/mL TRAIL, p < 0.01). We demonstrated that PTER induced death receptors DR5 and DR4 as well as decreased decoy receptor DcR-1 and DcR-2 expression. PTER also decreased the antiapoptotic proteins c-FLIPS/L, Bcl-Xl, Bcl-2, survivin, and XIAP. PTER induced the cleavage of bid protein and caused proapoptotic Bax accumulation. Moreover, we found that PTER induced the expression of DR4 and DR5 through the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/ endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/ERK 1/2 and p38/C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) signaling pathways. Overall, our results showed that PTER potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis via ROS-mediated CHOP activation leading to the expression of DR4 and DR5. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The Distress Thermometer (DT) was built and validated for screening cancer patients for distress, as suggested by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The current work was designed to measure the rates of distress in a sample of patients being hospitalized in a multidisciplinary outpatient surgery clinic. Objective: To measure the rates of distress in a sample of patients referring to a multidisciplinary day surgery division in a comprehensive cancer center based in Northern Italy. Methods: A total of 177 patients were asked to fill in the (DT) before surgery. Results: Out of 177 patients, 154 (87%) patients completed the DT. While 13% of the patients indicated a total absence of distress, more than half of the sample declared a moderate or high distress. A total of 55% of patients presented at least three difficulties in the Problem List Checklist. Distress was not correlated with age or other medical and clinical variables. Number of emotional problems was the best predictor of distress at admission (β = 0.655, ρ = 0.000). Conclusion: Screening for distress in a day surgery multidisciplinary oncology division is feasible and a relevant percentage of patients can be identified as clinically distressed. Outcomes also highlight the impact of age and precise physical and psycho-social signs as prognostic indicators of clinically significant distress. Measurement of distress and associated problems list represent the preliminary endpoint toward adequate recommendations that contribute to taking care of distress in cancer patients in cost-effective clinical setting. © 2016 Arnaboldi, Riva, Vadilonga, Tadini, Magon and Pravettoni.",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, we aimed at identifying the potential relationship between baseline alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and the adverse effects of docetaxel in breast cancer patients. A total of 87 breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel at a dose 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks as a single agent in adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Baseline AAG was determined at the day before usage of decetaxel in the first cycle. Febrile neutropenia, grade 3-4 stomatitis, grade 3-4 diarrhea and severe asthenia was determined as safety end points. Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Effects (CTCAE) V4.0 was used to evaluated the adverse effects during the first cycle of chemotherapy. The mean age of patients was 47.7±8.89 years. Mean baseline AAG was 0.99±0.24 g/L. Primary adverse effects during the chemotherapy was febrile neutropenia (30%), grade 3-4 stomatitis (17%), grade 3-4 diarrhea (23%), and severe asthenia (20%). Among those adverse effects, febrile neutropenia, grade 3-4 stomatitis and grade 3-4 diarrhea had shown significant association with mean difference of baseline AAG (P &lt; 0.01). Patients who developed febrile neutropenia (n = 26) had lower baseline AAG level of 0.838±0.192 g/L compared with 1.051±0.236 g/L in patients who did not experience such effect (n = 61). Also, the level of baseline AAG in patients who had grade 3-4 stomatitis (0.760±0.176 g/L) and grade 3-4 diarrhea 0.800±0.172 g/L) is lower than those who did not had these events. Baseline AAG is appears to be used as a predictive biomarker of adverse effects in breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel. © 2017 Journal of Chinese Pharmaceutical Sciences.",

    "Abstract": "Background: To assess the oncologic outcomes of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (Hypo-WBI). Methods: Eligible patients had undergone breast conservative surgery for early breast cancer (pTis-2) and none/limited nodal involvement. Hypo-WBI consisted of 34 Gy in 10 daily fractions over 2 weeks to the whole breast three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), followed by a single fraction of 8 Gy to the tumor bed after 1 week (electrons). Primary endpoint is freedom from ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Minimum follow up for living & event-free patients is 3 yrs.; median follow up time of the whole analyzed patient population is 5.4 yrs. (range: 1.8-11.4 yrs). Results: Two hundred fifty-one patients were accrued from 2004 to 2013. All patients underwent local excision of the primary tumor to negative margins. Four patients failed in the ipsilateral breast after a median time of 3.2 years (range: 1.7-5.7 yrs) for a 5-year IBTR-free survival of 98.7% (95%CI: 97.3%-100%). IBTR-free survival was significantly higher for patients with invasive cancer than for patients with intraductal carcinoma (p = 0.036). Within patients with invasive tumors, no clear trends or associations were detected between IBTR and age, grading, molecular subtype, pT or pN stage. At 5 years, the actuarial rates of GR2 fibrosis and GR2+ teleangectasia are 2.4% (95%CI: 0-6.5%) and 7.1% (95%CI: 0.4-13.7%), respectively. Cosmesis was scored as excellent/good by ≈95% of patients and ≈60% of clinicians. Conclusions: Hypo-WBI in 3 weeks allows excellent oncologic outcomes for invasive breast cancer after conservative surgery. Patients with intraductal carcinoma should be treated with Hypo-WBI only within a controlled study. Trial registration: IRE-IFO Ethical and Scientific Committee (cod.

    "Abstract": "Background: Tumour progression involves a series of phenotypic changes to cancer cells, each of which presents therapeutic targets. Here, using techniques adapted from microbial experimental evolution, we investigate the evolution of tumour spreading - a precursor for metastasis and tissue invasion - in environments with varied resource supply. Evolutionary theory predicts that competition for resources within a population will select for individuals to move away from a natal site (i.e. disperse), facilitating the colonisation of unexploited resources and decreasing competition between kin. Results: After approximately 100 generations in environments with low resource supply, we find that MCF7 breast cancer spheroids (small in vitro tumours) show increased spreading. Conversely, spreading slows compared to the ancestor where resource supply is high. Common garden experiments confirm that the evolutionary responses differ between selection lines; with lines evolved under low resource supply showing phenotypic plasticity in spheroid spreading rate. These differences in spreading behaviour between selection lines are heritable (stable across multiple generations), and show that the divergently evolved lines differ in their response to resource supply. Conclusions: We observe dispersal-like behaviour and an increased sensitivity to resource availability in our selection lines, which may be a response to selection, or alternatively may be due to epigenetic changes, provoked by prolonged resource limitation, that have persisted across many cell generations. Different clinical strategies may be needed depending on whether or not tumour progression is due to natural selection. This study highlights the effectiveness of experimental evolution approaches in cancer cell populations and demonstrates how simple model systems might enable us to observe and measure key selective drivers of clinically important traits. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have drawn considerable research interest owing to their unique emission properties. However, the environment surrounding the NC greatly influences its luminous behavior. In this work, a novel nanocomposite based on AuNCs with bright fluorescence and high biocompatibility was prepared. In this nanocomposite, mesoporous silica nanospheres provided a mesoporous framework, which helped to template the formation of ultrasmall AuNCs and also prevented their aggregation in different solutions. These nanocomposites emitted stable fluorescence even in complex biological environments. After the self-assembly of folic acid-conjugated poly(l-lysine), the presence of folic acid on the nanocomposites guaranteed a good recognition in folate receptor (FR)-positive cells, improving detection selectivity. Cellular experiments demonstrated that the nanocomposites had good dispersity in the physiological environment and could be internalized by FR-positive cancer cells, resulting in bright fluorescence. We believe that this research provides a simple approach to the fabrication of stable fluorescent AuNC nanocomposites, which show good compatibility with complex biological systems and great potential for applications in biological imaging and cell detection. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "An amphiphilic supramolecular brush copolymer CB[8]⊃(PEG-Np·PTPE) was constructed on the basis of a novel host-guest molecular recognition model formed by cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), 4,4′-bipyridinium derivative, and PEGylated naphthol (PEG-Np). In aqueous solution, the resultant supramolecular brush copolymer self-assembled into supramolecular nanoparticles (SNPs), by which the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was encapsulated in the hydrophobic core, establishing an artful Förster resonance energy transfer system with dual fluorescence quenched. With the help of intracellular reducing agents and low pH environment, the SNPs disassembled and the loaded drug molecules were released, realizing in situ visualization of the drug release via the location and magnitude of the energy transfer-dependent fluorescence variation. The cytotoxicity evaluation indicated DOX-loaded SNPs effectively inhibited cell proliferation against HeLa cells. Animal experiments demonstrated that these DOX-loaded SNPs highly accumulated in tumor tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention effect and also had a long blood circulation time. These multifunctional supramolecular nanoparticles possessing self-imaging and controllable drug release ability exhibited great potential in cancer therapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Because of the nontargeting release of anticancer drugs, conventional chemotherapy results in serious side effects and poor therapeutic outcomes. In addition, hypoxia situation in the tumor microenvironment also promotes the growth and metastasis of tumors. Multifunctional nanocarriers with stimuli-activation and hypoxia-relieving properties can help overcome some of these limitations. In this study, we have constructed a nanocarrier which is named PBMn-DOX@RBC. A Prussian blue/manganese dioxide (PBMn) nanoparticle is used as an oxygen precursor or catalyzer for H 2 O 2 activation, and a red blood cell (RBC) membrane is used to increase the loading capacity of doxorubicin (DOX) and prolong the circulation time in vivo. H 2 O 2 is overproduced in tumor tissues and tumor cells. It can be used as a stimulus to activate drug release. In the presence of H 2 O 2 , the hypoxia inside the tumors is relieved by the administration of PBMn-DOX@RBC. The generated oxygen disrupts the RBC coated on the surface of PBMn, which accelerates the release of DOX. RBCs also prolong the circulation time of the nanometer system in vivo. By combining the photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemotherapy, the tumor growth inhibition mediated by PBMn-DOX@RBC is further enhanced. PBMn-DOX@RBC fulfills the demands to relieve tumor hypoxia and enhance cancer chemotherapy/PTT. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The diterpenoid ester ingenol mebutate (IngMeb) is the active ingredient in the topical drug Picato, a first-in-class treatment for the precancerous skin condition actinic keratosis. IngMeb is proposed to exert its therapeutic effects through a dual mode of action involving (i) induction of cell death that is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction followed by (ii) stimulation of a local inflammatory response, at least partially driven by protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Although this therapeutic model has been well characterized, the complete set of molecular targets responsible for mediating IngMeb activity remains ill-defined. Here, we have synthesized a photoreactive, clickable analogue of IngMeb and used this probe in quantitative proteomic experiments to map several protein targets of IngMeb in human cancer cell lines and primary human keratinocytes. Prominent among these targets was the mitochondrial carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase SLC25A20, which we show is inhibited in cells by IngMeb and the more stable analogue ingenol disoxate (IngDsx), but not by the canonical PKC agonist 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). SLC25A20 blockade by IngMeb and IngDsx leads to a buildup of cellular acylcarnitines and blockade of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), pointing to a possible mechanism for IngMeb-mediated perturbations in mitochondrial function. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Dysregulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. As a result of their essential role in regulating protein tyrosine phosphorylation levels, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have emerged as important yet challenging therapeutic targets. Here we report on the development and application of a glutathione-responsive motif to facilitate the efficient intracellular delivery of a novel class of selenosulfide phosphatase inhibitors for the selective active site directed inhibition of the targeted PTP by selenosulfide exchange with the active site cysteine. The strategy leverages the large difference in extracellular and intracellular glutathione levels to deliver selenosulfide phosphatase inhibitors to cells. As an initial exploration of the prodrug platform and the corresponding selenosulfide covalent inhibitor class, potent and selective inhibitors were developed for two therapeutically relevant PTP targets: the Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence factor mPTPA and the CNS-specific tyrosine phosphatase, striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). The lead selenosulfide inhibitors enable potent and selective inhibition of their respective targets over a panel of human PTPs and a representative cysteine protease. Kinetic parameters of the inhibitors were characterized, including reversibility of inhibition and rapid rate of GSH exchange at intracellular GSH concentrations. Additionally, active site covalent inhibitor-labeling with an mPTPA inhibitor was rigorously confirmed by mass spectrometry, and cellular activity was demonstrated with a STEP prodrug inhibitor in cortical neurons. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",
