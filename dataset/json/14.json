    "Abstract": "Background: Conventional laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy procedures have inherent limitations such as restricted movement of straight forceps and tremor of the tip of the devices that can potentially be overcome using robotic distal gastrectomy (RDG). This single-institutional phase II trial aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of RDG with lymph node dissection for clinical stage IA gastric cancer. Methods: The study included patients with clinical stage IA gastric cancer in the lower two-thirds of the stomach considered to be curatively resected via distal gastrectomy. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who developed intra-abdominal complications, requiring medical or interventional treatment. The planned sample size was 25, calculated based on an expected complication rate of 3% and a threshold complication rate of 15%, with a one-sided alpha of 10%, power of 70%. Results: Overall postoperative complications rate was 16%. The proportion of patients who developed intra-abdominal complications, requiring treatment was 0% (90% confidence interval, 0–9.8%). No patient developed in-hospital adverse events of grade 3 or higher. The short-term clinical outcomes were as follows: the median duration of postoperative hospital stay was 7 d, and 10 patients (40.0%) had a body temperature of 38°C or higher during their hospital stay. Conclusions: This trial confirmed the safety of RDG with limitation by the restriction of dedicated surgeons. A phase III trial to confirm the superiority of RDG to conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is warranted. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "KRAS G12D point mutation plays an important role in the incidence of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer. Here, we developed a novel anchor-like DNA (alDNA) electrochemical sensor for the detection of KRAS point mutation level (the concentration ratio of the specific KRAS point mutant DNA (M-DNA) to the total DNA (t-DNA) of both mutant and wild-type DNAs carrying the same allele). Compared to those conventional ligation-based DNA sensors, the proposed alDNA sensor achieved the one-step capture of both wild-type and mutant DNA, and the subsequent detection on one chip, which effectively decreased systematic errors from the uncertain differences on the interfacial structural and microenvironmental changes, improved the detection accuracy. Also, with the usage of formamide-NaCl solution, the whole detection process including the denaturation of double-stranded DNA was performed under mild temperature conditions (~40 °C). It greatly decreased the cost and improved the reproducibility and feasibility of the method. Based on it, the linear correlations with the logarithm of concentration in wide range from 0.1 pM to 10 nM for t-DNA and from 100 pM to 10 nM for M-DNA were achieved, respectively. The analysis of t-DNA- and M-DNA-spiked human serum samples revealed the high accuracy of the method. This alDNA sensor is convenient, low-cost and time-saving, with broad dynamic range, high sensitivity and selectivity. It can meet the demands of the clinical detection on the KRAS point mutation level in blood samples, which means significant for the earlier NSCLC diagnosis, individualized treatment, and therapeutic efficacy evaluation. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major public health problem and research using cell culture models has improved understanding of this disease. The human cervix contains three anatomic regions; ectocervix with stratified squamous epithelium, endocervix with secretory epithelium, and transformation zone (TZ) with metaplastic cells. Most cervical cancers originate within the TZ. However, little is known about the biology of TZ cells or why they are highly susceptible to carcinogenesis. The goal of this study was to develop and optimize methods to compare growth and differentiation of cells cultured from ectocervix, TZ or endocervix. We examined the effects of different serum-free media on cell attachment, cell growth and differentiation, and cell population doublings in monolayer culture. We also optimized conditions for organotypic culture of cervical epithelial cells using collagen rafts with human cervical stromal cells. Finally, we present a step-by-step protocol for culturing cells from each region of human cervix. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Although platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard-of-care for most patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), acquired resistance occurs frequently predicting poor prognosis. To examine the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance, we have generated and characterized by proteomic approach the resistant A549 CDDP-resistant (CPr-A549) and their parental A549 cells, identifying 15 proteins differentially expressed (13 upregulated and 2 downregulated in CPr-A549). In details, we highlighted a coherent network of proteins clustering together and involved in altered protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum stress, correlated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition process and cancer stem cell markers, where vimentin played a hierarchical role, ultimately resulting in increased aggressive features. By using publicly available databases we showed that the modulated proteins could contribute to NSCLC carcinogenesis and correlate with NSCLC patients prognosis and survival probability, suggesting that they can be used as novel potential prognostic/predictive biomarkers or therapeutic targets to overcome platinum-resistance. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The use of laparoscopy in the treatment and management of advanced ovarian cancer is increasing among the gynaecologic oncologists. The development of port site metastases after laparoscopy is a concern and a matter of debate due to theoretical iatrogenic disease spread. Port site resection (PSR) has been proposed as an option to avoid this scenario. Material and methods: One hundred and twenty-three patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO III-IV) and with diagnostic laparoscopy were included and after cytoreductive surgery were classified into two groups: no port site resection (No-PSR) and port site resection (PSR). Based on the pathological results of all port site specimens, PSR was classified as positive port site metastasis (PSM+) and negative port site metastasis (PSM-). Results: In 82 cases, the laparoscopic port site access was resected in the debulking surgery. At the final specimen examination, 49% presented as PSM+. No statistical differences regarding survival were found, either between the No-PSR and PSR groups (p = 0.28) or between the PSM+ and PSM - groups (p = 0.92). A higher wound complication rate was found in the PSR group (17% vs. 34%; p = 0.047). The RR (Relative Risk) of wound events for PSR was 2.42 (95% CI 1.09–5.35; p = 0.0296). Conclusions: To date, not only there is no data supporting PSR after laparoscopy in advanced ovarian cancer, but the role of PSM+ in prognosis also remains unclear. In patients in which laparoscopy is performed prior to the debulking procedure, the PSR may not be recommended in those cases of no macroscopic port site metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "With the objective of finding an avenue for development of magnetic nanomaterials which were incorporated into cells for induction of cell death in human cancerous cell lines, an environmental friendly synthesis method was investigated. The present work aimed to synthesis magnetic NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO nanoparticles by a novel, simple, environmental friendly and cost effective method in the presence of Dactylopius Coccus. The ultra-fine NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO ceramic nanocomposites (NNC) were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) as well as vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) used to study the magnetic properties of NNC nanoparticles. MTT cytotoxicity assay performed to determine the anti-proliferative effect of NNC nanoparticles against 4T1 breast cancer cell lines. The results demonstrated that the NNC nanoparticles meaningfully reduced the survival percentage of the 4T1 cells of the murine invasive breast cancer with an IC 50 was of 4 mg/ml. The dominant mechanism of cell death was apoptosis, along with an increase in cellular oxidative stress. Consequently, based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO nanoparticles can potentially be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is one of the most concerned diseases in the world, where there is still no reported specifically targeted drugs with high effect. In this study, mesoporous silica with a large pore size of 25.25 nm and magnetic cores was prepared as a carrier of doxorubicin for anti-cancer drug delivery. Besides its superior biocompatibility properties and functional surface, the large mesopores provided enough space for multiple chemical modification and in-situ growth of Au nanoparticles. Amino groups were grafted on the inner mesopores to capture the drug molecules via complexation. Cooperated with the steric hindrance of β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the external surface, a perfect response to acid environment was established. Meanwhile, the presence of magnetic cores and Au nanoparticles gave the system sensitive response to both alternating magnetic field (AMF) and near infrared ray (NIR). What's more, the combination of magnetic cores and Au nanoparticles provided a strong medical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal with a linear correlation of 0.9946. The accurate dose related NMR signal and the multi-stimuli sensitive response, including pH, AMF and NIR, make this system immense potential for imaging diagnosis and targeted drug delivery therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The authors present the case of a patient who after undergoing craniotomy for glioblastoma resection was found to have gliosarcoma recurrence in the subdural space without intraparenchymal recurrence. A 74-year old man originally presented with the first seizure of his life and was found to have a right temporal glioblastoma multiforme. He underwent craniotomy and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Five months later, he presented with what was to be presumed to be a right subdural hematoma found on surveillance imaging. After expanding on repeat imaging, the patient was electively taken for burr hole evacuation, however intraoperatively thickened membranes were encountered leading to craniotomy and resection of lesion with pathology consistent with gliosarcoma. What we describe is novel because not only was there rare subdural spread of previously resected glioblastoma observed, but also transformation to the more aggressive tumor of gliosarcoma. Thus, we add to the body of literature and evidence to the clinical consideration of glioma as a rare cause of non-traumatic subdural collection. Specifically in a population of patients who have already undergone glioma resections, work up of subdural collections should include contrasted MRI beyond CT. The treatment paradigm does not change in this presentation of glioma recurrence. Surgical decompression and resection to alleviate brain compression, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in the global population and remains difficult to treat mainly because of the absence of targeted drug delivery stages and restrictions related with delivery of drugs to deep lung tissues. The aim of the present study was to develop a noninvasive, patient-convenient formulation for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells located in the deep lung tissue. A PEGylated paramagnetic hollow-nanosphere was fabricated, fully characterized and used as a nanocarrier for pulmonary co-delivery of Doxorubicin (DOX) and Methotrexate (MTX). In first step, magnetic-silica nanoparticles were synthesized and then coated with amino/acrylate groups and derivatized with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Finally, silica was removed to provide hollow structured nanoparticles. The biocompatibility of blank carriers and the efficiency of MTX-DOX-loaded carriers were also approved by MTT assay and DAPI staining. The aerosolization performance of nanoparticles embedded microspheres were assessed by next generation impactor. The almost natural zeta potential and obvious decrease in silica content observed by EDX and removal of intense silica characteristic peak at FTIR analyses approved the successful removal of silica layer and preparation of hollow-nanospheres. The successful PEGylation of multilayer magnetic hollow-nanospheres catalyzed by boric acid was confirmed by presence of amide groups in FTIR spectra. The developed polymeric nanoparticle showed quite appropriate loading capacity for both DOX and MTX (48%) because of designing adequate negatively and positively charged sites for both drugs. The cytotoxicity assays proved the safety of blank nanoparticles and efficacy of drugs-loaded nanoparticles on lung cancer A549 cell lines. The developed dry powder inhalation formulation of nanoparticles showed appropriate aerosolization performance (fine particle fraction around 22%). It was concluded that these outcomes may open the potentials for efficient pulmonary co-delivery of MTX and DOX to the carcinogenic tissues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lymph node involvement is a fundamental prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Lymph node yield (LNY), which is the number of lymph nodes retrieved after neck dissection, and lymph node ratio (LNR), which is the ratio of positive lymph nodes out of the total removed, are measurable indicators that may have the potential to be used as prognostic factors. The present study is designed to define the exact role of LNY and LNR regarding the overall and specific survival of patients affected by oral cavity and oropharyngeal SCC. It has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov database (NCT03534778). Methods: This is a multicenter study involving tertiary care referral centers in Europe and North America. Patients affected by oral cavity, HPV+ and HPV- oropharyngeal SCC undergoing neck dissection will be consecutively enrolled and followed-up for up to 5 years. Patients and disease characteristic will be properly recorded and centrally analyzed. The primary end-point is to define reliable cut off-values for LNY and LNR which may serve as prognosticators of survival. This will be achieved through the use of ROC curves. Secondary outcomes will be the Overall survival (OS), Disease Specific Survival (DSS), and Progression Free Survival Hazard Ratios (HR) at 2-, 3- and 5 years, which will be evaluated through the Kaplan-Meier method and the difference in survival attested by the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis will be performed to understand the association of various outcomes with LNY and LNR. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been revealed as interesting antitumor agents inhibiting the action of Sox2 transcription factor, which reduces the risk of metastasis during hormonal therapies. However, they have shown serious concerns to be incorporated into the cells due to their cytotoxicity. Taking this into consideration, this study aims to develop polyoxometalate-based nanocarriers to be potentially applied as new forms of anticancer therapies. Thus, the Wells-Dawson type [P 2 Mo 18 O 62 ] 6− phosphomolybdate was physically loaded into covalently crosslinked chitosan nanogels that can act as nanocarriers for local delivery. The obtained nanocomposites were extensively characterized by 31 P-NMR, TEM microscopy, DLS and zeta potential measurements. This work revealed that selected chitosan nanocarriers would present great potential for POM delivery into tumoral cells due to their pH-triggered deliverability that inhibits cytotoxic drug release at physiological pH. Furthermore, the high uptakes values reported herein make prepared nanocomposites interesting candidates for future breast antitumoral treatments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of epithelial breast malignancy, and chemoresistance is the major obstacle for cancer therapy. TNBC is associated with a hypoxic phenotype, and hypoxia contributes to the chemoresistance in breast cancer. Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tDRs) represent a new class of small noncoding RNAs that can be induced specifically by hypoxia. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of the aberrant expression of tDRs in hypoxia-treated TNBC cell lines through the use of high-throughput sequencing technique. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the differently expressed tDRs between two samples. The results showed that tDR-0009 [derived from transfer RNA (tRNA) Gly-GCC-1-1 ] and tDR-7336 (derived from tRNA Gly-GCC-1–2 ) were significantly upregulated when the SUM-1315 cell lines were stimulated by hypoxia. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis indicated that these two upregulated tDRs were mainly involved in maintenance of stem cell population and cellular response to interleukin (IL)-6, which may be the underlying mechanism of hypoxia-induced tDRs that facilitate the doxorubicin resistance in TNBC. The protein–protein interaction network for predicted target genes established by the STRING database manifested that tDR-0009 (tDR-7336) might be involved in the chemoresistance of TNBC via regulation of the activation of phosphorylation of STAT3. In summary, our study provided a comprehensive analysis of the deviant expression profiling of tDRs in hypoxia-treated TNBC cell lines. Specific tDRs may be a new class of regulatory factors involved in the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in TNBC, and they could serve as potential biomarkers and intervention targets. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose/objective: Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) regimens for prostate cancer are emerging, but tolerance doses for late adverse events are scarce. The purpose of this study is to define dose–volume predictors for late gastrointestinal and genitourinary (GI and GU) toxicities after HRT in the multi-center NRG Oncology/RTOG 0415 low-risk prostate cancer trial (N = 521). Material/methods: Treatment in the studied HRT arm was delivered as 70 Gy at 2.5 Gy/fraction with 3D-CRT/IMRT (N = 108/413). At a median follow-up of 5.9 years, the crude late ≥Grade 2 GI and GU toxicities were 19% and 29%, respectively. For modeling, the complete HRT cohort was randomly split into training and validation (70% and 30%; preserved toxicity rates). Within training, dose–response modeling was based on dose–volume cut-points (EQD2Gy; bladder/rectum: α/β = 6 Gy/3Gy), age, acute ≥Grade 2 toxicity, and treatment technique using univariate and multivariate logistic regression on bootstrapping (UVA and MVA). Candidate predictors were determined at p ≤ 0.05, and the selected MVA models were explored on validation where model generalizability was judged if the area under the receiver-operating curve in validation (AUC validation ) was within AUC training ± SD with p ≤ 0.05, and with an Hosmer–Lemeshow p-value (p HL ) &gt; 0.05. Results: Three candidate predictors were suggested for late GI toxicity: the minimum dose to the hottest 5% rectal volume (D5%[Gy]), the absolute rectal volume &lt;35 Gy, and acute GI toxicity (AUC = 0.59–0.63; p = 0.02–0.04). The two generalizable MVA models, i.e., D5%[Gy] with or without acute GI toxicity (AUC validation = 0.64, 0.65; p = 0.01, 0.03; p HL = 0.45–0.56), suggest that reducing late GI toxicity from 20% to 10% would require reducing D5%[Gy] from ≤65 Gy to ≤62 Gy (logistic function argument: 17+(0.24D5%[Gy])). Acute GU toxicity showed only a trend to predict late GU toxicity (AUC training = 0.57; p = 0.07). Conclusion: Late GI toxicity, following moderate HRT for low-risk prostate cancer, increases with higher doses to small rectal volumes. This work provides quantitative evidence that limiting small rectal dose ‘hotspots’ in clinical practice of such HRT regimens is likely to further reduce the associated rates of GI toxicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Applications of fibrous meshes for localized chemotherapy have been limited by the lack of optimal carriers that are capable of releasing sufficient drug locally. To overcome this obstacle, we introduced Pluronic F127 (PF127) to the camptothecin (CPT)-loaded poly(lactic acid/glycolic acid) (PLGA) electrospun fibrous meshes, abbreviated as PPC, for modulation of drug release. These PPC meshes had smooth surface and high drug loading (5.6–6.8%). Addition of PF127 obviously improved the hydrophilicity of the meshes. Interestingly, the CPT release rate of PPC meshes was significantly higher than that of CPT-loaded PLGA (PLGA-CPT) meshes. Most importantly, incorporation of PF127 in the meshes led to significant reduction in the CT-26 viability compared to PLGA-CPT mesh. The improved anticancer effects of PPC meshes were mainly due to the induction of apoptosis in CT-26 cells. These findings suggest that PPC mesh could be a promising implantable system that may enhance the therapeutic efficacy and prevent tumor recurrence after surgical resection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Spherical micro-mesoporous silicon (mSi) particles were fabricated by thermal decomposition of monosilane (SiH 4 ) within the mesopores of monodisperse silica particles (MSP) and subsequent etching out of the template material. The thermal destruction of SiH 4 occurs within the whole pore volume uniformly because in the thermal chemical vapor deposition method we developed, the limiting stage of the process in which MSP pores are filled with silicon is the reaction in which monosilane is decomposed, rather than its diffusion within template mesopores. The porosity of the mSi particles synthesized can be varied without changes in the shape and outer diameter of the particles by varying the parameters of the technological process of silane decomposition. The particles have large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (250–350 m 2 g −1 ) and pore volume (0.3–0.5 cm 3 g −1 ). For the first time the obtained submicron spherical porous silicon particles are monodisperse with a size scatter not exceeding 10%, which provides the identity of their hydrodynamic and adsorption properties so important for biomedical applications. We introduced the cytostatic drug doxorubicin (DOX) into mSi pores by the physical adsorption method. It was shown that DOX is desorbed from the mSi pores and penetrates into K-562 cancer cells, with local DOX concentration maxima observed in the intracellular space. The cytotoxicity of the mSi and mSi/DOX particles was studied, and the inhibition capacities of the cancer-cell proliferation by doxorubicin adsorbed by mSi particles and a DOX solution were compared in vitro. It was shown that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) is four times lower under the action of DOX-loaded mSi particles as compared with free doxorubicin. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To describe the genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) late toxicity profile and to analyse the clinical and dosimetry outcomes predictors of the combination of EBRT and high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy (BT) for localized prostate cancer. Materials and methods: Between January 2012 and May 2017, 210 patients were included in a prospective protocol. Treatment consisted in HDR-BT (15 Gy single fraction) plus 3DCRT (37.5 Gy/15 fractions). Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyse the impact of variables on late toxicity. Results: Median age was 71 (56–82), 12.4% of patients had low, 44.3% intermediate and 41% high-risk prostate cancer. Median prostate volume was 28.4 cc. Median V100, V150, V200 were 98.2%, 27% and 7.4% respectively. Median urethra Dmax, rectum D1cc and D2cc, were 113.5%, 62.2%% and 54.2% respectively. After a median follow-up of 41 months (5–75) late G2 GU and GI late toxicity was observed in 14.8% and 5.2% of patients respectively. Late G3 GU and GI toxicity occurred in 0% and 1% of patients respectively. There were no outcome correlations with late G ≥ 2 GU toxicity on univariate analysis. Previous cardiovascular comorbidity (p = 0.042), and dose to the rectum D2cc (p = 0.016) and D1cc (p = 0.017) were associated with G ≥ 2 GI toxicity. Multivariate analysis showed that rectum D1cc (HR11.56; 95%CI 1.4–92.1; p = 0.021) and prior history of cardiovascular disease (HR3.6; 95%CI 1–12.9; p = 0.045) remained independent predictors of G ≥ 2 GI toxicity. Conclusions: There is a low incidence of late GU and GI morbidity using single fraction HDR-BT and hypofractionated EBRT. Previous cardiovascular disease and dose to the rectum were observed to correlate with GI toxicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Two series of sulfonylpiperazines linked [1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]chromenones were synthesized featuring phenyl (7a-k) and chalcone (12a-k) bridge representing flavones or homoisoflavonoids core. New molecules are synthesized utilizing aldol condensation to inspect as antioxidants against DPPH [rad] and ABTS [rad]+ and antiproliferative agents toward selected human cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity of new compounds was confirmed using SRB assay against non-cancer MDCK cell line. The results concluded that both individual structures of 7 and 12 were vital for modulating pharmacological potencies and presence of different electron withdrawing and electron donating functional group(s) on the phenylsulfonyl entity yielded varied biological effects. Substituent h (OCF 3 ) and j, k (OCH 3 ) were found to play a crucial role scavenging DPPH [rad] and ABTS [rad]+ as well as inhibiting cancer cell lines SK-OV-3 and HT-29. Moreover, molecules bearing halogen atom(s) such as substituent b-g expressed excellent inhibitory potential against HeLa and A-549 cancerous cell lines. Bioassay data displayed some interesting structure-activity relationships which are discussed in this paper. The results justified that tested derivatives are promising antioxidants and cytotoxic agents and warrant further structural optimization and bioassay studies. Spectroscopic techniques such as FT-IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and elemental analysis (CHN) were carried out to confirm the final structures. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this study, an HER2 aptamer-decorated curcumin-loaded human serum albumin nanoparticle (Apt-HSA/CCM NP) was developed and characterized as a new anticancer formulation for targeted delivery to human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing breast cancer cells. Conjugation of HER2 Apt to the surface of HSA NPs was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and FTIR analysis. The obtained NPs have the hydrodynamic diameter of 281.1 ± 11.1 nm and zeta potential of −33.3 ± 2.5 mV. The data demonstrated that encapsulation of curcumin in HSA NPs by desolvation method has increased water solubility by 400 folds. Fluorescent microscopy image demonstrated remarkable cytoplasmic uptake of Apt-HSA/CCM NPs in HER2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells compared to unconjugated counterparts. Cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated no significant difference between cytotoxic effect of free curcumin and non-targeted HSA/CCM NPs in both HER2 positive and HER2 negative cell lines. However, the toxicity of Apt-HSA/CCM NPs was significantly higher and cell viability reached 36% after 72 h in SK-BR3 cell line. These results suggest that this targeted delivery system has the potential to be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of HER2 positive cancer cells. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue is a common cancer of the oral region, generally occurring on the lateral surface of the tongue. Case report: We present a case of SCC of the dorsum of the tongue along with the development of two other primary cancers with different histologies in a 61-year-old Japanese woman, who presented with a mass on the dorsum of her tongue in 2017. Intraoral examination revealed a 2.5 × 1.5-cm tumor on the dorsum of the tongue without induration and covered with normal epithelium. She was previously diagnosed with carcinoma in an adenoma of the duodenum in 2013 and adenocarcinoma of the right lung in 2016. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no evidence of malignant tumors in the head and neck region. The lesion of the tongue was surgically excised with a safe margin. Histological examination revealed well-differentiated SCCs that were completely excised. Discussion: This is a rare case of three primary cancers with different histologies in one patient. Clinicians should consider SCC of the dorsum of the tongue during diagnosis, since it is a rare region and the tumor may mimic benign tumors. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Our study was aimed to investigate the effect of cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (CASC2) on the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods: CASC2 expression in tumor tissues and HCC cells was tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. After manipulating the expression of CASC2 in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, cells viability, including proliferation, apoptosis, cell-cycle distribution, migration, and invasion were examined by colony formation assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing assay, and transwell assay, respectively. The expression levels of proteins associated with the cell cycle and AKT/mTOR pathway were measured by the western blot. Stably transfected HepG2 cells were used to construct nude mice models, and tumorigenesis was evaluated to investigate the in vivo functions of CASC2 in HCC progression. Results: In tissues and cells of HCC, decreased CASC2 expressions were confirmed. Overexpression of CASC2 made cell cycle stagnated at G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, the overexpression of CASC2 played significant roles in inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, In vivo experiment indicated that CASC2 restrained the growth of tumors. Conclusion: Our study suggested that CASC2 promoted cell apoptosis and suppressed cell growth and metastasis in HCC, indicating that CASC2 might be a useful biomarker of HCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The molecular weight of a polymer always influences the outcome of any drug delivery system. In this milieu, understanding the effect of molecular weight of polymer in designing an effective drug delivery system has caught a significant attention. Here, in this study, we have systematically examined the effects of molecular weights of metal-free fully alternating semi-aromatic polyester made up of commercially available tert-butyl glycidyl ether (tBGE) and phthalic anhydride (PA) monomers (poly(tBGE-alt-PA) copolymer) to design an efficient drug delivery system for cancer therapy. The molecular weights of such polyester greatly influenced the encapsulation efficiency, drug loading capacity, in vitro drug release profile and intracellular drug uptake of different nano-drug carriers, which finally determined its drug delivery efficiency. The anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy of all nano-drug carriers was tested on MIA PaCa-2 cells and maximum cytotoxicity was exhibited in case of poly(tBGE-alt-PA)-DOX nanoparticles of Mn = 9.2 kDa with low IC 50 value. These results were further corroborated with colony forming unit data, where maximum inhibition in MIA PaCa-2 cell proliferation was also found in case of low molecular weight DOX nanoparticles. Hence, we proved that poly(tBGE-alt-PA) copolymer of Mn = 9.2 kDa can be used further in the broader applications of drug delivery. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Mucin1 (MUC1), a member of the mucin family, is a glycoprotein which is often expressed in malignant cells. However, the expression and function of MUC1 in human duodenal adenocarcinoma (DAC) has not yet been characterized because of its low frequency. Here, we examined the functional roles of core protein (MUC1-C) in DAC. Materials and methods: Using a human duodenal cancer cell line, HuTu80, proliferation, migration, invasion, ALDH activity was assessed by cell counting kit–8, scratch wound healing, matrigel invasion, and ALDEFUOR assays, respectively. The function of MUC1 protein was evaluated with knockdown using specific siRNA as well as anti-MUC1-C peptide, GO203. MUC1 expression in human DAC was evaluated immunohistochemically in surgically resected tumors. Results: The positive expression of MUC1 in HuTu80 was confirmed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. In vitro cell growth was inhibited by the addition of 50-100 μM GO203 as well as treatment with siRNA for MUC1-C. Silencing of MUC1-C also significantly reduced migration, invasion, ALDH activity. Local injection of GO-203 (14 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous HuTu80 tumors in nude mice. Immunohistochemically, MUC1 was strongly detected in seven DAC cases, but not in 11 others. The outcome of patients with high MUC1 expression was significantly worse than those without MUC1 expression. Conclusions: These results suggest that MUC1 is functionally associated with the malignant potential of DAC and could be a novel therapeutic target for this rare tumor. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Persistent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a prerequisite for cervical cancer development. Few studies investigated clearance of high-risk HPV in low-and-middle-income countries. Our study investigated HPV clearance and persistence over four years in women from North Tongu District, Ghana. In 2010/2011, cervical swabs of 500 patients were collected and HPV genotyped (nested multiplex PCR) in Accra, Ghana. In 2014, 104 women who previously tested positive for high-risk HPV and remained untreated were re-tested for HPV. Cytobrush samples were genotyped (GP5+/6+ PCR & Luminex-MPG readout) in Berlin, Germany. Positively tested patients underwent colposcopy and treatment if indicated. Of 104 women, who tested high-risk HPV+ in 2010/2011, seven (6,7%; 95%CI: 2.7–13.4%) had ≥1 persistent high-risk‐infection after ~4 years (mean age 39 years). Ninety-seven (93,3%; 95%CI: 86.6–97.3%) had cleared the original infection, while 22 (21.2%; 95%CI: 13.8–30.3%) had acquired new high-risk infections with other genotypes. Persistent types found were HPV 16, 18, 35, 39, 51, 52, 58, and 68. Among those patients, one case of CIN2 (HPV 68) and one micro-invasive cervical cancer (HPV 16) were detected. This longitudinal observational data suggest that single HPV screening rounds may lead to over-referral. Including type-specific HPV re-testing or additional triage methods could help reduce follow-up rates. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer death worldwide. Resection offers the best chance of long-term survival, but a consistent adverse prognostic factor is the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI). In this study, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS), a high throughput method of analyzing complex samples, was used to explore differentially expressed proteins between HCC and adjacent nontumour liver tissue (ANLT). These findings were correlated with clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: From 2002 to 2011, tumor and ANLT were collected from patients who underwent liver resection and these samples were later prepared for SELDI-TOF MS. Output data were then used to identify proteins capable of discriminating HCC from ANLT. Proteins from the multivariate analysis were then analyzed to determine prognostic factors and the m/z ratios of these proteins were entered into the ExPASy database to infer potential candidates. Results: During the study period, 30 patients had SELDI-TOF MS performed on their HCC and ANLT samples. On multivariate analysis, a panel of four proteins—m/z 5840, m/z 8921, m/z 9961, and m/z 25,872—discriminated HCC from ANLT with an area under the ROC curve of 0.954 (P < 0.001). On prognostic factor assessment, decreased m/z 9961 was significantly associated with the presence of MVI (P = 0.025) and shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.045) in our patients. A potential candidate for this protein was coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, isoform 3 (CAR 3/7), which helps maintain tight junction integrity. Conclusions: Using SELDI TOF-MS, we identified a panel of four proteins with excellent discriminative capacity between HCC and ANLT. Of these, m/z 9961 was the only protein significantly associated with a known poor prognostic factor (presence of MVI) and survival (shorter disease-free survival). While loss of CAR 3/7 could lead to MVI, further research is warranted to validate the identity of protein m/z 9961. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Oral cancer represents the third most prevalent form of malignancy in developing countries and the eight most common form of cancer in developed countries. Alcohol and tobacco users are most affected by oral cancers and 90% of them are OSCC in adult males. In some provinces in Iran such as Sistan and Baluchestan, its prevalence is higher compared to other provinces. One of the primary neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is systemic glutamate, which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter. Glutamate signaling has been involved in various non-neuronal cancer processes. The aim of this research was to highlight the association between DNA methylation of the glutamate receptor genes and their expression pattern in pathogenesis of OSCC. Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from 83 OSCC paraffin-embedded tissues (mean age: 59.67 ± 16.08) and 80 normal samples (mean age: 50.15 ± 16.69). Promoter methylation status of glutamate receptors including GRM5, GRM2 and GRIA3 genes were carried out by Methylation Specific PCR technique (MSP). We also investigated the mRNA expression levels of these genes in 15 paraffin-embedded patients and healthy samples using real-time PCR techniques. Result: DNA methylation analysis showed statistically significant differences in the cases in comparison with healthy controls. Our data showed that the promoters of GRM2 and GRIA3 were methylated in the cases. For GRM2 (MM: OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.02–3.90; p-value =.37; MU: OR = 8.0; 95% CI = 1.37–47.34; p-value =.02) and GRIA3 (MM: OR = 47.19; 95% CI = 4.61–483.0; p-value =.001; MU: OR = 1.45; 95% CI = 0.35–5.89; p-value =.6). However, methylation of GRM5 promoter was not statistically different in the cases and healthy controls, GRM5 (MM: OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.14–5.71; p- value = 0.9; MU: OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 0.33–10.09; p-value =.4). In addition, the evaluation of mRNA expression levels of GRM2, GRIA3 and GRM5 were remarkably different in patients and healthy controls (p <.0001). Summarily, the aim of this study was to assess the methylation and expression pattern of GluR genes and the risk of OSCC. We are of the presupposition that methylation and expression statuses of the chosen genes, GRM5, GRM2 and GRIA3 might be significant biomarkers for OSCC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) are ion channels with key roles in physiological processes. They are abnormally expressed in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The CaCC component TMEM16A/ANO1 was recently shown to be overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma cells and may serve as a tumorigenic protein. In this study, we determined that matrine is a potent TMEM16A inhibitor that exerts anti-lung adenocarcinoma effects. Patch clamp experiments showed that matrine inhibited TMEM16A current in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 27.94 ± 4.78 μM. Molecular simulation and site-directed mutation experiments demonstrated that the matrine-sensitive sites of the TMEM16A channel involve the amino acids Y355, F411, and F415. Results of cell viability and wound healing assays showed that matrine significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of LA795 cells, which exhibit high TMEM16A expression. In contrast, matrine has only weak inhibitory effect on CCD-19Lu and HeLa cells lacking TMEM16A expression. Matrine-induced effects on the proliferation and migration of LA795 cells were abrogated upon shRNA-mediated TMEM16A knockdown in LA795 cells. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated that matrine dramatically inhibited the growth of lung adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors in mice but did not affect mouse body weight. Collectively, these data indicate that matrine is an effective and safe TMEM16A inhibitor and that TMEM16A is the target of matrine anti-lung adenocarcinoma activity. These findings provide new insight for the development of novel treatments for lung adenocarcinoma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) are known by their immune suppression effects as well as initiation mediators in cancer progression and metastasis. Meanwhile, they are appropriate sources to induce immunity against tumor cells, as consist of tumor specific and associated antigens. The aim of the current study is modifying TEX with microRNA miR-155, miR-142, and let-7i, to enhance their immune stimulation ability and induce potent dendritic cells (DC). For this, exosomes were isolated from mouse mammalian breast cancer cell line; 4T1, and subjected to miR-155, miR-142, and let-7i by electroporation. Immature DCs were generated from mouse bone marrow in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). To mature DCs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TEX, and modified TEX were used. The expression level of miRNAs and their target genes (IL-6, IL-17, IL-1b, TGFβ, SOCS1, KLRK1, IFNγ, and TLR4) was determined. TEX were nanovesicles with spheroid morphology which expressed CD81, CD63, and TSG101, as exosome markers, at protein level. MHCII, CD80, and CD40 as maturation markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Overexpression of miRNAs were confirmed in exosomes and mDCs. Up and downregulation of target genes confirmed the gene network in DC maturation. We found that Let-7i could efficiently induce the DC maturation, as well as miR-142 and miR-155 have enhancing effects. These findings reveal that the modified TEX would be a hopeful cell-free vaccine for the cancer treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide, especially in male. With poor prognosis, significant portions of patients with HNSCC die due to cancer recurrence and tumor metastasis after chemotherapy and targeted therapies. The HNSCC FaDu cell ectopic expression of Twist, a key transcriptional factor of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which triggers EMT and results in the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype, was used as the cell model. Our results demonstrated that treatment with newly synthesized 2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methylnaphthyridin-4-one (CSC-3436), a flavonoid derivative, elicited changes in its cell morphology, upregulated E-cadherin messenger RNA and protein expression, downregulated N-cadherin, vimentin, and CD133 (a marker associated with tumor-initiating cells) in FaDu-pCDH-Twist cells. Moreover, CSC-3436 exposure reduced B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1) expression regulated by Twist and further suppressed the direct co-regulation of E-cadherin by Twist and Bmi1. Interestingly, CSC-3436 reduced EMT, cancer stemness, and migration/invasion abilities through the inhibition of the Twist/Bmi1-Akt/β-catenin pathway. Most importantly, our findings provided new evidence that CSC-3436 played a crucial role in therapeutic targeting to Bmi1 and its molecular pathway in HNSCC, and it will be valuable in prognostic prediction and treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, osteosarcoma survival rates have failed to improve significantly with conventional treatment modalities because of the development of chemotherapeutic resistance. The human breast cancer resistance protein/ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (BCRP/ABCG2), a member of the ATP-binding cassette family, uses ATP hydrolysis to expel xenobiotics and chemotherapeutics from cells. CCN family member 2 (CCN2) is a secreted protein that modulates the biological function of cancer cells, enhanced ABCG2 protein expression and activation in this study via the α6β1 integrin receptor and increased osteosarcoma cell viability. CCN2 treatment downregulated miR-519d expression, which promoted ABCG2 expression. In a mouse xenograft model, knockdown of CCN2 expression increased the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin, which was reversed by ABCG2 overexpression. Our data show that CCN2 increases ABCG2 expression and promotes drug resistance through the α6β1 integrin receptor, whereas CCN2 downregulates miR-519d. CCN2 inhibition may represent a new therapeutic concept in osteosarcoma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Single-agent paclitaxel and vinorelbine are recommended treatments for advanced breast cancer (ABC) non-responsive to hormone therapy and without visceral crisis. This phase II trial compared first-line oral vinorelbine versus weekly paclitaxel for ABC. Methods: Eligible female patients had measurable locally recurrent/metastatic estrogen receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer and had received prior endocrine therapy (any setting) but no chemotherapy for ABC. Patients were stratified by prior taxane and visceral metastases and randomized to either oral vinorelbine 80 mg/m 2 (first cycle at 60 mg/m 2 , escalated to 80 mg/m 2 in the absence of grade 3/4 toxicity) or intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR; confirmed complete or partial response, or stable disease for ≥6 weeks). Results: The 131 randomized patients had received a median of 2 prior endocrine therapies; &gt;70% had prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and 79% visceral metastases. DCR was 75.8% (95% confidence interval: 63.6–85.5%) with vinorelbine and 75.4% (63.1–85.2%) with paclitaxel. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (52%), fatigue (11%), and vomiting (5%) with vinorelbine, and neutropenia (17%), dyspnea (6%), hypertension (6%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5%) with paclitaxel. Grade 2 alopecia occurred in 2% of vinorelbine-treated and 34% of paclitaxel-treated patients. Neither arm showed relevant global health status changes. Conclusion: Oral vinorelbine and paclitaxel demonstrated similar DCRs (∼75%). Safety profiles differed and, together with administration route and convenience, may influence treatment choice (EudraCT number, 2012-003530-16). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Many studies have explored the association between health literacy and health-care utilization; however, the majority assessed functional health literacy in terms of basic skills. Japan's health-care and medical examination system in workplaces is different from that of other major countries. This study examined the relationship of health literacy with health-care use (emergency visit, hospitalization, dental checkup, and health checkup or cancer screening); it focused on differences by occupation and health-care service utilization among general Japanese using the communicative and critical health literacy scale. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of 1002 Japanese residents. Through a questionnaire, we investigated socioeconomic status, health status, health-care use, and health literacy. Among all participants and non-workers, logistic regression analyses revealed that health literacy was significantly associated with health checkup or cancer screening after adjusting for sex, age, marital status, education, and having a disease or disorder (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.431, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.131–1.810; adjusted OR = 1.614, 95% CI, 1.114–2.339, respectively). Among workers, we observed no significant association between health literacy and health-care utilization. These results indicate that health literacy is closely related to use of preventive health-care. Japan's health-care system in workplaces may promote use of preventive health-care services regardless of health literacy, whereas improving health literacy may be more critical among non-workers. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a deadly primary brain cancer, exhibits invasive proliferation into healthy brain tissue. Currently, novel treatment methods are being investigated as possible alternatives to the current standard of care for the disease, which consists of tumor resection followed by additional treatment to prevent tumor recurrence. However, investigation into novel GBM treatments remains hindered by the limited ability of preclinical disease models to accurately assess drug effectiveness and toxicity. Recent developments in the fields of biotechnology and tissue engineering have made 3D bioprinting of hydrogel-based biomaterial scaffolds a feasible method for rapidly producing an accurate in vitro model for glioblastoma, custom designed to the needs of the investigator. Here, we developed a novel fibrin-based 3D printed GBM model for cellular characterization and drug screening using an Aspect Biosystems RX1 bioprinter. Their Lab-On-a-Printer™ microfluidic print head minimizes shear stress, allowing for effective printing of delicate neural tissue. Printed glioblastoma cell–laden structures displayed high levels of cell viability for 12 days following initial printing. Furthermore, printed cells spontaneously formed spheroids with upregulated levels of the proteins CD133 and DCX markers associated with cancer stem cells and metastatic invasiveness, respectively. Printed scaffolds were then treated with a novel chemical treatment method previously tested in 2D culture and showed significant resistance, indicating the 3D printed glioblastoma model's potential as a more accurate representation of the in vivo response to drug treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "We explored possibility that sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) is involved in pH modulation and apoptosis induction in GYY4137 treated cells. We have shown that although 10 days treatment with GYY4137 did not significantly decreased volume of tumors induced by colorectal cancer DLD1 cells in nude mice, it already induced apoptosis in these tumors. Treatment of DLD1 and ovarian cancer A2780 cells with GYY4137 resulted in intracellular acidification in a concentration-dependent manner. We observed increased mRNA and protein expression of both, NCX1 and sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1) in DLD1-induced tumors from GYY4137-treated mice. NCX1 was coupled with NHE1 in A2780 and DLD1 cells and this complex partially disintegrated after GYY4137 treatment. We proposed that intracellular acidification is due to uncoupling of NCX1/NHE1 complex rather than blocking of the reverse mode of NCX1, probably due to internalization of NHE1. Results might contribute to understanding molecular mechanism of H 2 S–induced apoptosis in tumor cells. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The effects of silkworm pupa protein hydrolysates (SPPHs) on the apoptosis of MGC-803 gastric cancer cells were investigated in this study. The role of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in SPPHs-dependent inhibition of MGC-803 cell viability was also explored. SPPHs were found to induce apoptosis in MGC-803 cells with an IC 50 of 0.30 mg/ml. A series of changes in cellular organelle structural were observed during MGC-803 cell apoptosis that included mitochondrial swelling, vacuolation and rupture. These changes may ultimately impact on metabolic energy supply in MGC-803 cells. The expression of the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax, and the activation of cytochrome c (Cyt C), Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 were altered following induction of apoptosis by SPPHs in MGC-803 cells. Moreover, the increase in the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 expression is known to play an important role in the activation of the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. © 2019 Korean Society of Applied Entomology",

    "Abstract": "In metazoan genome, the mechanism of gene expression regulation between transcriptional regulatory elements and their target gene is spatiotemporal. Active promoters possess many specific chromosomal features, such as hypersensitive to DNaseI and enrichment of specific histone modifications. In this article, we proposed a novel method which possesses a high efficiency to find promoters in vitro. A promoter-trap library was constructed with totally 706 random mouse genomic DNA fragment clones, and 260 promoter-active fragments of the library were screened by transient transfection into 4T1 cells. To demonstrate the accuracy of this promoter finding method, 13 fragments with promoter activities were randomly selected for published DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data analysis, downstream transcripts prediction and expression confirmation. qRT-PCR results showed that six predicted transcription units were successfully amplified in different mouse tissues/cells or in reconstituted mouse mammary tumors. Our results indicate that this promoter finding method can successfully detect the promoter-active fragments and their downstream transcripts. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "We present a case report of a man with a history of esophageal cancer who presented with fever, pain, and lower extremity weakness. The patient previously underwent chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy treatment. He also underwent esophageal dilation, stent placement, and removal. MRI scans of the spine revealed a longitudinal spinal epidural abscess (SEA) resulting in compressive myelopathy. The suspected infection cause was gastrointestinal-associated Gram-negative rods tracking to the epidural space from an esophageal fistula. This case demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis and treatment and the role of fistula as an infection source in SEA. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background: In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of GAS5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on GAS5 expression. And the signaling pathways underlying the function of GAS5 during the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PC) were clarified. Materials and methods: Patients with PC were recruited and grouped according to their specific genotypes of rs55829688 and rs145204276. Kaplan–Meier overall survival curves were calculated and compared among different groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were conducted to examine the expression of different factors involved in PC. And computational analyses and luciferase assays were conducted to clarify the regulatory relationships among the above factors. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), flow cytometry, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assays were used to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis. Results: The expression of GAS5, PDCD4, PTEN, and AKT was decreased gradually in the order of patient Group 1–4, whereas the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-1284 showed an opposite trend. GAS5 was identified to target miR-21 and miR-1284, whereas miR-21 and miR-1284 regulated the expression of PDCD4/PTEN and AKT, respectively. Moreover, the GAS5/miR-21/PDCD4/PTEN and GAS5/miR-1284/AKT signaling pathway was found to be closely related to the tumorigenesis of PC. Conclusions: GAS5 SNPs affected the survival rate and prognosis in patients with PC via regulating the expression of miR-21/miR-1284, which in turn affected the expression of PDCD4, PTEN, and AKT. GAS5 downregulated the expression of miR-21/miR-1284, thus leading to the elevated expression of key regulators of apoptosis. Therefore, the GAS5 SNPs may be used as key indicators for the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of PC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Although fluorinated carbon fiber (FC) inherits many excellent properties of carbon materials, and holds great promise in many fields. However, chemical modification and application of FC in biomedicine have been rarely studied, mostly ascribed to large-sized needle-like structure, and inert C–F bonds with strong hydrophobicity. Herein, fluorinated carbon fiber oxide (FCO) enriched with oxygen groups with an average size of 90 nm is prepared, and this then allows us for the first time to modify FCO with biomolecule of hyaluronic acid, rendering FCO special targeting and good dispersibility in various media. Effective control over structure and surface makes FCO exhibit negligible toxicity and possess high near infrared absorption for photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, FCO also has high drug load capacity (1.05 mg/mg), and cell experiments confirm better therapeutic effect of the nanocarrier than single PTT or chemotherapy, making it practically valuable for cancer chemo-photothermal therapy. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "β-glucans are polysaccharides comprising β-D-glucoses with various bioactivities. Herein, we extracted three β-glucans from Lentinus edodes with different sources and assessed their antitumor activities on a mice model with intragastric, intraperitoneal and intratumoral injection. Three polysaccharides were shown to have the same chemical structure of β-(1,3)-glucan with β-(1,6) branches, and exhibited S-180 tumor-suppressing ability with good safety. It was found that β-glucans up-regulated CD4 + T cell level in lymphoid organs decreased by tumor-burden, indicating promotion of immunomodulation. β-glucans targeted tumors in vivo even after oral or intraperitoneal injection. Furthermore, β-glucans not only targeted to lymphoid organs and increased CD4 + T cells number, but also enhanced CD4 + T cells and neutrophils populations in tumors. It was proposed that β-glucans promoted CD4 + T cell immunomodulation and neutrophils infiltration into tumors, leading to tumor growth inhibition. These findings reveal that β-glucans can be used as an effective agent for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "A comparison of the anti-tumor activity of CMPS-II and CBPS-II polysaccharides, respectively is obtained from the fermented mycelium and cultivated fruiting bodies of Cordyceps militaris. This in vitro anti-tumor activity is investigated using an MTT assay, immunofluorescence staining, a Western Blot assay, a qRT-PCR assay, and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. The experimental results indicate that the inhibition rate of CMPS-II on H1299 tumor cells is higher than that of CBPS-II. With a concentration of 500 μ g/mL, the inhibition rate of CMPS-II and CBPS-II were 54.55% and 34.80%, respectively. Both CMPS-II and CBPS-II can increase the protein and mRNA expression level of cell apoptosis factors Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and p53, while reducing the protein and mRNA expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), to induce tumor cells apoptosis. The induction effect of CMPS-II was stronger than CBPS-II. These results suggest that CMPS-II is superior to CBPS-II regarding the inhibition of H1299 lung cancer cells. Furthermore, CMPS-II is a potentially useful substitution for CBPS-II in the treatment of lung cancer and provides new insights into the mechanism of its anti-tumor activity. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is a disease that effects cell metabolism causing an imbalance in the health of the patient. On the other hand, malnutrition, presented by oncological patients, is caused by both the disease and its treatment. Some serum biochemical parameters cannot be determined by the traditional method of laboratory blood analysis (spectrophotometry). Among the various techniques that could be used for blood biochemical analysis, we opted for the Z-scan technique, due to its sensitivity to the reading of blood components. Our objective in this work was to compare the data obtained by the Z-scan technique and the spectrophotometry of the serological samples of children with solid tumors and leukemia under treatment, receiving or not selenium supplementation in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The biochemical parameters were read based on blood. These blood sampling made at different stages of chemotherapy and selenium supplementation. At each of these stages, the cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides parameters were read using the Z-scan and spectrophotometry techniques. We observed that selenium helps in balancing the health of these patients, and corroborates with our hypothesis that the Z-scan technique may be an alternative for the determination of biochemical parameters. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), the first human retrovirus has been discovered which is known to cause the age-old assassinating disease HTLV-1 associated myelopathy. Cancer caused by this virus is adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma which targets 10–20 million throughout the world. The effect of this virus extends to the fact that it causes chronic disease to the spinal cord resulting in loss of sensation and further causes blood cancer. So, to overcome the complications, we designed a subunit vaccine by the assimilation of B-cell, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, and helper T-lymphocyte epitopes. The epitopes were joined together along with adjuvant and linkers and a vaccine was fabricated which was further subjected to 3D modeling. The physiochemical properties, allergenicity, and antigenicity were evaluated. Molecular docking and dynamics were performed with the obtained 3D model against toll like receptor (TLR-3) immune receptor. Lastly, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression of the designed vaccine in pET28a(+) expression vector. The future prospects of the study entailed the in vitro and in vivo experimental analysis for evaluating the immune response of the designed vaccine construct. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previous studies using the NSQIP database to study hepatectomies lacked hepatic specific variables and outcomes. We used the targeted NSQIP hepatectomy database to examine the nationwide trend and the safety profile of synchronous liver and colorectal resection compared with hepatectomy alone for colorectal liver metastasis. Methods: The targeted NSQIP hepatectomy database from 2014 was used to study patients who underwent hepatectomy for diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum. Results: Of the 3064 hepatic resections in the database, 1138 cases were performed for colorectal metastasis. Of these, 1040 were liver-alone surgery and 98 were synchronous liver and colorectal resection. Most (58.7%) patients received neoadjuvant therapy. The rate of neoadjuvant therapy, intraoperative ablation, biliary reconstruction, and the use of minimally invasive technique were similar between the two groups. The overall 30-d mortality in this cohort was low (1.1%). While the mortality rate in the synchronous group was similar to liver-only group (3.1% versus 0.9%, P = 0.077). The rate of liver failure (3.3% versus 4.1%, P = 0.722) and biliary leak (5.3% versus 9.6%, P = 0.084) were similar between the two groups. However, the rate of major complications was higher on multivariable analyses (25.5% versus 12.1%, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.1, P < 0.001) for the synchronous group. Conclusions: Hepatic resection for colorectal metastasis in the modern era has low short-term mortality. While synchronous resection was associated with a higher incidence of major complications, liver-specific complications did not increase with synchronous resection. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles used for biomedical application has received much attention nowadays owing to its quick synthesis, cost effectiveness and biocompatible nature. The present study focuses on the biosynthesis of silver palladium bimetallic nanoparticles (AgPd NPs) from aqueous fruit extract of Terminalia chebula. Synthesized AgPd NP was assessed for antimicrobial activity and anticancer potential against lung cancer cells (A549). XRD analysis confirmed the formation of face centered cubic crystalline structure with average size of 20 nm, which was affirmed by DLS analysis. Uniform spherical shaped nanoparticles were observed in SEM and TEM analysis. Zeta potential value of −14.4 mV illustrated the stability of AgPd NPs. Anticancer studies illustrated that AgPd NPs induced ROS generation in lung cancer cells, thereby stimulating mitochondrial apoptotic pathway causing cell death. AgPd NPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro toxicity studies revealed that AgPd NPs exhibited no cyototoxic and hemolytic effect upto its maximum dose (200 μg/ml), ensuring the biocompatibility of nanoparticles. Our findings demonstrated that aqueous extract of T. chebula act as effective reducing and stabilizing agent for green synthesis of biocompatible AgPd NPs, which exhibits potent antimicrobial and anticancer activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Myocardial Infarction Associated Transcript (MIAT) is a subnuclear lncRNA that interferes with alternative splicing and is associated with increased risk of various heart conditions and nervous system tumours. The current study aims to elucidate the role of MIAT in cell survival, apoptosis and migration in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme. To this end, MIAT was silenced by MIAT-specific siRNAs in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines, and RNA sequencing together with a series of functional assays were performed. The RNA sequencing has revealed that the expression of an outstanding number of genes is altered, including genes involved in cancer-related processes, such as cell growth and survival, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and migration. Furthermore, the functional studies have confirmed the RNA sequencing leads, with our key findings suggesting that MIAT knockdown eliminates long-term survival and migration and increases basal apoptosis in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines. Taken together with the recent demonstration of the involvement of MIAT in glioblastoma, our observations suggest that MIAT could possess tumour-promoting properties, thereby acting as an oncogene, and has the potential to be used as a reliable biomarker for neuroblastoma and glioblastoma and be employed for prognostic, predictive and, potentially, therapeutic purposes for these cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cardiac malignancies are exceptionally rare, mostly occur as secondaries of lung, esophageal tumors, or lymphomas in the context of systemic illness, and usually found on autopsy. We present an exceedingly rare case of solitary metastasis of mucinous adenocarcinoma occupying 80% of the right ventricle and involving tricuspid valve, discovered 17 years after a diagnosis and treatment of a colon cancer. The patient's clinical presentation, diagnosis, and surgical management are detailed. This case provides evidence that late metastasizing colonic carcinoma and ventricular location of metastasis can and do occur. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate inter- and intra-observer variabilities of catheter reconstruction and its dosimetric impact for multi-catheter interstitial breast cancer patients. Methods and materials: In order to evaluate inter-observer variabilities (IOV) three medical physicists reconstructed the catheter traces of 13 patients. These manual reconstructions were further compared to the automatic reconstruction algorithm integrated into the planning system and one on purpose imprecise manual reconstruction. For intra-observer variabilities (IAV) repeated reconstructions of two physicists were compared for 13 patients. In total 426 catheters were considered. Keeping dwell times, dwell positions, the optimization and the normalization relative points constant the geometrical deviations between the corresponding dwell positions of the reference data set and the investigated reconstructions were evaluated. Also, the effect on the quality indices, such as coverage index (CI), dose non-uniformity ratio (DNR) or conformal index (COIN), and the exposure of the organs at risk were analyzed. Results: Over all patients and all different catheter reconstructions considered for IOV a mean deviation between the corresponding dwell positions of 0.60 ± 0.35 mm was detected. The first observer had a mean deviation of 0.54 ± 0.32 mm, whereas the second observer yielded a mean deviation of 0.58 ± 0.37 mm. The length of the catheter traces varied in the mean by 0.51 ± 0.45 mm. The mean relative deviation of the CI, DNR, COIN, mean heart dose and mean lung dose varied by 0.27 ± 0.31%, 0.0027 ± 0.0025, 0.0036 ± 0.0033, 0.024 ± 0.019%, 0.05 ± 0.11%, respectively. The skin dose (D 0.2ccm ) changed in the maximum 8.52%. On average IAV reached a deviation between the corresponding dwell positions of 0.49 ± 0.30 mm. IOVs and IAVs proved to be significantly different (Wilcoxon's test p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The study proved that a repeated reconstruction of the catheter traces does not lead to large geometrical deviations or to a significant change in the dose exposure. But the lack of ground truth makes the estimation of the quality of the reconstruction challenging. A precise reconstruction mapping the reality is a necessity for the planned dose delivery. With all considered reconstruction techniques reliable quality indices for the target and the organs at risk could be obtained. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a multifunctional magnetic Bio-Metal-Organic Framework (Fe 3 O 4 @Bio-MOF) coated with folic acid-chitosan conjugate (FC) was successfully prepared for tumor-targeted delivery of curcumin (CUR) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) simultaneously. Bio-MOF nanocomposite based on CUR as organic linker and zinc as metal ion was prepared by hydrothermal method in the presence of amine-functionalized Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 @NH 2 MNPs). 5-FU was loaded in the magnetic Bio-MOF and the obtained nanocarrier was then coated with FC network. The prepared nanocomposite (NC) was fully characterized by high resolution-transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and UV–vis analyses. In vitro release study showed controlled release of CUR and 5-FU in acidic pH confirming high selectivity and performance of the carrier in cancerous microenvironments. The selective uptake of 5-FU-loaded Fe 3 O 4 @Bio-MOF-FC by folate receptor-positive MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated and verified. The ultimate nanocarrier exhibited no significant toxicity, while drug loaded nanocarrier showed selective and higher toxicity against the cancerous cells than normal cells. SDS PAGE was also utilized to determine the protein pattern attached on the surface of the nanocarriers. In vitro and in vivo MRI studies showed negative signal enhancement in tumor confirming the ability of the nanocarrier to be applied as diagnostic agent. Owing to the selective anticancer release and cellular uptake, acceptable blood compatibility as well as suitable T 2 MRI contrast performance, the target nanocarrier could be considered as favorable theranostic in breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) differentiation antagonizing nonprotein coding RNA (DANCR) has been identified as an oncogene in several cancers. However, the biological function and role of DANCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Our current study aimed to investigate the detailed mechanism of DANCR in HCC. We found that DANCR was significantly upregulated in HCC cell lines in comparison to LO2 cells. Then, we observed that knockdown of DANCR could greatly inhibit Huh7 and HepG2 cell proliferation. In addition, HCC cell apoptosis was increased by silence of DANCR and meanwhile, cell cycle progression was blocked in G1 phase. Apart from these, downregulation of DANCR repressed HCC cell migration and invasion ability obviously. As predicted by the bioinformatics analysis, microRNA-216a-5p (miR-216a-5p) could serve as a direct target of DANCR. MiR-216a-5p has been reported to be involved in many cancers. Here, the correlation between miR-216a-5p and DANCR was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter assay and radioimmunoprecipitation assay. Subsequently, Kruppel-like factor 12 (KLF12) exerts an important role in different tumor types. KLF12 can function as a downstream target of miR-216a-5p. Finally, the in vivo experiments were used and the data proved that DANCR also strongly suppressed HCC tumor growth in vivo via targeting miR-216a-5p and KLF12. In conclusion, our study indicated that DANCR might provide a new perspective for HCC treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Herein, a delicate ratiometric electrochemiluminescence biosensor was designed for the detection of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) based on 2-(Dibutylamino)ethanol (DBAE) and lucigenin as anodic and cathodic ECL emitter, respectively. Initially, NiFe 2 O 4 nanotubes (NiFe 2 O 4 NTs) with charming properties could act as catalytically promoted sensing platform. This NiFe 2 O 4 NTs based platform could trigger an intense ECL emission of DBAE for the reason that NiFe 2 O 4 NTs not only achieved the high loading of Envision-Ab 1 complex but effectively catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to yield oxygen. Moreover, the Envision complex, a polymeric material containing enrich horseradish peroxidase (HRP) could further accelerate the H 2 O 2 decomposition to generate superoxide (O 2 [rad] − ) for the enhancement of the ECL emission process of two luminophors. It's noteworthy that hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BN) as the nanolabels, was first illustrated to be capable of immobilizing a large quantity of lucigenin and retaining intense and stable ECL emission of lucigenin in the alkaline condition. Benefiting from the above merits, a new ECL ratiometric sensing mode was established for the sensitive determination of HE4 in a range from 10 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with the detection limit of 3.3 fg/mL. The strategy exhibited broad prospect in early ovarian cancer diagnosis and blazed a new path for other tumors screening. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A large range of nanoscale superparamagnetic materials has been under scrutiny from the point of view of their potential theranostic, multimodal applications. In this paper we have investigated the effect of replacing Fe 3+ cations with Gd 3+ and Tb 3+ in the core of the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in search for the optimum level of magnetic core doping with these lanthanides. We have found that the presence of Gd 3+ and Tb 3+ up to 2.5% at. does not alter significantly the crystallographic structure of such nanoferrites and does not compromise the magnetic properties of doped nanoparticles. The doping level, though relatively small, exceeds the levels of currently used radiopharmaceuticals, where only few radionuclides can be incorporated in a single radiotherapeutic molecule. This new type of multifunctional nanoparticles can be used not only as drug carriers or in magnetic hyperthermia, but also in the so-called endoradiotherapy. The latter feature can be easily implemented upon the replacement of “cold” ions of Tb 3+ and Gd 3+ in the superparamagnetic core with their isotopes emitting soft β − radiation suitable for the internal radiotherapy, localized directly within the tumor. Therefore, these nanoparticles can be used simultaneously in targeted drug delivery, hyperthermia and radiotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Rational: Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMTs) are rare tumors often causing tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), with surgical resection being the first line in the treatment of TIO. There are very few reports of PMTs located in the brain. The authors present one such case, it's management and outcome as well as a review of the literature. Patient concerns: The authors report of a 58 year old male with a background of osteoporosis, bone pain, muscle weakness and gait disturbances for the past several years. He presented to our institution with newly developed absence spells. He underwent imaging which revealed a brain tumor. Interventions: The patient underwent surgery for what was suspected as a meningioma. A gross total resection was done. The pathological diagnosis was that of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor. Outcomes: Removal of the tumor helped in alleviating the patient's back symptoms immediately after surgery. The patient was discharged home and was followed up by an endocrinologist, with improvement of his bone pain, his muscle weakness and his gait disturbances. Lessons: PMT with involvement of the brain can be treated surgically. Removal of the tumor will alleviate symptoms in patients harboring this rare brain tumor. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and the third of cancer mortality worldwide. Although the study of HCC has made great progress, the molecular mechanism and signal pathways of HCC are not yet clear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the early diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers for HCC. The aim of this study is to screen the relevant genes and study the association of gene expression with the survival status of HCC patients using bioinformatics approaches, in the hope of establishing marker genes for diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. The gene expression data and corresponding clinical information of HCC samples were downloaded from the The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We performed to study the relationship between gene expression and prognosis of HCC and screen significantly relevant genes associated with prognosis of HCC by analyzing survival and function enrichment of genes. In this study, we collected 421 samples with gene expression data, including 371 tumor samples and 50 normal samples. By using single factor Cox regression analysis, we screened 1,197 genes significantly associated with survival time in the modeling data containing 117 samples and also searched six genes as the best markers to predict living status of HCC patients. Besides, we established score system of survival risk of HCC. Our study recognized six genes (PGBD3, PGM5P3-AS1, RNF5, UTP11, BAG6, and KCND2) to be significantly associated with diagnosis and prognosis of HCC, providing novel targets for studying potential mechanism about the progression of HCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Sorafenib is the first-line treatment of HCC. Although sorafenib has positive effects on the survival of patients, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to extend survival and improve the efficacy of sorafenib. This study combines sorafenib with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a new approach to enhance the efficacy of sorafenib. Material and methods: A subcutaneous xenograft model of HCC, established by human HepG2 cell lines, was implanted into the flank of nude mice and was used to evaluate tumor growth after treatment with sorafenib alone or in combination with MSCs. The aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels were measured for safety assessment. Histopathological studies were performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry tests were performed to evaluate proliferation (Ki67) and angiogenesis (CD34). The TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis and measure the expression of major inflammatory cytokines (IL-1a, IL-10, and TNF-α) with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result: Sorafenib, in combination with MSCs, strongly inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft model. Furthermore, the combination therapy significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, decreased tumor angiogenesis, and induced apoptosis and maintained antitumor-associated anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs. Conclusion: This combination therapy strategy could be used as a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of HCC that significantly improves upon the results achieved using sorafenib as monotherapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: With high rates of HIV/AIDS and rising burdens of non-communicable diseases, Zambians increasingly need palliative care. While efforts are underway to grow Zambia's palliative care system, the most recent situational analysis of palliative care in Zambia, conducted in 2008, revealed substantial gaps in availability. Methods: To provide an updated appraisal of breast and cervical cancer services in Zambia, including palliative care, we conducted a nationwide provincial and tertiary hospital survey. All 9 provincial hospitals and the University Teaching Hospital and Cancer Diseases Hospital in Lusaka Province participated (N = 11). The survey was conducted between August 2014 and January 2015 and administered in-person at each facility. Data regarding the availability of inpatient, outpatient, and community-based palliative care services, palliative medications, and psychosocial supports was obtained at each facility. The reported results are descriptive in nature. Results: Although the need for palliative care services was recognized, many facilities (64%) lack palliative care policies and only 18% offer palliative care in a coordinated program. The majority of services are only available to inpatients and rarely include community-based programs. While all facilities had adequate supplies of acetaminophen, 82% reported unavailability of codeine and 45% reported no access to oral morphine. Conclusions: This assessment confirms the dearth of palliative care services across Zambia. Less than half of its provincial hospitals offer community- or home-based services and only 55% offer opioid analgesics. Immediate and substantial improvements in policy, drug procurement and distribution, and service expansion are needed to ensure high-quality palliative care is available throughout Zambia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Funding Text 1": "This analysis utilizes data from a facility assessment survey completed at all 9 provincial hospitals as well as the University Teaching Hospital and Cancer Diseases Hospital in Lusaka (N = 11). The survey methods are described in detail in our prior publication of the primary findings [ 8 ]. Briefly, facilities were chosen due to their priority listing for service expansion in the Zambian National Cancer Control Strategic Plan. At each facility, we administered an in-person survey to collect self-reported data on human resources and facility infrastructure for providing breast and cervical cancer services, including palliative care. We also conducted a structured interview with each Provincial Health Officer. A member of our research team traveled to each facility to administer the survey and conduct key informant interviews. The survey, developed by our team, examined three domains. The first was the availability of and demand for palliative care. The availability domain included surveying facilities on the number and types of healthcare providers available at that location as well as the availability of specific services. As part of this domain, we also evaluated whether patients seek palliative care and the settings where services are available. The second domain was an assessment of availability of psychosocial and spiritual support for patients and families. The third domain was the accessibility of palliative care medications. Medications were selected from the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care List of Essential Medicines for Palliative Care. Stock-outs of key medications were evaluated via self-report by asking: (1) in-stock today, (2) out of stock today, (3) out of stock for 7 days, (4) out of stock for 30 days, (5) out of stock for 90 days, (6) not available, or (7) don’t know. Descriptive analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, U.S.A.). Regulatory approval was provided by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the University of Zambia (Ref no. 009-06-14) and the Zambian Ministry of Health. Approvals included a waiver of informed consent as our unit of analysis was the facility. 3",

    "Abstract": "Background: Ampulla of Vater carcinoma (AVC) is known to have better prognosis than other periampullary cancers that need pancreaticoduodenectomy for cure. However, up to 60% of patients who underwent curative resection develop recurrence, and the disease progresses rapidly in many patients. Inflammatory factors are known to be prognostic indicators related to poor overall survival (OS) in patients with other gastrointestinal cancers. This retrospective review aimed to assess the prognostic significance of the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) in patients who underwent curative resection for AVC. Method: We retrospectively reviewed and abstracted data from the medical records of 169 patients who underwent surgical resection for AVC from January 2009 through December 2013. We investigated the association between the preoperative NLR, PLR, and GPS and disease-free survival (DFS) and OS. Results: In multivariable analysis, both high NLR and PLR were not associated with poor DFS but were significantly related to poor OS (NLR: hazard ratio [HR] 1.916, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.181–3.108, p = 0.008; PLR: HR 1.758, 95% CI 1.071–2.886, p = 0.026). GPS was not a significant prognostic factor for either DFS or OS in both univariable and multivariable analyses. Young age was not related to OS but was significantly associated with poor DFS in both univariable and multivariable analyses (HR 0.356, 95% CI 0.163–0.778, p = 0.010). Conclusion: As systemic inflammatory markers, high preoperative NLR and PLR were related to poor OS in patients with AVC with curative resection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Presently, quite a lot of research that are being carried out to find a potential cure for cancer and many had made to clinical trial stage as well. In the present study, we focus on use of a novel graphene oxide functionalized chitosan nanoparticle targeting Saos-2 and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. The graphene oxide chitosan nanoparticles were loaded with siRNA, studied for in vitro release with varying concentration & pH, and fitted to peppas model. MTT & ROS assay was used to evaluate biocompatibility of carrier and qPCR to study the inflammatory responses in particular checking gene expression of IL-6, TGF-ß, TNF-α in both RAW 264.7 and bone marrow derived macrophages. The results of study showed that release of siRNA were in a controlled fashion and effective at acidic pH that prevails on tumor site. The material was biocompatible and effective in case of Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells with a viability of 0.4 ± 0.43 and 0.49 ± 0.53 in case of MG-63 cells when treated with highest concentration of 100 μl siRNA compared to untreated cells that were in range of 0.64 ± 0.67 in Saos-2 and 0.61 ± 0.63 in MG-63 cells. The results of expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TGF-β & TNF-α showed negligible amount compared to control group serving the purpose of an effective carrier targeting tumor cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT) using a resectoscope has been standard treatment for bladder cancer. However, no treatment method promotes the repair of resected bladder tissue. The aim of this study was to examine the healing process of damaged bladder tissue after a transurethral injection of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the bladder. An injection of magnetic MSCs meant that they accumulated in the damaged area of the bladder. Another aim of this study was to compare the acceleration effect of MSC magnetic delivery on the repair of bladder tissue with that of non-magnetic MSC injection. Methods: Using the transurethral approach to avoid opening the abdomen, electrofulguration was carried out on the anterior wall of the urinary bladder of white Japanese rabbits to mimic tumor resection. An external magnetic field directed at the injured site was then applied using a 1-tesla (T) permanent magnet. Twelve rabbits were divided into three groups. The 1 × 106 of magnetically labeled MSCs were injected into the urinary bladder with or without the magnetic field (MSC M+ and MSC M-groups, respectively), and phosphate-buffered saline was injected as the control. The effects of the injections in the three groups at 14 days were examined using 4.7-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then macroscopically and histologically. The mRNA expressions of several cytokines in the repair tissues were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The macroscopic findings showed the area of repair tissue in the MSC M+ group to be larger than that in either the MSC M-group or control group. MRI clearly depicted the macroscopic findings. The histological study showed that repair of the cauterized area with myofibrous tissue was significantly better in the MSC M+ group than that in either the MSC M-group or control group, although there was no significant difference in several mRNA cytokines among the three groups at 14 days after surgery. Conclusions: The magnetic delivery of MSCs shows promise as an effective, minimally invasive method of enhancing tissue regeneration after TURBT. © 2018 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine",

    "Abstract": "Clival chordomas represent very challenging neoplasms, due to their tendency to infiltrate bone, frequent recurrence, involvement of important neurovascular structures, and deep location. Lesions involving the brainstem remain difficult to access through conventional skull-base approaches which are often associated with significant morbidities. We present a successful purely endoscopic endonasal transclival resection of a rare chordoma located in the ventromedial pons. Recent advances in endoscopic technology make endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) a possible alternative to the treatment of ventral brainstem lesions. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Assay technologies capable of detecting biomarker concentrations in unprocessed whole blood samples are fundamental for applications in medical diagnostics. SERS nano-tags integrated magnetic-separation biosensor (MSB) was realized for the first time for immunoassay in whole blood. The reliability and sensitivity of this method rely, in a large extent, on the quality and properties of the SERS nano-tags. The constructed silicacoated Ag SERS nano-tags as labels were used in a rapid and specific MSB immune sensor to detect Matrix Metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) in unprocessed blood samples. With fast screening ability and outstanding sensitivity, we anticipate that this method would greatly promote practical application of stroke-based early-stage cancer diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), as an important biomolecule, is involved in various physiology and pathologic processes such as cellular signal transduction, host defense, and pathogen invasion. Thus, convenient and efficient detection of H 2 O 2 in living organisms is of paramount significance and has drawn tremendous interest from researchers worldwide. In the present study, a novel H 2 O 2 -recognition moiety, the acetyl group, was proposed. Based on this unique recognition moiety, a new near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe was designed and synthesized for detecting H 2 O 2 . With numerous advantages including high selectivity and sensitivity, good compatibility and low cytotoxicity, this probe not only has the great competence to monitor endogenous H 2 O 2 in cells, tissues, and in vivo but also has the huge potentiality to be employed in the diagnosis of H 2 O 2 -related cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Curcumin (CR) is a natural compound with a well-known antioxidant and therapeutic activity. Its stability may be enhanced when incorporated in different matrices as a layered double hydroxides (LDH) matrix. Curcumin intercalated layered double hydroxide nanohybrid is a potential drug delivery system for effective photodynamic therapy in human breast cancer or skin cancer. The synthesis of the hybrid LDH-CR powder implies the dissolution of CR in water or in another organic solvent which is miscible with water. Since the solubility of curcumin in water is very weak, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the solvent employed for its dissolution on the structural and physico-chemical-photoluminescent properties of the resulting hybrid materials. Four powders of curcumin (CR)-containing Mg2.5Al-LDH hybrids (Mg/Al molar ratio of 2.5) were prepared by co-precipitation (P) and reconstruction (R) using two different solvents for the dissolution of curcumin: (i) an alkaline aqueous solution (A), and (ii) ethanol (E). The reconstruction used the calcinated (460 °C for 18 h) form of the parent Mg2.5Al-LDH powder. All the solids were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR-ATR spectra of the all the powders except the powder prepared via reconstruction in ethanol exhibit LDH characteristics, consistent with the XRD results. Matrix Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation (MAPLE) was employed for the deposition of hybrid LDH-CR thin films. Aqueous solutions of the as prepared hybrid LDH-CR powders were frozen and used as targets for MAPLE depositions. The films were deposited using a nanosecond laser emitting at 266 nm. MAPLE is considered a “soft” deposition technique suitable to conserve the CR stability. XRD, scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements were used to characterize the deposited films in order to evidence the influence of the preparation methods on the structural and photophysical characteristics of the hybrid LDH-CR films. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Conventional radiation therapy has been progressively replaced by fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) and single fraction radiosurgery for dealing with benign intracranial lesions. Purpose of our study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of FSRT in a series of patients with benign intracranial tumors. Methods: 31 patients with benign intracranial lesions treated with FSRT between 2006 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Indications for treatment included post-operative residual tumor growth or symptomatic exacerbation in patients in whom surgery was not indicated. A clinical and radiological outcome evaluation was performed. Univariate analysis was executed to identify predictors for post-treatment neurological function and radiological tumor control. Results: Median age was 62 years (range 22–82). The lesions treated included 20 meningiomas, 2 vestibular schwannomas, 7 pituitary adenomas, 1 craniopharyngioma, 1 jugular-tympanic paraganglioma. Median clinical target volume was 14.59 cm 3 (range 0.43–159.06) and median planning treatment volume was 18.16 cm 3 (range 0.81–217.24). Median total dose was 45 Gy (range 25–54), and median daily fraction 4 Gy (range 1.8–9). At a median follow-up of 78 and 50 months, respectively clinical and neuroradiological, no tumor had larger dimensions, and only one lesion changed in a way other than size determining a concomitant clinical worsening. Other three patients deteriorated without evidence of radiological progression. Conversely, 12 patients improved clinically. No significant predictor for post-treatment neurological function or radiological tumor control was found. Conclusion: FSRT may represent, when indicated, a safe and effective treatment modality for benign intracranial tumors, especially for large/irregular lesions. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "We present here preparation of mechanically strong and biocompatible cryogel composites based on hyaluronic acid (HA) and halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) of various compositions, and their applications as scaffold for different cell growing media. Uniaxial compression tests reveal that the incorporation of HNTs into HA cryogels leads to a ~2.5-fold increase in their Young moduli, e.g., from 38 ± 1 to 99 ± 4 kPa at a HA:HNTs weight ratio of 1:2. Although HA:HNTs based cryogels were found to be blood compatible with 1.37 ± 0.11% hemolysis ratio at a HA:HNTs weight ratio of 1:2, they trigger thrombogenic activity with a blood clotting index of 17.3 ± 4.8. Remarkably, HA:HNTs cryogel composites were found to be excellent scaffold materials in the proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), and human colon cancer cells (HCT116). The cell studies revealed that an increased amount of HNT embedding into HA cryogels leads to an increase of MSC proliferation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Glucosinolates (GLS) have been reported to have significant anti-oxidative, antimicrobial, and anti-cancer activities. The current study was aimed to develop an analytical method for glucosinolate quantitation in eight Brassica species from Gwangju, Republic of Korea. For this purpose the UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS technique was used and validated for optimal extraction conditions, detection and quantitation limits, linearity, precision, and accuracy. According to the results of GLS profiling, the total GLS concentration decreased in the order of cabbage > broccoli > cauliflower > mustard > kimchi cabbage > young radish ∼ kale. All Brassica species contained glucoerucin (GER) and glucobrassicin (GBR) as major GLS with the high levels in cabbage (5.913 μM/g) and broccoli (1.723 μM/g), respectively. The contents of minor GLS were species-dependent, and could therefore be used for Brassica species classification. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "The study aimed to identify the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) biomarkers for occurrence and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and simultaneously to investigate the potential role of lncRNAs in the oncogenesis of HCC. The lncRNAs expression data and the corresponding clinical information of HCC samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The differentially expressed genes and lncRNAs were identified and the correlation networks were constructed. In this study, we identified 212 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 7,577 differentially expressed genes between liver HCC tumor tissues and normal tissue samples. And then, combining with clinical information, a total of 11 lncRNAs and 162 genes as HCC biomarkers were identified by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Further, through coexpress network analysis, we confirmed four lncRNAs (lncRNA_ANKRD10.IT1, lncRNA_CTD.2583A14.8, lncRNA_RP11.404P21.3, and lncRNA_RP11.488L18.10), which can serve as prognostic biomarkers for HCC. The four lncRNAs identified in this study may serve as a potential therapy target for HCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Spindlin 1 (SPIN1), which contains Tudor-like domains, regulates maternal transcripts via interaction with a messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein. SPIN1 is involved in tumorigenesis in somatic cells and is highly expressed in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the role of SPIN1 in porcine oocyte maturation remains totally unknown. To explore the function of SPIN1 in porcine oocyte maturation, knockdown, and overexpression techniques were used. SPIN1 mRNA was identified in maternal stages ranging from GV to MII. SPIN1 was localized in the cytoplasm and to chromosomes during meiosis. SPIN1 knockdown accelerated first polar body extrusion. Oocytes with overexpressed SPIN1 were arrested at the MI stage. SPIN1 depletion caused meiotic spindle defects and chromosome instability. The BUB3 signal was investigated, confirming that SPIN1 affects the stability of Bub3 mRNA as well as BUB3 expression. Further, overexpression of SPIN1 inhibited the degradation and regulation of G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B1. In summation, SPIN1 regulates the meiotic cell cycle by modulating the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: While most human papillomavirus (HPV) infection clears on its own, persistent HPV infection can cause genital warts and anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers in men. We conducted genetic analysis in a sub-cohort of the HPV infection in men (HIM) study to test the hypothesis that differences in host genes influence HPV persistence in men. Methods: Baseline and longitudinal genital HPV status at the genitals was measured every 6-months using the Linear Array assay amplified HPV L1 gene fragment using the PGMY09/11 L1 consensus primer system. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the customized genome-wide genotyping array, the “TxArray,” were examined using logistic regression in a case-control study design to assess the association with HPV16 persistence/clearance. Results: Of the total of 737,742 autosomal SNPs in the array, 605,885 passed basic quality control and were examined between 40 men (cases) with &gt; 18 months persistent genital HPV 16 infection vs. 151 controls who were HPV 16-positive, but whose infections cleared in &lt; 18 months. The logistic regression analysis from this case-control study showed variants in several gene regions associated with genital HPV 16 persistence, with the strongest association detected with SNPs on chromosomes 20 (p &lt; 5.72 × 10−6) and 15 (p &lt; 5.89 × 10−6), after adjusting for age, smoking status, number of sex partners and four principal components (ancestral background). Conclusions: Our results provide a preliminary basis for understanding the biological mechanism of oncogenic HPV 16 pathogenesis at the genitals in men. Some of the genes flanking the top hit SNPs are consistent with previous findings in both HPV related and non-related cancers but further genetic studies in larger cohorts are warranted to confirm these and identify novel major susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of genital HPV persistence in men. © 2018 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "To investigate the structure, in vitro digestibility and activity of polysaccharides from lotus root, their main fractions named LRPs were isolated and purified by gel filtration chromatography. Structural analyses indicated that: LRPs were α‑(1 → 6)‑D‑heteroglucans mainly composed of Glc-(1→ →6)-Glc-(1→ →6)-Gal-(1→ →4,6)-Gal-(1→ and →3,6)-Glc-(1→ at a molar ratio of 1.00: 4.33: 0.83: 0.13: 1.14; the total molar percentage of other monosaccharides in LRPs, including Man, Rha, GalA and Ara, was 8.10%; the molecular weights of LRPs was in the range of 1.33 kDa to 5.30 kDa. According to the change of molecular weight and the productions of reducing sugar and free monosaccharide, the simulated experiments of salivary, gastric and intestinal digestion confirmed that LRPs were almost undigestible. Moreover, LRPs showed the scavenging ability against DPPH and hydroxyl radicals, the growth inhibition ability against SGC7901 and HepG2 cancer cells in vitro, and the immunostimulating effect on the NO and TNF-α productions of macrophages in vitro. LRPs nearly remain their initial structure and activities in upper gastrointestinal tract and have health-improving potentials. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "A novel β-cyclodextrin-based nanosponge (CDNS) was proposed as curcumin (CUR) delivery system improving pharmacokinetics and anticancer activity of CUR. The effect of molar ratio of Epiclon (EPI) as cross-linker and β-cyclodextrin (βCD) on the porosity, surface area, swelling ratio, CUR solubility and loading capacity, rate of drug release and selective toxicity of the CDNSs was fully investigated. The high degree of cross-linking led to the formation of mesoporous CDNS having high specific surface area and high loading capacity. All CUR-free CDNSs showed no toxicity against MCF 10A and 4T1 cells as normal and cancerous cells, respectively. While CDNSs-CUR exhibited selective toxicity against cancerous cells. In sum, high CUR aqueous solubility, significant loading and controllable release of the CUR, outstanding and selective toxicity against cancerous cells make CDNS8-CUR (EPI/βCD = 8) as promising candidate for further study in the cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Artemisia annua L. is the main artemisinin source, a sesquiterpene lactone used in the treatment against cancer and malaria, whose demand is high and the costs involving its production must be feasible. The main objective of the present work was to define a industrially and economically viable technology to obtain artemisinin. The experimental conditions of temperature, pressure and co-solvent use for obtaining extracts enriched in artemisinin by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) were investigated, and an economic evaluation of the SFE was performed in comparison with the conventional extraction using ethanol. The techno-economic analysis showed that among the conditions evaluated in the present study, SFE at 60 °C and 250 bar, without co-solvent, was the most promising production condition. Nevertheless, for the commercial viability of the arteminisin extraction using SFE it is indicated to use A. annua rigorously selected, and to reduce costs of raw material. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The potential hazard to human health from exposure to toxic metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in street dust was assessed using thirty street dust samples collected from Abadan, an industrial city in Southwest Iran. The mean concentration of Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Cd, Ni, V, As and Co in the street dust was: 59, 288, 113, 50, 0.5, 57, 36, 7.1 and 7.5 (mg/kg), respectively. The majority of potentially toxic metals were elevated compared to background concentrations, with the exception of Co and V. Mean enrichment factors decreased in the following order: Zn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; Cd &gt; As &gt; Cr &gt; Ni &gt; Co &gt; V, with a high enrichment value for Zn and Pb. Cadmium had a moderate potential ecological risk compared to other toxic metals. Correlation coefficients and principal component analysis (PCA) identified three principal groups as sources of toxic metals in Abadan street dust. Metals such as Cr, Ni, Co and V were identified to originate from natural parent materials, Zn, Cu and Pb from anthropogenic sources emitted from combustion/vehicular materials and Cd and As from other anthropogenic sources such as the Abadan refinery and petrochemical complex. The sum of 13 PAHs ranged from 400 to 11,766 (μg/kg), with a mean of 2436 (μg/kg). Approximately 68%–79% of ∑PAHs comprised of higher molecular weight PAHs (HMWPAHs 4–6 rings), revealing a combustion origin. Principal component analysis (PCA) for PAHs in Abadan street dust originated mainly from vehicular, petroleum emission and fossil fuel. The toxic equivalency quantities (TEQs) of PAHs in the street dust ranges from 22 to 951 (μg/kg). High coefficients of correlation (r 2 = 0.98 to 0.83, p &lt; 0.01) among Pyrene, Benzo (a) anthracene, Chrysene, Benzo (a) pyrene, Benzo (b) fluoranthene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, and TEQ of street dust showed that these PAHs were principal contributors to TEQ. Ecosystem risk calculations for PAHs were high since the value of RQ ∑PAHs (MPCs) was ≥1 and RQ ∑PAHs (NCs) was ≥800. The mean values for RQ ∑PAHs (MPCs) and RQ ∑PAHs (NCs) were 8 and 1151, which indicated a relatively high ecosystem risk of PAHs in street dust in Abadan. The total cancer risk was 8.64 × 10 −3 for adults and 8.95 × 10 −4 for children, suggesting a high potential cancer risk through both dust dermal contact and ingestion pathways. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Several studies have documented the HPV genotypes in the Senegalese general population. The objective was to explore the HPV genotype distribution in Senegalese FSWs in order to assess the potential relevance of currently-available vaccines. Methods: Vaginal swabs samples collected as part of the National Integrated Biological and Behavioral Survey in 14 regions throughout the country were randomly selected for HPV testing using bead-based multiplex genotyping (TS-MPG). Results: Among the 436 FSW samples analyzed, the overall HPV prevalence was 79.8% (N = 348), with 70.1% (N = 244) cases presenting as multiple infections. High Risk HPV genotypes affecting at least 10% of FSWs included in order of decreasing frequency: 52, 16, 35, 51, 33, 31, 18, and 45. Sixty-seven (15.4%) FSWs were HIV positive and they were significantly more affected by HPV (94% vs 77%; p < 0.01) than seronegative FSWs as well as infections with multiple genotype. Conclusion: The present study indicates that FSW in Senegal experience a high burden of HPV infection with a high frequency of coinfection with HIV and multiple HPV genotypes. Public health interventions for this key population should include an earlier cervical dysplasia/cancer detection and preventative measures such as vaccination programs that must consider the HPV genotype distribution. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) is a co-receptor for some Wnt proteins including Wnt5a that activate the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. Upregulation of ROR2 is associated with several cancer forms. The extracellular region of ROR2, which contains an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, a Frizzled like cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and a Kringle domain, is a potential anticancer drug target. The structural and biochemical properties of the ROR2 extracellular region remain largely unexplored. Here we describe the mapping and purification, using a baculovirus - insect cell system, of a near-full-length ROR2 extracellular fragment (residues 53–402), which is well-behaved and suitable for future structural and biochemical analysis. We show that the extracellular region of ROR2 per se is monomeric in solution. Different monoclonal antibodies raised against the purified ROR2 protein can specifically recognize the protein and can either inhibit or activate the PCP activity in a cell-based assay, and are thus potentially useful for future mechanistic and therapeutic/diagnostic studies. The biological relevance of these antibodies further demonstrates that the purified recombinant ROR2 protein is properly folded and biochemically active. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Papillomaviruses infect humans and animals, most often causing benign proliferations on skin or mucosal surfaces. Rarely, these infections persist and progress to cancer. In humans, this transformation most often occurs with high-risk papillomaviruses, where viral integration is a critical event in carcinogenesis. The first aim of this study was to sequence the viral genome of canine papillomavirus (CPV) 16 from a pigmented viral plaque that progressed to metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in a dog. The second aim was to characterize multiple viral genomic deletions and translocations as well as host integration sites. The full viral genome was identified using a combination of PCR and high throughput sequencing. CPV16 is most closely related to chipapillomaviruses CPV4, CPV9, and CPV12 and we propose CPV16 be classified as a chipapillomavirus. Assembly of the full viral genome enabled identification of deletion of portions of the E1 and E2/E4 genes and two viral translocations within the squamous cell carcinoma. Genome walking was performed which identified four sites of viral integration into the host genome. This is the first description of integration of a canine papillomavirus into the host genome, raising the possibility that CPV16 may be a potential canine high-risk papillomavirus type. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "A novel hydrogel shell on cancer cells was prepared via in situ photopolymerization of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate (PEGDA) using methylene blue (MB) sensitized mesoporous titania nanocrystal for effective photodynamic therapy (PDT). TiO 2 in this system served as an effective photosensitizer and initiator for the formation of hydrogel, also can protect the MB from being degraded into an inactive form. While MB was used as a significant photosensitive additive to improve the photochemistry effects of TiO 2 and widen its optical response area to near infrared region (660–900 nm). The PEGDA hydrogel with peritumoral injectability shows competitive advantages, i.e. good biocompatibility and hydrophily, selective and minimally invasive delivery of TiO 2 @MB, maintaining a high PDT drug concentration for inducing tumor apoptosis, localized and sustainable release under 660 nm laser irradiation for reducing side effect. The hydrogel also could load chemo-therapy drugs, and serve as a versatile platform for multimode antitumor treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Hsp90s are key proteins in cellular homeostasis since they interact with many client proteins. Several studies indicated that Hsp90s are potential targets for treating diseases, such as cancer or malaria. It has been shown that Hsp90s from different organisms have peculiarities despite their high sequence identity. Therefore, a detailed comparative analysis of several Hsp90 proteins is relevant to the overall understanding of their activity. Accordingly, the goal of this work was to evaluate the interaction of either ADP or ATP with recombinant Hsp90s from different organisms (human α and β isoforms, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania braziliensis, yeast and sugarcane) by isothermal titration calorimetry. The measured thermodynamic signatures of those interactions indicated that despite the high identity among all Hsp90s, they have specific thermodynamic characteristics. Specifically, the interactions with ADP are driven by enthalpy but are opposed by entropy, whereas the interaction with ATP is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. Complimentary structural and molecular dynamics studies suggested that specific interactions with ADP that differ from those with ATP may contribute to the observed enthalpies and entropies. Altogether, the data suggest that selective inhibition may be more easily achieved using analogues of the Hsp90-ADP bound state than those of Hsp90-ATP bound state. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Randomized experiment is an important tool for studying the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). This paper considers the regression adjustment estimation of the Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) in high-dimensional case, where the multicollinearity problem is often encountered and needs to be properly handled. Many existing regression adjustment methods fail to achieve satisfactory performances. To solve this issue, an Elastic-net adjusted estimator for SATE is proposed under the Rubin causal model of randomized experiments with multicollinearity in high dimensions. The asymptotic properties of the proposed SATE estimator are shown under some regularity conditions, and the asymptotic variance is proved to be not greater than that of the unadjusted estimator. Furthermore, Neyman-type conservative estimators for the asymptotic variance are proposed, which yields tighter confidence intervals than both the unadjusted and the Lasso-based adjusted estimators. Some simulation studies are carried out to show that the Elastic-net adjusted method is better in addressing collinearity problem than the existing methods. The advantages of our proposed method are also shown in analyzing the dataset of HER2 breast cancer patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) analysis of an ultrasensitive In 2 O 5 Sn gate (transparent gate) recessed channel (TGRC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) as a biosensor for early-stage disease diagnostics. The key parameters such as sensitivity, switching ratio, and threshold voltage shift have been compared with the conventional MOSFET. For immobilizing the protein molecules, a cavity has been embedded in the gate insulator region due to which gate capacitance changes owing to the accumulation of protein molecules which reflects the deviation in threshold voltage. Higher sensitivity (1.542) is achieved for protein at a very low drain bias (0.2 V) in comparison to streptavidin and APTES ((3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane). Moreover, the cavity gap variation (from 8 to 15 nm) and oxide thickness limitation has also been observed for the device as a biosensor. All the results pave way for early detection techniques of protein-related diseases such as Alzheimer's diseases, ovarian cancer and coronary artery disease with the existing complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation status of E2BSs in the HPV 16 long control region (LCR) in clinical cervical samples. Methods: Methylation status of the four E2BSs in 43 clinical cervical samples with HPV 16 infection was quantitatively detected using pyrosequencing. Meanwhile, Quantivirus® HPV E6/E7 RNA 3.0 assay (bDNA) was used to detect E6/E7 mRNA levels in the corresponding specimens. Results: Our results showed that methylation status of E2BS1, 2 and 4 sites in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and cervical cancer were significantly higher than that of asymptomatic HPV 16 infection and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) (all P &lt;.05). Furthermore, methylation status of HPV 16 E2BS1 and 2 was positively correlated with E6/E7 mRNA levels (r s = 0.529 and 0.512 respectively, P &lt;.01). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic performance of E2BSs methylation. When the Youden index was the maximum value, the methylation level of E2BS1 and E2BS2 all demonstrated optimum diagnostic sensitivity of 77.8%, and specificity of 80% and 92%, respectively. Conclusions: The methylation status of E2BS1 and 2 may have utility as diagnostic markers for the severity of cervical lesions in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of pyroptosis in the cryopreservation and transplantation of mouse ovarian tissues; the effects of pyroptosis inhibitior on the ovarian graft function were also explored. ICR (institute of cancer research) mice were randomly divided into control group and experimental groups (n = 10 per group). The experimental groups included fresh graft group (autograft), cryopreserved graft group (cryopreservation + autograft), and pyroptosis inhibition group (cryopreservation + autograft + pyroptosis inhibitor). At the third day after auto-transplantation, caspase-1 and NLRP3 protein expression in grafts were assessed by Western blot; in the meantime, serum concentration of IL-1β was examined by ELISA. After 28 days of auto-transplantation, estradiol concentrations and follicular densities of grafts were evaluated. The caspase-1 and NLRP3 protein expression in grafts from all the experimental groups were significantly higher than that from control group respectively; moreover, there was a significant increase in serum concentrations of IL-1β in all experimental groups compared with control group. The concentration of estradiol and follicular densities of grafts in pyroptosis inhibition group were significantly higher than that in cryopreserved graft group. Pyroptosis is involved in cryopreservation and auto-transplantation of mouse ovarian tissues, and pyroptosis inhibition can improve the ovarian graft function. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we used anti-cancer flutamide (FM) as a radical pair-forming drug to investigate whether magnetic fields can control a liposomal drug release through differences in the physical properties of biomembranes. Irradiations of FM-incorporated liposomal nanoparticles (FM-LNs) were performed using an original air-cooled UV-LED irradiation system. Exposure to a static magnetic field of 0.2 T was performed using a pair of commercially available permanent magnets. For evaluating the drug-release potentials with spin-correlated radical pair mechanisms on the photochemical reactions developing in biomembranes, we prepared various types of FM-LNs equipped with possible magnetic controls. According to the overall result of the prepared FM-LNs, the drug release is deemed not to be caused by only the pair mechanisms. But the tests observing the magnetic field effects on the mechanisms must provide useful information on drug targeting. We strongly propose a new drug-release technology using these liposomal nanoparticles equipped with magnetic controls. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A recent epidemiological study suggested that chronic exposure to cleaning detergents significantly reduced lung function in consumers. In this study, we identified the toxic mechanism of ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS), the most common detergent in consumer products, using alveolar macrophage cells. In preliminary tests, cell viability sharply decreased between 40 and 200 μg/mL, thus we determined doses of 10, 20, and 50 μg/mL for further study. When treated at a 50 μg/mL for 24 h, cell viability was 67.7 ± 3.4% of the control, and autophagosome-like vacuoles and a number of double membranes surrounding damaged mitochondria were observed in the cytosol. Intracellular ROS, the ATP amount, ER volume, acid cell compartments and mitochondrial potential rapidly reduced with dose, whereas the release of LDH and apoptotic bodies dramatically increased. Additionally, multiple cell death pathways were activated following exposure to ALS, and the expression of caveolin-1, p-Acetyl CoA carboxylase, p21, and p-ERK were greatly inhibited. Moreover, the secretion of inflammatory mediators and expression of innate- and adaptive-immune response-related proteins were remarkably reduced. Meanwhile, the secretion of TGF-β was enhanced. Therefore, we conclude that ALS-induced apoptosis may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by the inhibition of caveolin-1, and that chronic pulmonary exposure to ALS may cause adverse health effects such as cancer and fibrosis by impairing the host's pulmonary immune system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Animal secretions are of great interest in terms of drug development due to their complex protein and peptide composition. Especially, in the field of therapeutic medications such as anti-cancer drugs snake venoms receive attention. In this study, we address two Viperidae species from various habitats with a particular focus on the cytotoxic potential along with the decomplexation of the venom proteome: the horned desert viper (Cerastes cerastes), native to desert regions of North Africa and the mangrove pit viper (Cryptelytrops purpureomaculatus), found in coastal forests of Southeast Asia. Initial cytotoxic screenings of the crude venoms revealed diverse activity, with the highest effect against SHSY5Y human glioblastoma carcinoma cells compared to other cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines. In-depth cytotoxicity studies of SHSY5Y cells with purified venom fractions revealed heterodimeric disintegrins from C. cerastes venom, which exerted a high cytotoxic activity with IC 50 values from 0.11 to 0.58 μM and a disintegrin-like effect on SHSY5Y morphology was observed due to cell detachment. Furthermore, two polyproline BPP-related peptides, one PLA 2 and a peptide-rich fraction were determined for C. purpureomaculatus with moderate IC 50 values between 3 and 51 μM. Additionally, the decryption of the venom proteomes by snake venomic mass spectrometry and comparison of the same species from different habitats revealed slight differences in the composition. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Nanocomposites of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) generate heat under an alternating magnetic field and therefore have potential applications as thermoseeds for cancer hyperthermia treatment. However, the properties of such nanocomposites as biomaterials have not been sufficiently well characterized. In this study, the osteoconductivity of Fe 3 O 4 -rGO nanocomposites of various compositions was evaluated in vitro in terms of their apatite-forming ability in simulated body fluid (SBF). Furthermore, the heat generation of the nanocomposites was measured under an alternating magnetic field. The apatite-forming ability in SBF improved as the Fe 3 O 4 content in the nanocomposite was increased. As the Fe 3 O 4 content was increased, the nanocomposite not only rapidly raised the surrounding temperature to approximately 100 °C, but the specific absorption rate also increased. We assumed that the ionic interaction between the Fe 3 O 4 and rGO was enhanced and that Brown relaxation was suppressed as the proportion of rGO in the nanocomposite was increased. Consequently, a high content of Fe 3 O 4 in the nanocomposite was effective for improving both the osteoconductivity and heat generation characteristics for hyperthermia applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We introduce for first time a facile protocol for the rapid synthesis of a molybdenum nanoclusters (MoNCs) at room temperature using thiolated dithiothreitol (DTT) as capping agents. The initial fluorescence from the MoNCs is observed in 30 min and further intensified in 48 h. The mean diameter of nanoclusters was found to be 1.5 nm with −77 mV zeta potential. The nanoclusters have good stability in all tested pH ranges, especially between pH 7 and 10. This property makes the nanomaterial to be ideal for many types of possible biological/biomedicine applications such as drug delivery or biological imaging. The quantum yield of thiolated MoNCs was calculated to be 59% which is higher than the noble metal nanoclusters reported earlier. The mechanism of formation of MoNCs was investigated using the UV–Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Owing to these characteristics, MoNCs were used for imaging of HaCaT and A549 cancer cells. The current approach on novel synthesis of MoNCs is found to be a superior alternative to conventional/popular MoS 2 based on the method of synthesis, particle size, and fluorescence quantum yield. The current approach on the MoNCs has created a new platform for future biomedicine applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A 2-year inhalation rat and mouse cancer study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) on 1-bromopropane, a brominated solvent most commonly used as a vapor degreaser, showed significant increase in tumors in the lung of female mice and in the large intestine of male and female rats. The most sensitive endpoint was lung tumors in female mice. Mice of both sexes had hyperplasia and inflammation of the nose and showed regeneration of lung tissue. The NTP assumed that these tumors were due to genotoxic effects and that a linear dose-response relationship was appropriate. It is plausible that, similar to chloroform, hyperplasia and inflammation are required as initial events for tumor development. If true, then a threshold-based model may be more appropriate for 1-bromopropane. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day repeat dose inhalation Big Blue ® Assay was conducted using female transgenic B6C3F1 mice. The target exposure concentrations and the exposure regimen were identical to those used by the NTP. Results demonstrated no elevation in mutant frequency of the cII transgene in lung, colon, or liver. Positive controls produced statistically significant increases in mutant frequencies across all tested tissues. These results demonstrate that 1-bromopropane does not induce cII mutants in lungs, colon, or liver under the testing conditions. These data have important ramifications in the quantitative evaluation of tumor results for this chemical and support a mechanism of action where a threshold for carcinogenicity is plausible. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The genus Bauhinia belongs to the family Fabaceae and comprises about 18,000 known species in the world. In Brazil, approximately more than 60 native species of Bauhinia are found. Bauhinia leaves tea infusion or other preparations have been widely used in the Brazilian popular medicine for treatment of several illnesses. Therefore, this work aims to a better understanding of Bauhinia longifolia to provide a valuable database for its quality control, pharmacological and toxicological studies. For the chemical analysis, a liquid chromatography-high resolution quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer method was applied to evaluate the chemical profile of Bauhinia longifolia ethanolic leaves extracts, allowing for the identification of 75 compounds comprising chemical classes of phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, and O-glycosides flavonoids. Most polyphenols were identified for the first time in this specie. In addition, six compounds were isolated and fully identified by liquid chromatography hyphenate to solid phase extraction and nuclear magnetic resonance. Herein, myricitrin, juglanin, afzelin, and bauhiniastatin 2 are reported for the first time for Bauhinia longifolia. Bauhiniastatin 2 has been reported to display anticancer properties towards several cancer cell lines. The chemical profile herein described for the ethanolic leaves extract of Bauhinia longifolia provided essential information of this Brazilian native species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The well-known and effective anthelmintic oxibendazole was recently shown to have a broad spectrum of biological abilities, such as anti-cancer and anti-inflammation activities. In contrast, the mechanism of oxibendazole's anti-proliferative effect via cell signaling pathways and its role in pre-implantation has not been studied. Therefore, in this study we demonstrated the effects of oxibendazole on the proliferation of porcine trophectoderm (pTr) cells and porcine luminal epithelial (pLE) cells, a well-known in vitro model system of the fetal-maternal interface. Cell proliferation decreased in both pTr and pLE cells in response to oxibendazole, and we determined that this was modulated through intracellular cell signal transduction. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P90RSK, and S6 were downregulated by exposure to a 200 nM dose of oxibendazole in both types of cells, while the expression of phosphorylated JNK, AKT, and P70S6K was upregulated. Pre-treatment with a PI3K/AKT inhibitor (Wortmannin), ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), and JNK inhibitor (SP600125) induced the signaling interactions of these molecules, and oxibendazole co-treatment with each inhibitor resulted in even greater decreases in cell proliferation. Furthermore, intracellular and mitochondrial calcium ion accumulation was observed, which would mean that calcium ion homeostasis was disrupted, causing damage to the mitochondrial membrane potential. These deteriorated conditions ultimately led to apoptotic cell death. Taken together, the results of the present study identified that the apoptotic effect of oxibendazole on pTr and pLE cells is regulated by cell signaling pathways, and thus oxibendazole could influence the connection between the conceptus and the maternal uterus. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Enzootic bovine haematuria, caused by long-term ingestion of ferns, is a chronic disease of hill cattle characterized by neoplastic lesions in the urinary bladder. Objectives of this study were to investigate the toxicity potential of long-term feeding of the fern Dryopteris nigropalaceae and effect of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) to ameliorate fern toxicity and the associated pathological changes. The LC-MS analysis of the fern showed presence of ptaquiloside (4.5 ± 1.0 μg/g) and pterosin B (39 ± 9.1 μg/g). Groups of animals were fed dried fern powder at the dose of 20% w/w in normal feed and treated with and without AITC at graded doses. Long term feeding of fern induced inflammatory and pre-neoplastic lesions in urinary bladder. The important lesions included cystitis, squamous metaplasia and high-grade dysplasia. Urothelium showed positive immunoreactions for nuclear expression of H-ras and p53. However, no mutation suggestive of neoplastic change was observed on partial mRNA sequences analyses of exon 2 of H-ras and 5 or 7&8 of p53 genes. Strikingly, AITC showed dose-dependent amelioration of pre-neoplastic changes in fern-fed animals. In conclusion, AITC is shown to limit pre-neoplastic changes caused by D. nigropalaceae feeding in guinea pigs. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Earlier publication from the ongoing multi-centric study of the International Agency for Research on Cancer to evaluate less than three doses of the quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in India amongst unmarried girls demonstrated non-inferior total antibody titres, neutralizing antibody titres and antibody avidity in 2-dose recipients compared to 3-dose recipients at 15–18 years of age (Bhatla et al., 2018) [7]. The number of participants recruited at 15–18 years of age was 1515 and 1795 in the 3-dose and the 2-dose groups respectively. At a median follow-up of 7 years, incident HPV 16/18 infections were detected in 1.6% women receiving two doses and 0.8% women receiving three doses at 15–18 years. Frequency of incident infection was 7.0% in the age- and site-matched unvaccinated women (N = 1484). No persistent infection from HPV 16 was observed in the 2- or 3-dose recipients and one (0.2%) persistent HPV 18 infection was documented, each in the 3-dose and 2-dose cohorts. Among the unvaccinated women, the frequency of HPV 16/18 persistent infection was 1.7%. The protection offered by two doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine against incident and persistent infections in recipients at 15–18 years is comparable to that seen in 3-dose recipients at 15–18 years. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Arsenic contamination has raised great concern around the world as the cause of many severe health issues, including internal and external cancers. Discharging arsenic waste into the environment before proper handling is strictly forbidden. In order to treat the arsenic-bearing wastes in a safe way, we used the oxidation alkali leaching to dissolve arsenic in the low-risk state arsenate (AsO 4 3− ) firstly, followed by recycling of the alkali solution after arsenate removal. In this paper, we synthesized high-concentrated ferric oxyhydroxide gels (HFGs) with different supersaturation in a hydrothermal system to adsorb arsenate anions at high alkali without consuming the hydroxyls. The arsenate adsorption onto HFGs followed the pseudo second-order and intra-particle diffusion kinetics and fitted Langmuir isotherms model well. Through characterization of the synthesized HFGs particles by XRD, Raman spectra, SEM and TGA, it was confirmed that the surface hydroxyl sites on the ferric oxyhydroxide reacted with arsenates to form the bidentate surface complexation. In addition, the synthesized HFG at lower supersaturation had lower crystallinity and more surface hydroxyl sites, resulting in higher adsorption capacity for arsenate. Using HFG as the adsorbent, the arsenic (V) concentration in the copper slag alkali leaching solution can be reduced from 2084 mg/L to 71.8 mg/L, which can realize stabilization of the high-concentrated arsenate at high alkali and alkali solution recycling. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Metallic therapeutic agents have been widely used in cancer therapy. Iron-based phases that work in concert with porous grafts provide promising strategies for chemotherapy and bone repair after surgery. However, seldom are studies associated to the involvement of extrinsic iron ions in the essential angiogenesis of implantation. In this work, we fabricated a novel iron-loaded biocomposite scaffold with hierarchical channels toward unraveling the influence of Fe 3+ release on the angiogenic response of bone grafts. Iron-doped octacalcium phosphate (Fe-OCP) as a viable controllable ferric agent was prepared by homogeneous precipitation through hydrolysis of carbamide. The intervention of Fe 3+ altered the crystallochemical properties of OCP with preferential growth of plane (h 0 0) and inhibition growth of plane (0 0 l). Fe-OCP significantly promoted the affinity, viability, proliferation, and angiogenic differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffold with Fe-OCP showed enhanced deposition of bone-like apatites and sustained Fe 3+ release under simulated physiological environment. The scaffold supported endothelial cells adhesion and spreading, and notably enhanced angiogenesis with more blood vessels formation and higher specific markers expression. Results suggest that Fe 3+ can increase HIF-1α levels and VEGF expression, and promote NO secretion and eNOS production, thus mediating endothelial cells behaviors and angiogenesis. These findings illuminate the remarkable angiogenic capability of iron-loaded grafts for potential cancerous bone repair, which paves the way for developing functionalized bone grafts in therapeutic biomaterials applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: We report four cases of spinal Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) that were managed surgically at King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. This report aims to describe the clinical features and the need for surgical excision preceded by embolization in spinal ABC. Method: A retrospective review of the OR list and tumor board records between 2013 and 2016 yielded a total of 4 cases of spinal ABC who were surgically treated at KFSH-D. Their clinical presentations, radiological and pathological features are reviewed along with the surgical intervention utilized and its outcome. Results: Total of 4 cases were identified, all of them were female (100%). The age ranged from 13 to 25 years old (mean age = 17.75). Two cases (50%) were located in the thoracic spine, one (25%) cervical and one (25%) in the lumbar spine. Back pain, unsteady gait, and progressive limb weakness were the most common presenting symptoms. All the cases underwent embolization followed by surgical excision and fixation with a variable degree of improvement postoperatively. Conclusion: Spinal ABC is a benign tumor that can present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms. Pre-operative embolization can be helpful to reduce bleeding during surgery. Surgical decompression can lead to significant improvement even in case of severe neurological deficit. Radiation therapy can be used as an adjunct treatment in selected cases. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drugs including erlotinib cause a side effect of hypomagnesemia. In lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, anticancer agents such as cisplatin and doxorubicin dose-dependently increased toxicity, but the effects were significantly suppressed by culturing the cells in low Mg 2+ -containing media. To obtain the maximum effect in cancer chemotherapy, it should be necessary to prevent the reduction of body Mg 2+ content. Anti-EGFR drugs inhibit EGF-induced elevation of transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6) Mg 2+ channel in renal tubular epithelial NRK-52E cells. Here, we found that rosiglitazone, an antidiabetic drug, and all- trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a vitamin A derivative, increase the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of TRPM6 in the presence of erlotinib. The rosiglitazone- and ATRA-induced elevation of mRNA level, Mg 2+ influx, and promoter activity of TRPM6 were inhibited by GW-9662, a potent antagonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, and LE135, a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist, respectively. Rosiglitazone increased the phosphorylation and nuclear localization levels of PPARγ, which were inhibited by GW-9662. In contrast, RAR was mainly distributed in the nuclei under control conditions, which was unchanged by ATRA and LE135. The promoter activity of TRPM6 was inhibited by a mutation in the peroxisome proliferator hormone response element (PPRE). A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that PPARγ and RAR bind to the PPRE, which was blocked by GW-9662 and LE135, respectively. These results suggest that rosiglitazone and ATRA reverse the reduction in Mg 2+ reabsorption caused by anti-EGFR drugs. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Distinct metastasis is one of the main causes of breast cancer (BC)-related mortality and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a primary step in metastasis dissemination. On the other hand, doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent against BC; unfortunately, its clinical use is limited by dose-dependent side effects. Therefore, extensive efforts have been dedicated to suppressing metastasis of BC and also to overcome DOX side effects together with keeping its antitumor efficacy. Studies supported the role of oleuropein (OLEU) in reducing DOX-induced side effects besides its antitumor actions. In this study, the antimigratory effect of OLEU was assessed and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect OLEU effect on the expression level of EMT markers, in MCF-7 cells. The cytotoxic effect of OLEU and DOX was assessed by MTT assay, whereas the ratio of apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry. The results showed that migration ability of MCF-7 cells remarkably decreased in OLEU treated group and RT-PCR results showed that OLEU may exert its antimigratory action by suppressing EMT through downregulation of sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Also, the results indicated that both OLEU and DOX were cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells, whereas DOX-OLEU cotreatment led to additive cytotoxicity and apoptosis rate. This study provides evidence regarding the suppressive role of OLEU on MCF-7 cells migration ability through suppression of EMT, and for the first time, it was proposed that SIRT1 downregulation can be involved in the OLEU antimigratory effect. Also, the findings demonstrated that OLEU can reduce DOX-induced side effects by reducing its effective dose. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "We report here that the androgen receptor (AR) and ABCB1 are upregulated in a model of acquired taxol resistance (txr) in ovarian carcinoma cells. AR silencing sensitizes txr cells to taxol threefold, whereas ectopic AR expression in AR-null HEK293 cells induces resistance to taxol by 1.7-fold. AR activation using the agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or sublethal taxol treatment upregulates ABCB1 expression in both txr cells and AR-expressing HEK293 cells. In contrast, AR inactivation using the antagonist bicalutamide downregulates ABCB1 expression and enhances cytotoxicity to taxol. A functional ABCB1 promoter containing five predicted androgen-response elements (AREs) is cloned. Deletion assays reveal a taxol-responsive promoter segment which harbors ARE4. Notably, DHT- or taxol-activated AR potentiates binding of the AR to ARE4 as revealed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation. On the other hand, txr cells display an increase in chromatin remodeling. AR/H3K9ac and AR/H3K14ac complexes bind specifically to ARE4 in response to taxol. Furthermore, acetyltransferase protein levels (p300 and GCN5) are upregulated in txr cells. Silencing of p300 or GCN5 reduces chromatin modification and enhances cytotoxicity in both parental and txr SKOV3 cells. While the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) pathway is significantly activated by taxol, taxol-induced ABCB1 expression, histone posttranslational modifications, and p300 binding to ARE4 are suppressed following inhibition of the PI3K/AKT cellular pathway. These results demonstrate that the AKT/p300/AR axis can be activated to target ABCB1 gene expression in response to taxol, thus revealing a new treatment target to counter taxol resistance. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Non-ionic surfactants have raised a considerable interest for solubilization, encapsulation, permeabilization and controlled release of various compounds due to their unique physicochemical properties. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to create convenient self-assembled multifunctional materials with high solubilization and encapsulation capacities by preserving their advanced capabilities to protect loaded cargos without altering their characteristics. In this work, we present an extended concept of micellar clusters (MCs) formation based on partial entrapment and stabilization of chelate ligands by hydrophobic forces found on the non-ionic surfactant micelle interface of the Triton-X family (TX-100/TX-114), followed by subsequent complexation of the preformed structures either by metal ions or a supporting chelator. The formation aspects, inner structure and the role of external factors such as the addition of competitive ligands have been extensively studied. MCs loaded by hydrophobic fluorescent compounds with high encapsulation efficiency demonstrate an excellent optical response in aqueous media without crystallization as well as sufficient increase in solubility of toxic hydrophobic compounds such as bilirubin (>50 times compared to pure surfactants). Furthermore, Triton-X-based MCs provide a unique feature of selective permeability to hydrophilic ligand-switching proteins such as UnaG and BSA demonstrating bright “turn-on” fluorescence signal either inside the cluster or on its interface via complexation. The proposed strategies allowed us to successfully encapsulate and visualize a newly synthesized, highly hydrophobic anticancer PTR-58-CLB-CAMP peptide drug, while MCs loaded by the drug exhibit a considerable antitumor activity against HeLa cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Recently, drug delivery using natural and biodegradable nanoparticles has attracted huge attention. This study focused to deliver an anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug Ginsenoside Rb1 through chitosan-Alginate nanocomposite film prepared by solution method. Ginsenoside Rb1 is a dammaran saponin group, which is extracted from an herbaceous plant Panax notoginseng. Ginsenoside loaded alginate-chitosan nanocomposite films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. The FTIR spectra of alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films show that chitosan, alginate, and ginsenoside Rb1 are linked through the hydrogen bonding and dipolar-dipolar interactions. The FESEM image indicates that the chitosan and ginsenoside Rb1 dispersed well in the alginate matrix. The DSC diagrams display that melting temperature of alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films higher than that of chitosan and lower than that of alginate. It means that alginate and chitosan interact together. Investigation of the ginsenoside Rb1 release from alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films at different pH solutions and different ginsenoside Rb1 content has been carried out by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy method. The rate of drug release is proportional to the increase in pH solution and inversely proportional to the content of loaded ginsenoside Rb1. The Rb1 release process includes two stages: burst release in the first 10 hours, then constant release afterwards. The suitable ratio of alginate/chitosan to prepare the alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films for further investigations was found out to be 8:2. Ginsenoside Rb1 release process from alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films was believed to be first-order kinetics in the first stage, and then the Rb1 release complies with Higuchi kinetic model in the slow release stage. This study demonstrated the novel synthesis methodology to design drug delivery system based on ginsenoside Rb1 loaded to chitosan/alginate nanocomposite films.",

    "Abstract": "Fluoride is very crucial for development of teeth and bones. Excessive fluoride, however, causes damage to teeth and bones resulting in serious public health problem. SIRT1 regulates physiological and pathological processes such as apoptosis and cell cycle. Although SIRT1 inhibits p53-mediated transactivation, how SIRT1 regulates p53 in fluorosis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the involvement of SIRT1 in fluoride-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells and the underlying mechanism. Cell apoptosis was determined using Annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining, cell cycle detected with PI staining, intracellular ROS levels measured with DCFH-DA probe, and apoptosis-related protein expressions determined using Western blotting. Results showed that there was a promotion in apoptosis rate, intracellular ROS levels, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, protein expression (Cyt c, Caspase-3, p53, Ac-p53 and p21) and blockage of S phase after cells were exposed to NaF. Afterwards, the influence of SIRT1 on apoptosis was explored after SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator) and Ex-527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) was introduced. Results indicated that SRT1720 in combination with fluoride significantly decreased the intracellular ROS levels, the protein expression of Caspase-3, Ac-p53 and p21 and alleviated apoptosis, while it was reversed by Ex-527. Collectively, SIRT1 plays an essential role in protection against fluoride-induced oxidative stress and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells. The SIRT1/p53/p21 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for fluorosis. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains remains a severe threat for the public health, which prompts strict restrictions on the uses of antifungal drugs. However, the majority of lipophilic fungistatic agents are poorly water soluble with a low oral adsorption characteristic posing challenges for the precise prescriptions. In this study, a natural antimicrobial cationic peptide of epsilon-poly-L-lysine (EPL) decorated ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15) was facilely prepared for the efficient loading of antifungal itraconazole (ITZ) drugs. The characterized mesoporous SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composite exhibited remarkable antifungal performance against Aspergillus fumigatus as a model mold, which was attributed to synergistic antifungal activities of ITZ and EPL in the mesopores. Moreover, the in vitro release behaviors of ITZ in the composite nanoexcipients both in simulated gastric fluid and fasted state simulated intestinal fluid were studied. The observed release kinetics of ITZ demonstrated a contributing role of SBA-15/EPL to enhance the solubility of ITZ and thereby may promote its flux across the gastrointestinal epithelium, which is beneficial for the absorption of drugs. Additionally, SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composites showed desirable biocompatibility toward mammalian red blood cells, human cervical cancer cells (Hela) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profiles of obtained nano-formulations were assessed in rats, among which the improved adsorption of SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composites (AUC 0–24h sum : 8381.7 nM·h) was identified compared with that of pure ITZ (525.1 nM·h) and the commercial drug of Sporanox (7516.6 nM·h). Collectively, the prepared SBA-15/EPL/ITZ provides an ecofriendly and integrated nanocomposite with enhanced solubility of lipophilic drugs to combat proliferations of infectious fungi. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Extensive investigations into long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various diseases and cancers, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been conducted. The current study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA solute carrier family 8 member A1 antisense RNA 1 (SLC8A1-AS1) in myocardial damage by targeting solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1) via cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-protein kinase G (cGMP-PKG) signaling pathway in AMI mouse models. Differentially expressed lncRNA in AMI were initially screened and target relationship between lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1 and SLC8A1 was then verified. Infarct size, levels of inflammatory factors, biochemical indicators, and the positive expression of the SLC8A1 protein in AMI were subsequently determined. The expression of SLC8A1-AS1, SLC8A1, PKG1, PKG2, atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide was detected to assess the effect of SLC8A1-AS1 on SLC8A1 and cGMP-PKG. The respective contents of superoxide dismutase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected accordingly. Microarray data GSE66360 provided evidence indicating that SLC8A1-AS1 was poorly expressed in AMI. SLC8A1 was verified to be a target gene of lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1. SLC8A1-AS1 upregulation decreased levels of left ventricular end-systolic diameter, −dp/ dt max , interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, transforming growth factor α, nitric oxide, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, infarct size, LDH activity and MDA content, and increased IL-10, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and + dp/ dt max . Furthermore, the overexpression of SLC8A1-AS1 was noted to elicit an inhibitory effect on the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway via SLC8A1. In conclusion, lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1, by downregulating SLC8A1 and activating the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, was observed to alleviate myocardial damage, inhibit the release of proinflammatory factors and reduce infarct size, ultimately protecting against myocardial damage. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: We performed a retrospective non-randomized study to analyze the results of microsurgery of vestibular schwannomas (VS) using 2μ-Thulium flexible hand-held laser fiber (Revolix jr®). Methods: From September 2010 to November 2018, 180 patients suffering from VS have been operated on with microsurgical technique via retrosigmoid (RS) approach in our Department. From July 2012 to April 2018, tumor resection was performed in 78 cases with the assistance of 2μ-Thulium-fiber hand-held flexible laser. Facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann (HB) scale preoperatively, 1 week postoperatively, and 6-month after surgery. Results: Overall time from incision to skin suture changed in relation to size of tumor (185–575 min) and was not affected by the use of laser. In 5 out of 78 cases preoperative facial nerve palsy HB2 and in one case HB4 (permanent) was observed. On considering 77 cases (excluding 1 permanent HB4) with a minimum 6-month follow-up, facial nerve preservation rate (HB1) was 92,2%. Hearing preservation rate (AAO-HNS A/B classes) was possible in 17 out of 30 cases (56,7%). Adopting a 0–3-scale, the mean surgeon satisfaction rate of usefulness of laser fiber was 2,75. Conclusions: The use of 2μ-Thulium-fiber hand-held flexible laser in VS-microsurgery seems to be safe and to facilitate tumor resection, especially in “difficult” conditions (e.g., highly vascularized and hard tumors). In this retrospective trial, the good functional outcome following conventional microsurgery had not further improved, nor the surgical time reduced by laser. Focusing its use on “difficult” (large and vascularized) cases may lead to different results in future. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Greener nanotechnology plays an important role in developing alternative and effective treatment strategies for various diseases. Biological synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) has known to possess suitable alternatives than the existing chemical methods. Greener synthesis of MNPs by using plant extracts has become an emerging field due to their safe, eco-friendly and non-toxic nature that are suitable for synergistic biological activities. Hence, the greener method is chosen by the present study. In the present study, the greener synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was successfully done by using Coleus aromaticus leaf extract at three different temperatures (30 °C, 60 °C and 100 °C). The formation of AuNPs was initially monitored by visual observation and then characterized with the help of diverse techniques like UV–Vis spectroscopy (UV–Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak and crystalline nature of AuNPs were obtained by UV–Vis and XRD spectroscopies respectively. FT-IR analysis shows the different characteristic functional groups in turn responsible for the bio-reduction of gold ions by using leaf extract. The formations of different nano-sized AuNPs with their different morphologies were observed by SEM and HR-TEM analyses. Surface charge and stability of the AuNPs were measured by zeta potential and DLS respectively. The synthesized AuNPs coated with cotton fabric was analyzed by UV-Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-DRS), which revealed excellent UV protection against UV radiation. The AuNPs coated cotton fabric exhibited remarkable antibacterial sensitivity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Further, the synthesized AuNPs showed significant cytotoxicity against human liver cancer (HepG2) cell line. The findings of this study revealed that, AuNPs synthesized using Coleus aromaticus leaf extract could be an alternative, safe, and effective source of UV protection, antibacterial and anticancer agents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Automatic disease classification has been one of the most intensively searched in recent years due to the possibility of quickly providing a diagnosis to the patient. In this process, the segmentation of regions of interest of these diseases has a fundamental role in their subsequent classification. With skin lesions segmentation it is no different and in recent years many studies have achieved interesting results, becoming an important tool in aiding the medical diagnosis of skin diseases. In this work, a morphological geodesic active contour segmentation (MGAC) method is proposed with automatic initialization, using mathematical morphology which is a great partial differential equation approximation, with lower computational cost, no stability problems and fully automatic. The proposed method was tested in a stable and well-known dermoscopic images database provided by Pedro Hispano Hospital (PH2) and was compared with both methods that make use of machine learning or deep learning techniques such as fully convolutional networks (FCN), full resolution convolutional networks (FrCN), deep class-specific learning with probability based step-wise integration (DCL-PSI), and others, and also traditional methods like JSEG, statistical region merging (SRM), Level Set, ASLM and others. The MGAC showed good results in all similarity metrics compared in this work like Jaccard Index (86.16%), Dice coefficient (92.09%) and Matthew correlation coefficient (87.52%), and also achieves good results in sensitivity (91.72%), specificity (97.99%), accuracy (94.59%) and F-measure (93.82%). Thus, the proposed method presented better results in relation to all these metrics when compared to the traditional methods and still presented better results in relation to the methods that use machine learning or deep learning techniques in Jaccard Index, Dice coefficient and specificity. This confirm that the MGAC can efficiently segment skin lesions, presenting great potential to be applied in the aid of the medical diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a novel sensor based on immobilised copper phthalocyanine, 2,9,16,23-tetracarboxylic acid-polyacrylamide (Cu(II)TC Pc-PAA) was developed for determination of acid phosphatase (ACP) levels in nanomolar quantities. Detection was based on the measurement of enzymatically generated phosphate, with initial studies focused on phosphate detection at a Cu(II)TC Pc-PAA modified screen-printed gold transducer. The sensor was characterised in relation to operational performance (pH, response time, stability, linearity, and sensitivity) and common anionic interferents (nitrate, sulphate, chloride, and perchlorate). The functionalised surface also facilitated rapid detection of the enzyme bi-product 2-naphthol over the range 5–3000 μM. Quantitation of ACP was demonstrated, realising a linear response range of 0.5–20 nM and LOD of 0.5 nM, which is within the clinical range for this prostate cancer biomarker. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The International Agency for Research on Cancer recently classified cured meats as carcinogenic for humans and red meats as probably carcinogenic. Mutagens can be formed during meat process or digestion. In a previous study, we used a dynamic artificial digestive system (DIDGI®) to investigate protein oxidation and N-nitrosation during bovine meat digestion. This new paper completes the previous one by focusing on the endogenous heme iron nitrosylation. Low nitrosylation due to nitrate initially present in meat and to ammonia oxidation in the stomach was observed in the digestive tract even in conditions in which no nitrite was added to the model. The endogenous addition of nitrite (1 mM) considerably increased heme iron nitrosylation while a significant decrease was observed with prior meat cooking (30 min at 60 and 90 °C). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most widespread commonly used broad-spectrum herbicides that contaminate soils and waters, are toxic to bacteria, plants and animals, and have been classified as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’ by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015. Particular soil bacteria and fungi can degrade GBHs, hence, search for new GBH-degrading strains or microbial consortia, effective under specific growth conditions and local environment, seems to be a promising solution for bio-remediation of glyphosate-contaminated environment. Consequently, there is a need for rapid and informative methods to evaluate the GBH-induced changes of the metabolic pathways in cells, that may serve as indicators of GBH-degrading potential. Three new GBH-degrading bacterial strains, Pseudomonas sp., Actinobacteria and Serratia sp. were isolated from sludge of municipal waste water treatment plant (Daugavgriva, Riga, Latvia), agricultural soil and plant tissue, respectively. This study examined the response of these isolates to elevated concentrations of glyphosate (GLP) (100 and 500 mg/L) in GBH Klinik® 360 SL. The GBH-induced shift of metabolic activity in cells of Pseudomonas sp. was shown by tests on EcoPlates™. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses were used to evaluate the metabolomic response of bacteria to elevated concentrations of GBH in the growth environment. The spectra of Pseudomonas sp. and Serratia sp., incubated with and without GBH, were similar, thus indicating their GBH-resistance. The absorption at 1736 cm −1 , assigned to ester carbonyl stretch vibrations, was detected in spectra of all three bacteria. The highest ester content was detected in Actinobacteria grown in medium with 1.0% molasses and 100 or 500 mg/L GLP in GBH Klinik®. An increase of cellular amounts of esters, either those of phospholipids or poly-β-hydroxybutyrates, indicates degradation of GLP. Therefore, monitoring the ester carbonyl stretch vibration band in FTIR spectra of bacterial biomass may speed up the search GBH-degrading strains. Microbiological tests and cell metabolic response studies by FTIR spectroscopy showed that the three new isolates of Pseudomonas sp., Actinobacteria and Serratia sp. were resistant to elevated concentrations of GBH Klinik® in growth environment and exhibited the potential for GBH degradation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "IκB kinase subunit epsilon (IKKε), a key component of NFκB and interferon signalling, has been identified as a breast cancer oncogene. Here we report that the IKKε/TBK1 axis plays a role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer osteolytic metastasis. Cancer-specific knockdown of IKKε in the human MDA-MB-231-BT cells and treatment with the verified IKKε/TBK1 inhibitor Amlexanox reduced skeletal tumour growth and osteolysis in mice. In addition, combined administration of Amlexanox with Docetaxel reduced mammary tumour growth of syngeneic 4T1 cells, inhibited metastases and improved survival in mice after removal of the primary tumour. Functional and mechanistic studies in breast cancer cells, osteoclasts and osteoblasts revealed that IKKε inhibition reduces the ability of breast cancer cells to grow, move and enhance osteoclastogenesis by engaging both IRF and NFκB signalling pathways. Thus, therapeutic targeting of the IKKε/TBK1 axis may be of value in the treatment of advanced triple negative breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "LncRNAs have been proven to play crucial roles in various processes of breast cancer. LncRNA FGF13-AS1 has been identified as one of the 25 downregulated lncRNAs in breast cancer through analyzing data from two cohorts and TCGA by another group of our lab. In this study, we report that FGF13-AS1 expression is decreased in breast cancer tissue compared with corresponding normal tissue, and the downregulation of FGF13-AS1 is associated with poor prognosis. Functional studies show that FGF13-AS1 inhibits breast cancer cells proliferation, migration, and invasion by impairing glycolysis and stemness properties. Mechanistically, FGF13-AS1 reduces the half-life of c-Myc (Myc) mRNA by binding RNA-binding proteins, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding proteins (IGF2BPs) and disrupting the interaction between IGF2BPs and Myc mRNA. Furthermore, Myc transcriptionally inhibits FGF13-AS1, forming a feedback loop in this signaling pathway. These results reveal for the first time that FGF13-AS1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting glycolysis and stemness properties of breast cancer cells, and the FGF13-AS1/IGF2BPs/Myc feedback loop could be a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer patients. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "DNA hypermethylation is a driving force in carcinogenesis. However, the role of active DNA hypomethylation in cancer remains largely unknown. This process, facilitated by ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1), which oxidizes 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), has never been studied in cervical cancer. Here, we found that TET1 and 5hmC correlative increases from normal cervix to Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), maximizing in High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and decreasing in invasive cancer. Full-length HPV-immortalized HSIL cells demonstrated higher TET1/5hmC levels, and stemness properties, compared to invasive cancer cells. TET1 silencing promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), to transform precancerous cells in vivo. TET1 increased 5hmC in the ZEB1 and VIM promoters, surprisingly, silencing both genes. TET1 interaction with the histone modifiers, LSD1 and EZH2, on the ZEB1 promoter, resulted in gene silencing, via loss of histone H3K4 trimethylation, and gain of histone H3K27 trimethylation. Taken together, TET1 promotes stemness properties, and inhibits EMT, in HSIL cells, through 5hmC-dependent and -independent mechanisms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer stem cells, also known as tumor-initiating cells (TICs), are a population of aggressive and self-renewing cells that are responsible for the initiation and progression of many cancers, including colorectal carcinoma. Intratumoral hypoxia, i.e. reduced oxygen supply following uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, is thought to support TIC activity by inducing specific hypoxia-responsive mechanisms that are not yet entirely understood. Using previously established and fully characterized patient-derived TIC cultures, we could observe increased sphere and colony formation under hypoxic conditions. Mechanistically, microRNA (miRNA)-profiling experiments allowed us to identify miR-215 as one of the main hypoxia-induced miRNAs in primary colon TICs. Through stable overexpression of miR-215, followed by a set of functional in vitro and in vivo investigations, miR-215 was pinpointed as a negative feedback regulator, working against the TIC-promoting effects of hypoxia. Furthermore, we could single out LGR5, a bona fide marker of non-neoplastic intestinal stem cells, as a downstream target of hypoxia/miR-215 signaling. The strong tumor- and TIC-suppressor potential of miR-215 and the regulatory role of the hypoxia/miR-215/LGR5 axis may thus represent interesting points of attack for the development of innovative anti-CSC therapy approaches. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "PD-L1 is critical for tumor cell escape from immune surveillance by inhibiting T cell function via the PD-1 receptor. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies might potently enhance antitumor effects in various tumors, but the effect of PD-L1 on colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains unclear. We observed high PD-L1 expression in CD133 + CD44 + colorectal CSCs and CSC-enriched tumorspheres. Altering PD-L1 expression promoted colorectal CSC self-renewal by increasing the expression of stemness genes, the CD133 + CD44 + cell population sizes and the ability to form tumorspheres. Additionally, PD-L1 expression was markedly increased in chemoresistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, PD-L1 enhanced CRC cell tumorigenicity in nude mice; the inoculation of 1 × 10 4 cells resulted in high tumor formation efficiency. Mechanistically, PD-L1 directly interacted with HMGA1, and HMGA1 upregulation by PD-L1 activated HMGA1-dependent pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, and promoted CSC expansion. HMGA1 downregulation rescued the PD-L1-induced phenotypes, highlighting the role of HMGA1 in PD-L1-mediated colorectal CSC self-renewal. Moreover, PD-L1 expression was correlated with the expression of CSC markers and HMGA1 in clinical CRC specimens. Thus, PD-L1 could crucially contribute to the maintenance of CSC self-renewal by activating HMGA1-dependent signaling pathways. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Piperlongumine (PL), naturally synthesized in long pepper, is known to selectively kill tumor cells via perturbation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. ROS are the primary effector molecules of radiation, and increase of ROS production by pharmacological modulation is known to enhance radioresponse. We therefore investigated the radiosensitizing effect of PL in colorectal cancer cells (CT26 and DLD-1) and CT26 tumor-bearing mice. Firstly, we found that PL induced excessive production of ROS due to depletion of glutathione and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase. Secondly, PL enhanced both the intrinsic and hypoxic radiosensitivity of tumor cells, linked to ROS-mediated increase of DNA damage, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cellular respiration. Finally, the radiosensitizing effect of PL was verified in vivo. PL improved the tumor response to both single and fractionated radiation, resulting in a significant increase of survival rate of tumor-bearing mice, while it was ineffective on its own. In line with in vitro findings, enhanced radioresponse is associated with inhibition of antioxidant systems. In conclusion, our results suggest that PL could be a potential radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a key regulator in innate immunity and has emerged as a promising drug target in cancer treatment, but the utility of this pathway in therapeutic development is complicated by its dichotomous roles in tumor development and immunity. The activation of the STING pathway and the induced antitumor immunity could be attenuated by the feedback activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Here we reported that STAT3 inhibition significantly enhanced the intensity and duration of STING signaling induced by the STING agonist c-diAM(PS) 2 . Such sensitization effect of STAT3 inhibition on STING signaling depended on STING rather than cGAS, which was mediated by simultaneously upregulating the positive modulators and downregulating the negative modulators of the STING pathway. Furthermore, the combination treatment with the STAT3 inhibitor and STING agonist markedly regressed tumor growth in syngeneic mice by increasing CD8 + T cells and reducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment. Our work provides a rationale for the combination of STAT3 inhibitors and STING agonists in cancer immunotherapy. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the prevalence of TIL subpopulations, TLS, PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumors from TNBC patients harboring wild-type or mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline genes. This TNBC cohort included 85% TIL-positive (≥10%) tumors with 21% classified as TIL hi (≥50%). Interestingly, the BRCA mut group had a significantly higher incidence of TIL pos tumors compared to the BRCA wt group (P = 0.037). T cells were dominant in the infiltrate but no statistically significant differences were detected between BRCA wt and BRCA mut for CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T cells or CD20 + B cells. TLS were detected in 74% of tumors but again no significant differences between the BRCA groups. PD-1 expression was observed in 33% and PD-L1 in 53% (any cell, cut-off ≥1%) tumors for the entire TNBC cohort. PD-1 expression correlated with PD-L1 and both with TIL and TLS but was not associated with BRCA mutational status. Our analyses reveal that BRCA wt and BRCA mut TNBC are similar except for a significant increase of TIL pos tumors in the BRCA mut group. While BRCA gene mutations may not directly drive immune infiltration, the greater number of TIL pos tumors could signal greater immunogenicity in this group. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated as novel drivers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying mechanisms of this relationship with hepatocarcinogenesis are unknown. We report a novel, liver-specific lncRNA LINC01093 that shows significant downregulation in HCC tissues. LINC01093 expression is inversely correlated with cancer embolus and HCC TNM stage and as a prognostic predictor for HCC patients. LINC01093 overexpression significantly suppresses HCC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, its knockdown promotes HCC progression. Mechanistic analyses indicate that LINC01093 directly binds insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA–binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), interfering with interaction between IGF2BP1 and glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) mRNA. The result is degradation of GLI1 mRNA, further affecting expression of GLI1 downstream molecules involved in HCC progression. The liver-enriched lncRNA LINC01093 is a promising prognostic indicator for HCC patients, and the newly identified LINC01093–IGF2BP1–GLI1 axis shows potential for therapeutic targets in HCC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers. In this study, a prostate cancer-specific aptamer, Wy5a, was conjugated to polyethylenimine (PEI) with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker for prostate cancer-specific gene delivery. PEI-PEG-AS1411 was synthesized as a non-specific control. PEI-PEG-Wy5a formed complexes with plasmid DNA in a spherical form with a diameter of 70 nm and a positive surface-charge. In transfection assays, PEI-PEG-Wy5a had higher gene delivery efficiency to PC-3 prostate cancer cells than did PEI-PEG or PEI-PEG-AS1411, but not in other types of cells. The results suggest that PEI-PEG-Wy5a may be useful for prostate cancer-specific gene delivery. © 2019 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",

    "Abstract": "The knowledge of cancer cell response to conventional therapies is crucial in order to choose the correct therapy of patients affected by cancer. The major problem is generally attributed to the lack of specific biological processes able to predict the therapy efficacy. Here, we optimized a computational method for the analysis of gene networks able to detect and quantify the effects of a drug in a pan-cancer study. Overall, our method, using several network topological measures has identified a cancer gene network with a key role in biological processes. The gene network, able to classify with a good performance cancer vs normal samples, was modulated in silico to evaluate the effects of new or approved drugs. This computational model could offer an interesting hint to decipher molecular mechanisms contributing to resistance or inefficacy of drugs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Metadherin (MTDH) is an oncogene that has been overexpressed in numerous types of malignancies including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, few investigations associated with the biological behavior of MTDH in CRC have been performed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of modification of MTDH gene expression (knockdown and overexpression) on the biological behavior of CRC in vitro. Methods: MTDH gene expression was analyzed in two CRC cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT116) by qPCR. MTDH was down-regulated via siRNA-mediated knockdown of human MTDH in HCT116 cells, which express high endogenous levels of MTDH gene. Also, MTDH gene was up-regulated via transfection of Caco-2 cells, which express low endogenous levels of MTDH gene, with a plasmid carrying human MTDH gene. Results: Knockdown of MTDH gene expression significantly decreased the gene expression of multidrug resistance gene (MDR1), Snail and NF-κB p65, but increased the gene expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, MTDH-knockdown significantly decreased anaerobic glycolysis (glucose consumption and lactate production), cell proliferation ability and transformation into cancer stem cell. Moreover, up-regulation of MTDH gene significantly increased the gene expression of MDR1, Snail and NF-κB p65, deceased the gene expression of E-cadherin, enhanced cell proliferation, and anaerobic glycolysis and activated transformation into cancer stem cells. Conclusions: MTDH has an important role in promoting CRC aggravation. Also, inhibition of MTDH expression may attenuate the carcinogenic behavior of CRC cells. Furthermore, MTDH-associated NF-κB p65 signaling pathways may be involved in mediating the biological behavior of CRC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world, with characteristics of high morbidity and mortality. Identifying clinically practical targets and uncovering the potential mechanism for HCC were urgent for us. Though aberrantly expressed miR-99b-3p has been reported in several cancers, the expression and roles of miR-99b-3p in HCC remain uncovered. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that miR-99b-3p was overexpressed in HCC by our findings and data from GEO datasets. Statistical analysis revealed that highly expressed miR-99b-3p was closely related to malignant clinicopathological characteristics and poorer prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, results from Wound healing assay, Transwell assays, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)assay and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay revealed that miR-99b-3p played a promoting role in migration, invasion and proliferation of HCC cells. Then, by bioinformatics tools, luciferase reporter gene assay, integrative database analysis, and Pearson correlation analysis and so on, protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) was identified as the target of miR-99b-3p in HCC cells. Furthermore, rescue experiments were conducted to confirm the mediator role of PCDH19 for miR-99b-3p. Collectively, we demonstrate that miR-99b-3p promotes HCC metastasis and proliferation by directly targeting PCDH19. MiR-99b-3p may become a potential therapy target for HCC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins have been shown to be abnormally expressed in different cancers. To investigate the expression pattern of TET proteins in HepG2 cells, sodium ascorbate was used to treat HepG2 cells. Our results showed that TET1, TET2 and TET3 expression was increased after sodium ascorbate treatment. The TET proteins catalyze the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), thus, 5mC and 5hmC levels were examined. The results suggested that 5hmC was increased after sodium ascorbate treatment. To further determine the biological function of the TET proteins, si-TET1, si-TET2 and si-TET3 were transfected into HepG2 cells. The results showed that a knock down of TET3 expression stimulated cell proliferation of HepG2 cells. To further understand the effects of TET3 expression on cell proliferation, sodium ascorbate was added to the cells after transfection with si-TET3. The results demonstrated that sodium ascorbate could rescue TET3 expression and inhibit cell proliferation. Taken together, these results indicate that TET3 expression regulated cell proliferation, which is associated with 5hmC in HepG2 cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Pluronic ® triblock copolymers, which spontaneously form nano-sized aggregates in water, have been considered as promising carriers for bioimaging and drug delivery. However, their use for applications in pharmacology and diagnostics is hindered by instability of polymer aggregates which are easily dissociated into unimers. Here we report a general method for stabilizing Pluronic ® F127 micelles via semi-interpenetrating network (sIPN). The formation of sIPN within a core stabilizes the micelle upon temperature and concentration changes. We determined optimized methods for the preparation of F127 sIPN in the regime of chemical components. Importantly, F127 sIPNs are able to load various organic fluorescence probes, covering a panchromatic range of photoluminescence (350–850 nm; entire UV–Vis-NIR), without compromising their photophysical properties. Moreover, efficient cellular uptake of the fluorescence probes loaded sIPN is observed in human and mouse cells. After intravenous injection into mice, an infrared dye-loaded sIPNs are incorporated in multiple organs and have longer lifetime than a commercially available imaging probe. With the improvement of stability, Pluronic micelles with sIPN can be a powerful tool for building functional nanoprobes and in vivo fluorescence imaging for cancer cells and live animals. © 2019 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one type of the most common malignancies. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the development of HCC remain unknown. To identify the candidate genes in the progression of HCC, gene expression profiles GSE14520, GSE54236, GSE57957 and GSE64041 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). A total of 405 tumor and 399 para-carcinoma samples from patients with HCC were examined to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by function enrichment analyses including Gene Ontology (GO) functions and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. A total of 78 DEGs were screened, including 62 downregulated genes and 16 upregulated genes. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database. The module analysis and Hub genes validation were performed using Cytoscape software. Hierarchical clustering of hub genes was evaluated using UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser. Survival analyses of Hub genes were performed using Kaplan Meier Plotter database. Genes specifically expressed in the liver were analyzed using GENEVESTIGATOR database. CYP2C8 was identified as one of the most promising molecules among all the candidate genes. The expression profile of CYP2C8 in HCC was analyzed using ONCOMINE and UALCAN database. The expression levels of CYP2C8 in HCC samples and hepatoma cells were verified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry analysis. In summary, DEGs and hub genes were identified in the present study, which provides novel insight on the development of HCC. CYP2C8 was downregulated in HCC and could be a potential prognostic biomarker. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: We analysed multiple microarray datasets in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets for messenger RNAs (mRNAs) whose expression is apparently increased in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) samples, compared with that in the adjacent normal biliary epithelial tissue. The results revealed that the expression of tripartite motif-containing 59 (TRIM59) was significantly increased in the CCA tissue samples. TRIM59 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, which contains a highly conserved N-terminal—an interesting new gene (RING) domain regulating transcriptional factors and tumorigenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of TRIM59 expression on tumour growth in CCA. Materials and methods: After analyzing the microarray datasets from the TCGA database and GEO DataSets, we screened out 291 target genes, which are significantly overexpressed in CCA tissues, and TRIM59 was one of them. The quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the expression of TRIM59 in CCA tissues (n = 65) and cell lines. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was conducted to assess the prognosis of TRIM59 in patients with CCA. A specific siRNA (siRNA-1008) was used to inhibit the expression of TRIM59 in HCCC9810 and HUCCT1 cell lines. The effects of TRIM59 silencing on cell proliferation were assessed by the CCK-8, colony-formation, and EDU incorporation assays. Furthermore, the effects of TRIM59 knockdown on cell apoptosis and cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. The in vivo effects were evaluated using a mouse tumorigenic model. Western blotting was also performed to verify the relationship between knockdown of TRIM59 and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Results: TRIM59 was highly expressed in CCA tissues. The knockdown of TRIM59 obviously reduced the proliferation and colony formation abilities of CCA cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the cell apoptosis analysis results showed that TRIM59 silencing apparently promoted CCA cell apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. Our preliminary results indicate that the down-regulation of TRIM59 levels might restrict the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway. Conclusions: Our study revealed that TRIM59 is up-regulated in CCA tissues and cell lines and promoted CCA cell proliferation, possibly by affecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Mistletoe has been used since ancient times in Europe mostly for medicinal purposes. Since 1917, mistletoe preparations have been applied in cancer therapy and today are the most frequently used complementary medicine in tumor treatment. The main cytotoxic constituents of Viscum album are lectins and viscotoxins. Aim of the study: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antiproliferative potential of Viscum album preparations from different host trees and to assess the impact of mistletoe lectin 1 (ML-1) and viscotoxin A (VT-A) in comparison to a structurally similar lectin and thionin. Materials and methods: By means of widely accepted 2D Alamar Blue Assay, based on population counting of living cells using a fluorescent cell viability dye, the potential impact to inhibit tumor cell of the mistletoe preparations (Iscucin ® ) and their single compounds (ML-1 and VT-A) on the cell growth of six human cancer cell lines were evaluated. Also the mixture of ML-1 and VT-A corresponding to the contents in the specific mistletoe preparations were monitored. Ricin and purothionin were used as reference lectin and reference thionin, respectively. Results: The lung carcinoma cell line HCC827 was very sensitive to the Iscucin ® preparations. Very strong antiproliferative effects were found with Iscucin ® Salicis and Tiliae and a strong with Iscucin ® Crataegi, Mali and Populi. The IC 50 concentrations of the Iscucin ® preparations correlated with their respective ML-1 contents, but the ML-1 levels were much lower than the IC 50 concentration of isolated ML-1 (1 ng/ml – 56 ng/ml). ML-1 was much more effective than ricin. Iscucin ® preparations, ML-1 and ricin showed antiproliferative activity on human tumor cells. VT-A and purothionin had no effect on cell viability in the concentration ranges tested. Conclusion: The complete mistletoe extract is more potent to inhibit tumor cell proliferation than isolated ML-1 at an equivalent concentration level. Phenolic compounds found in all Iscucin ® preparations might contribute to uphold the cytotoxic activity of ML-1 by antioxidative action. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of VT-A and possible synergistic actions to the antiproliferative effect of aqueous mistletoe extracts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Oncogenes can potentially cause uncontrolled cell growth, leading to cancer development, and these genes are normally mutated and over-expressed in tumor cells. Genomic alteration of oncogenes might result in oncogenesis and promotion of cancer progression. To date, researchers have focused mainly on the roles of oncogenes in particular cancers, but investigation of oncogenes with gain-of-function mutations in multiple cancer types are less represented in the literature. Furthermore, the effect of those gain-of-function are not validated in gene expression level. To meet this demand, we performed a systematic analysis of gene expression in oncogenes to identify the occurrence of gain-of-function mutations in pan-cancer. We identified 33,551 oncogenic mutations in 5000 samples. From our analysis, we identified three tissues with the highest frequency of gain-of-functional oncogenic mutations in hundreds of samples: breast (739 samples), central nervous system (646 samples) and large intestine (498 samples). By further counting the number of occurrences of oncogenes across cancer types, we identified a list cross-cancer mutational signatures of 99 oncogenes highly mutated in >400 samples in breast, central nervous system and large intestine samples. By further overlapping with gene expression data in the matched tumor samples, we further identified 1875 gain-of-functional mutations/events with consistent gene up-regulation in 1031 samples from multiple cancers. This result may offer additional insight into the relationship between gene dosage and oncogenesis and maybe useful in targeted cancer therapy. In summary, this study provides the first globally examining on the genetic alteration of oncogenes across cancer types. Clinical association analysis has shown that these 99 genes have a significant effect on survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate the impact of miR-451 on the biological behaviours of colon cancer cells along with its targets interactions. Method: The levels of miR-451 were tested in colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW48). Multiple functional and immunological assays were performed to analyse miR-451 induced growth changes in-vitro and downstream effects on target proteins. Results: Overexpression of miR-451 in colon cancer cells led to reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and decrease accumulation of the cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, a significant increase in the number of the cells was noted in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. Moreover, miR-451 reduced the expression of Oct-4, Sox-2 and Snail indicating its role in stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation. An inverse correlation between miR-451 and macrophage migration inhibitory protein (MIF) protein expression occurred in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, restoration the level of miR-451 in colon cancer cells inhibits tumour spheres formation. Conclusion: miR-451 has tumour suppressor effects in vitro, which can inhibit the cancer-related signalling pathways in colon cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The microRNAs (miRNAs) have been validated as prognostic markers in many cancers. The aim of this study was to identify new miRNA prognostic biomarkers in endometrial cancer (EC) and to develop an expression-based miRNA signature to provide survival risk prediction for EC patients. Methods: From TCGA database, the miRNA datasets of EC and clinical information were downloaded in April 2018. Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identify prognostic factors. Using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assess the sensitivity and specificity of prognostic model. Results: 530 patients were randomly divided into training set and testing set. Among 561 differentially expressed miRNAs, 4 miRNAs (miR-4758, miR-876, miR-142, miR-190b) were demonstrated to be predictive biomarkers of overall survival (OS) for EC patients in training set. Based on the risk score of 4-miRNA model, patients in the training set were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different OS. This 4-miRNA model was validated in testing and entire set. The AUC for the ROC curves in the entire set was 0.704. Meanwhile, multivariate Cox regression combined with other traditional clinical parameters indicated that the 4-miRNA model can be used as an independent OS prognostic factor. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these miRNAs are involved in biological processes and pathways that are closely related to cancer. Conclusion: A robust 4-miRNA signature as an independent prognostic factor for OS in EC patients was established. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Curcumin (CUR) is a natural active ingredient that attracted much attention for its chemotherapeutic activity against tumors without causing toxicity in healthy cells. However, it has certain limitations for being used in chemotherapy such as low aqueous solubility and hydrolytic instability in the physiological environment. In this study, self-assembled poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-grafted gelatin (Gel-mPEG) nanogels were fabricated as delivery systems to improve the applicability of CUR in cancer treatment. CUR-loaded Gel-mPEG nanogels exhibited desired size range, relatively colloidal stability, and provided enhanced CUR stability in aqueous solutions. Especially, they showed significant high CUR loading capacity and better anticancer activity than free CUR as compared to previously reported CUR-loaded nanogels according to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the in vitro release of CUR from the nanogels was controlled and prolonged up to 96 h. These results demonstrated that Gel-mPEG nanogels are the promising modality for the efficient delivery of CUR in cancer treatment. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

    "Abstract": "In the present study, NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 and/or Hsp-27 inhibitor KRIBB-3 agents were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating androgen receptor expression on prostate cancer cell lines. The decrease observed in androgen receptor and p65 expressions, particularly at 48 h, in parallel with the decrease in the phosphorylation of the p-IKK α/β and p-Hsp-27 proteins in the LNCaP cells, indicated that androgen receptor inactivation occurred after the inhibition of the NF-κB and Hsp-27. In 22Rv1 cells, androgen receptor variant-7 was also observed to be decreased in the combined dose of 48 h. The association of this decrease with the decrease in androgen receptor and p65 expressions is a supportive result for the role of NF-κB signaling in the formation of androgen receptor variant. In androgen receptor variant-7 siRNA treatment in 22Rv1 cell lines, decrease of expression of androgen receptor variant-7 as well as decrease of expression of androgen receptor and p65 were observed. The decrease statistically significant in androgen receptor and p65 expressions was even greater when siRNA treatment was followed with low dose and time (6 h) combined treatment after transfection. We also showed that increased Noxa and decreased Bcl-2 protein level, indicated that apoptotic induction after this combination. In conclusion, inhibition of NF-κB and Hsp-27 is also important, along with therapies for androgen receptor variant-7 inhibition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The pathogenesis and the underlying mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. LncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is an oncogene in a variety of cancers. The role of PVT1 in HCC progression is not completely understood. In the present study, we conducted a series of studies to explore the role of PVT1 on autophagy in HCC cells. Our study found PVT1 levels were markedly up-regulated in the corresponding HCC tissues. Importantly, we found that PVT1 could facilitate cell autophagy in HCC cells. Then, we confirmed that the effect of PVT1 promoting autophagy was dependent on regulating ATG3 expression. Further investigations revealed that PVT1 could upregulate autophagy-related gene 3 (ATG3) expression by acting as an endogenous sponge of miR-365, which was an inhibitor gene on ATG3 protein by targeting 3′UTR of ATG3 mRNA. Moreover, rescue assays indicated that the effect of PVT1 on autophagy of HCC cells were dependent on miR-365. In conclusion, our study demonstrated PVT1 might be a key regulator participating in autophagy in HCC cells. We proved that PVT1 could promote autophagy as ceRNA by targeting miR-365. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this article, an improved synthesis strategy of the potent anticancer compound 4,7-dichloro-2-quinolinemethanol (QM) and its acrylate ester 4,7-dichloro-2-quinolinemethylacrylate (AQM) are described. AQM is copolymerized using free-radical polymerization with N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (VP) and the copolymers obtained from different molar ratios of monomers are subjected to nanoprecipitation to produce suspensions of nanoparticles (NPs) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The smallest and stable NPs are prepared with the AQM-VP copolymers 45:55 and 40:60 (118.9 and 128.7 nm in diameter, respectively) at 1 mg mL −1 , and along with AQM and QM, are evaluated for their cytotoxic activity on MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cells using MTT bioassay. AQM and QM are highly cytotoxic (IC 50 : 19 and 41 μM, respectively); however, the NPs are not cytotoxic in the range of the assayed concentrations. These results contribute to the search for new polymeric NPs with potential application as QM delivery systems for the treatment of cancer or other diseases treatable with QM. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "Abstract": "With the advancements of geospatial technologies, geospatial datasets of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and mortality statistics are increasingly used to examine the health effects of PM 2.5 . Choices of these datasets with difference geographic characteristics (e.g., accuracy, scales, and variations) in disease burden studies can significantly impact the results. The objective of this study is to revisit the estimations of PM 2.5 -attributable mortality by taking advantage of recent advancements in high resolution mapping of PM 2.5 concentrations and fine scale of mortality statistics and to explore the impacts of new data sources, geographic scales, and spatial variations of input datasets on mortality estimations. We estimate the PM 2.5 -mortality for the years of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 using three PM 2.5 concentration datasets [Chemical Transport Model (CTM), random forests-based regression kriging (RFRK), and geographically weighted regression (GWR)] at two resolutions (i.e., 10 km and 1 km) and mortality rates at two geographic scales (i.e., regional-level and county-level). The results show that the estimated PM 2.5 -mortality from the 10 km CTM-derived PM 2.5 dataset tend to be smaller than the estimations from the 1 km RFRK- and GWR-derived PM 2.5 datasets. The estimated PM 2.5 -mortalities from regional-level mortality rates are similar to the estimations from those at county level, while large deviations exist when zoomed into small geographic regions (e.g., county). In a scenario analysis to explore the possible benefits of PM 2.5 concentrations reduction, the uses of the two newly developed 1 km resolution PM 2.5 datasets (RFRK and GWR) lead to discrepant results. Furthermore, we found that the change in PM 2.5 concentration is the primary factor that leads to the PM 2.5 -attributable mortality decrease from 2000 to 2015. The above results highlight the impact of the adoption of input datasets from new sources with varied geographic characteristics on the PM 2.5 -attributable mortality estimations and demonstrate the necessity to account for these impact in future disease burden studies. Capsule: We revisited the estimations of PM 2.5 -attributable mortality with advancements in PM 2.5 mapping and mortality statistics, and demonstrated the impact of geographic characteristics of geospatial datasets on mortality estimations. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "It is well known that children treated for cancer are at risk for cognitive and functional impairments. Such research is largely based on studies of late effects in school-aged or older children. However, far less is known about executive function weaknesses in preschool-aged children treated for cancer. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine executive functioning in a clinically referred sample of young oncology patients, and its association with broader domains of functioning. Data from 61 young children with cancer, who were referred for clinical cognitive evaluations, were abstracted and included in this study. Patients were 5.00 years of age (SD = 0.72) at assessment, 54.1% male, and two-thirds (63.9%) had been treated for brain tumors. Most executive functions were significantly discrepant from the mean, with 47.5% of preschoolers having parent-reported working memory concerns within the clinically significant range. There were no differences in executive functioning based on diagnosis or treatment status. Parent-reported executive functioning was strongly correlated with global intelligence and adaptive functioning, with some indices also associated with nonverbal problem solving and pre-academic skills. Ultimately, results indicate the presence of emerging weaknesses in executive functioning in young children with cancer, and add to a growing body of literature highlighting the potential cognitive and behavioral risks associated with a cancer diagnosis in early childhood. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "The excellent anticancer effect of combined differential cancer therapies has been observed in the last few decades. Efficient theragnostic nanoparticles (NPs) for malignancy treatment have received considerable research attention and widely investigated today. This study presents our results on the development of aptamer-functionalized Fe 3 O 4 @carbon@doxorubicin NPs (Apt-Fe 3 O 4 @C@DOX) and their application in the synergetic chemo–photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer. The Apt-Fe 3 O 4 @C@DOX NPs displayed high photothermal conversion efficiency and extensive pH/heat-induced drug release. In vitro (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium) bromide experiments indicated that the combined chemo–PTT is much more toxic toward lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) than PTT or chemotherapy alone. In addition, the Apt-Fe 3 O 4 @C@DOX NPs demonstrated decreasing contrast enhancement of magnetic resonance (MR) signals, which means they may be potentially applied as a contrast agent and serve as a critical component of T 2 -weighted MR imaging of tumor tissues. Taking the results together, the Apt-Fe 3 O 4 @C@DOX NPs show great potential for cancer therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We report results of the studies relating to the fabrication of a label-free, flexible, light weight and disposable conducting paper based immunosensing platform comprising of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) and nanostructured iron oxide (nFe 2 O 3 @PEDOT:PSS) nanocomposite for detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a cancer biomarker. The effect of various solvents such as sorbitol, ethanol, propanol, n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the electrical conductivity of Whatman filter paper (WP) modified with nFe 2 O 3 @PEDOT:PSS/WP was investigated. The electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS/WP electrode was found to be enhanced by two orders of magnitude (from 6.8× 10 −4 to 1.92 × 10 −2 Scm −1 ) after its treatment with DMSO. Further, nFe 2 O 3 doped PEDOT:PSS/WP electrode exhibited the electrical conductivity as 2.4 × 10 −2 Scm −1 . Besides this, the incorporation of iron oxide nanoparticles (nFe 2 O 3 ) into PEDOT:PSS/WP resulted in improved electrochemical performance and signal stability. This nFe 2 O 3 @PEDOT:PSS/WP based platform was used for immobilization of the anti-carcinoembronic antigen (anti-CEA) protein for quantitative estimation of cancer biomarker (CEA). The results of electrochemical response studies revealed that this conducting paper based immunoelectrode had a sensitivity of 10.2 μAng −1 mLcm −2 in the physiological range (4–25 ngmL −1 ) and shelf life of 34 days. Further, the proposed immunoelectrode was validated with conventional ELISA for the detection of CEA in serum samples of cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "MiR-515-5p has been suggested to function as tumor suppressor in various human cancers. However, the role of miR-515-5p in prostate cancer was still unclear. In this study, we observed miR-515-5p expression was reduced in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal prostatic tissues and normal human prostate epithelial cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, we found miR-515-5p was negatively correlated with TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer tissue samples, and miR-515-5p directly targeted TRIP13 3′-UTR and negatively regulated TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, miR-515-5p acted as a tumor suppressor to regulate cell proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting TRIP13 in prostate cancer. Besides, we observed that miR-515-5p expression in prostate cancer patients with advanced T stage subgroup or high Gleason score was significantly lower than its expression in prostate cancer patients with early T stage or low Gleason score. Survival analysis suggested that prostate cancer cases with high miR-515-5p expression had better prognosis than prostate cancer cases with low miR-515-5p expression. In conclusion, our study highlights the clinical and biological role of miR-515-5p as tumor suppressive microRNA in prostate cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "We demonstrate high-sensitivity detection of metastatic breast cancer cells using terahertz (THz) chemical microscopy (TCM) with aptamers as ligands. For the aptamers, we use previously developed synthetic single stranded (ss) DNA aptamers mammaglobin B1 (MAMB1) and mammaglobin A2 (MAMA2) that bind to mammaglobin B and mammaglobin A proteins, respectively, which are overexpressed on the surface of MCF7 and MDA-MB-415 breast cancer cells. Each aptamer was immobilized on the surface of a sensing plate, and the amplitude of the THz signal was measured upon the binding of each aptamer to different number (10–10 6 ) of its target breast cancer cells. A change in the THz amplitude was observed when MAMB1 and MAMA2 bind to MCF7 and MDA-MB-415, respectively. We find that this change was linear as a function of the log number of breast cancer cells used. No change in the THz amplitude was observed when the same number of normal breast cells (MCF 10A) were used. Moreover, MAMB1 and MAMA2 did not show binding to the counter breast cancer cells, indicating high selectivity. We have demonstrated that the TCM using aptamers as ligands has a limit of detection as small as 1 breast cancer cell in 100 μL of sample. Results described here indicate that the TCM could be a powerful tool to detect metastatic breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the expression of the lncRNA ZFAS1 in cervical cancer and its relationship with patient prognosis and cervical cancer cell chemosensitivity. Methods: The expression of ZFAS1 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. The cervical cancer CaSki and the HeLa cell lines were transfected to be divided into Blank, siR-Control, and siR-ZFAS1 groups. MTT, wound-healing, and transwell assays were used to evaluate cell biological function. Cisplatin with different concentrations was used to treat cells in different transfection groups, and MTT assays were used to detect the cell growth inhibition rate and the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin was measured. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. A xenograft mouse model was used to investigate the effects of siR-ZFAS1 on the chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Results: ZFAS1 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, and increased ZFAS1 levels led to poor prognoses in patients. In addition, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group showed remarkably reduced ZFAS1 expression as well as cell proliferation, invasion and migration. After being treated with cisplatin at different concentrations, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group had dramatically increased cell growth inhibition and apoptosis but lower cisplatin IC50s. In addition, siR-ZFAS1 reduced the volumes and weights of tumors in nude mice treated with cisplatin and enhanced the chemosensitivity of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin. Conclusion: The lncRNA ZFAS1 was upregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and its high expression indicated a poor prognosis. Silencing ZFAS1 may inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion and enhance cisplatin chemosensitivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Chemo-photothermal combination therapy is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In this study, to achieve the combined photothermal-chemotherapy of breast cancer, a pH-sensitive oxidized hyaluronic acid-decorated dihydroxyphenyl/hydrazide bifunctionalized hydroxyethyl chitosan (DHHC)-gold nanorod (GNR) conjugate was developed. DHHC was synthesized by successive dihydroxyphenylation and hydrazidation of hydroxyethyl chitosan through carbodiimide reaction and click chemistry, respectively. The conjugate was obtained by chemically bonding DHHC onto GNR via Au-catechol bonds. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto the conjugate via an acid-labile hydrazone linkage with a drug loading content of 5.1%. DOX-loaded conjugate displayed good stability in neutral aqueous solutions and exhibited pH-responsive drug release and surface charge reversal behaviors. In vitro biological studies indicated that the conjugate could be effectively internalized by breast cancer MCF-7 cells and synergistic therapeutic effects were demonstrated, suggesting its great potential in combined photothermal-chemotherapy of breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objective: As one broader class of non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), non-coding antisense (AS) transcripts are functionally characterized to play pivotal roles in various pathophysiological processes, including tumor biology. Methods: In this study, the exact biological functions and regulation mechanisms of GAS6-AS1 in gastric cancer (GC) was examined. Results: The expression of GAS6-AS1 was markedly upregulated in GC tissues and is associated with advanced stage (III + IV) of GC patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that GAS6-AS1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion ability in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo by promoting entry into S-phase. The mechanistic investigations showed that GAS6-AS1 can control the expression of its cognate sense gene GAS6 at the transcriptional or translational levels by forming a RNA-RNA duplex, consequently inducing an increase of AXL level and driveling AXL signaling pathway activation. Conclusions: Taken together, our studies indicate that GAS6-AS1 significantly driving the aggressive phenotype in GC through activating its cognate sense gene GAS6, and provides a more complete understanding of GAS6-AS1 as a potential therapeutic target for GC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Proteins play an essential role in the biological processes associated with cancer. Their altered expression levels can deregulate critical cellular pathways and interactive networks. In this study, the mass spectrometry-based label-free quantification followed by functional annotation was performed to investigate the most significant deregulated proteins among tissues of primary breast tumor (PT) and axillary metastatic lymph node (LN) and corresponding non-tumor tissues contralateral (NCT) and adjacent (ANT) from patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. A total of 462 proteins was observed as differentially expressed (DEPs) among the groups analyzed. A high level of similarity was observed in the proteome profile of both non-tumor breast tissues and DEPs (n = 12) were mainly predicted in the RNA metabolism. The DEPs among the malignant and non-tumor breast tissues [n = 396 (PTxNCT) and n = 410 (LNxNCT)] were related to pathways of the LXR/RXR, NO, eNOS, eIF2 and sirtuins, tumor-related functions, fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress. Remarkable similarity was observed between both malignant tissues, which the DEPs were related to metastatic capabilities. Altogether, our findings revealed differential proteomic profiles that affected cancer associated and interconnected signaling processes. Validation studies are recommended to demonstrate the potential of individual proteins and/or pathways as biological markers in breast cancer. Significance: The proteomic analysis of this study revealed high similarity in the proteomic profile of the contralateral and adjacent non-tumor breast tissues. Significant differences were identified among the proteome of the malignant and non-tumor tissue groups of the same patients, providing relevant insights into the hallmarks, signaling pathways, biological functions, and interactive protein networks that act during tumorigenesis and breast cancer progression. These proteins are suggested as targets of relevant interest to be explored as potential biological markers related to tumor development and metastatic progression in the breast cancer disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Dioxins (PCDDs), furans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) emitted into the environment can accumulate in foods and become a significant source of dietary exposure for consumers of these compounds. This study aims to assess the dietary exposure of the residents in a rural area of the Silesia region in southern Poland to PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs. The goal is to estimate cancer and non-cancer health risks due to the consumption of foods of animal origin. The area has relatively higher concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in the air in comparison to large industrialized cities of the Silesia province. Three popular foods of animal origin, namely free-range chicken meat, free-range chicken eggs, and cow milk produced in the farms were used. The control samples were the same foods from the local grocery stores. Two exposure scenarios were considered: Firstly that residents consumed free-range foods and secondly that the food items were purchased from stores in the study area. In the first scenario, exposure to concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) yielded evidence of elevated cancer and non-cancer risks. The hazard quotient (HQ) was 71.3 for non-cancer risk and 7.5 × 10 −3 for cancer risk. The health risk from exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs in the second scenario was 6.9 × 10 −4 and HQ = 0.8, respectively. Implementation of educational activities in the study area is needed to increase the resident's awareness of the risks associated with the emissions of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants to the environment, including aspects such as the main sources of the emission and how to avoid exposure to these compounds. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Polyphyllin VI (PP-VI) is one of the major saponins present in Paris polyphylla Sm., a medicinal plant primarily used for cancer treatment in China and India. However, its anti-metastatic activity remains largely unknown. The current study thus investigated the anti-metastatic activity of PP-VI in mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 and human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The anti-metastatic effect of PP-VI was investigated at a sub-cytotoxic dose in migration and invasion assays in vitro. Experimental metastasis mouse model was used to examine the anti-metastatic effect of PP-VI in vivo. Additionally, target prediction, real-time PCR, Western blotting and luciferase assay were performed to identify the target gene of a pro-metastatic microRNA, miR-18a in 4T1 cells. The effect of PP-VI on the identified target of miR-18a was further investigated. The results showed that PP-VI impaired the viability of 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, when applied at a sub-cytotoxic dose, PP-VI suppressed the metastatic potential of 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Receptor expressed in lymphoid tissue (RELT)-like 2 (Rell2) was identified as a direct target of miR-18a with anti-metastatic functions in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. PP-VI treatment resulted in increased expression of Rell2 and decreased level of miR-18a in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. PP-VI treatment also attenuated miR-18a mimic or Rell2 siRNA-augmented migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. The current work thus demonstrates for the first time that targeted regulation of Rell2 by miR-18a is in part implicated in the anti-metastatic effect of PP-VI in breast cancer cells, providing novel pharmacological insights into the anti-cancer effect of PP-VI. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Anterior gradient protein 2 homolog (AGR) is a potential tumor biomarker and plays an important role in tissue development and regeneration. The intracellular detection of AGR is rarely reported. By conjugating the AGR aptamer with a cytosine base sequence as Ag cluster template, a highly fluorescent probe (MA@AgNCs) was synthesized for targeting intracellular AGR. The MA@AgNCs display a maximum fluorescence peak at 565 nm, and possess an excellent quantum yield (QY = 87.43%), small size, great biocompatibility, low toxicity, and good stability. Moreover, the as synthesized MA@AgNCs show high specificity on recognizing breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Triptolide, the component of traditional Chinese herb, has been used as an inflammatory medicine and reported to be anti-tumor for various cancers recently. However, the effect of triptolide on Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer (ESCC) has not yet been elucidated. In the study, we found that triptolide significantly inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, migration and survivability of ESCC cells. Moreover, we observed that triptolide induced ESCC cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase and apoptosis through cyclin D1-CDK4/6 regulation and caspases activation. In addition, we revealed that triptolide regulates cell apoptosis and metastasis by p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway, respectively. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effect of triptolide on ESCC was validated in mouse xenograft model. So, we propose that triptolide may be a candidate drug for ESCC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapy is currently regarded as the most promising treatment to fight against cancer. This is particularly true in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an indolent neoplastic disease of B-lymphocytes which eventually causes the immune system's failure. In this and other areas of cancer research, mathematical modeling is pointed out as a prominent tool to analyze theoretical and practical issues. Its lack in studies of chemoimmunotherapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is what motivated us to come up with a simple ordinary differential equation model. It is based on ideas of de Pillis and Radunskaya and on standard pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics assumptions. In order to check the positivity of the state variables, we first establish an invariant region where these time-dependent variables remain positive. Afterwards, the action of the immune system, as well as the chemoimmunotherapeutic role in promoting cancer cure are investigated by means of numerical simulations and the classical linear stability analysis. The role of adoptive cellular immunotherapy is also addressed. Our overall conclusion is that chemoimmunotherapeutic protocols can be effective in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia provided that chemotherapy is not a limiting factor to the immunotherapy efficacy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In an attempt to find a new class of antimicrobial agents, in the present study we report the synthesis of bipartite hybrid styryl derivatives of quinoxaline containing para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and their biological evaluation as antimicrobial agents. The series of new substituted styryl based derivatives 5(a–k) were evaluated for antimicrobial potential against various bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi; C. albicans, with ampicillin and amphotericin B as standards. Similarly these compounds were also screened for anti-cancer activity using MCF-7 cell line. Among the synthesized compounds, 5(c) was observed to be the most active compound against various strains with MIC in a range of 7.9–31 μM of the series and compound 5i came out with significant anti-cancer activity with IC 50 value of 7 μM. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A 1,6-α-D-glucan (CPA) with a high molecular weight of 2.0 × 10 3 kDa was isolated from the fruits of Castanea mollissima Blume. CPA showed good water solubility, low side effects on normal cells, and moderate cytotoxicity on cancer cells. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) possess significant anticancer effects, but poor water solubility and dispersity. Therefore, an effective nanocomposite was designed in order to enhance the stability and anticancer effects of SeNPs decorated with CPA. Water soluble and dispersed selenium nanoparticles (CPA-SeNPs) were fabricated using CPA and Na 2 SeO 3 by redox reaction with ascorbic acid. The average diameter of CPA-SeNPs was 53.7 ± 4.0 with a Se content of approximately 171.4 mg/g. CPA-SeNPs showed a significant anti-proliferative effect on HeLa cells in vitro. Since these NPs could induce apoptosis and S phase arrest. The apoptotic pathway triggered by CPA-SeNPs on HeLa cells was also characterized as induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3. This study suggested that CPA-SeNPs could be developed as a potential candidate in cancer treatment, especially against human cervical cancer. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in tumor biology. To date, some lncRNAs have been found to be involved in competitive binding of miRNAs, a major group of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), through participation in a regulatory network of protein-coding gene expression. However, the functional roles of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have rarely been reported. Here, we construct a hypothetical ceRNA network by analyzing differential expression of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs obtained from 96 ESCC tissues and 13 normal tissues in the Cancer Genome Atlas. Ultimately, 95 lncRNAs, 9 miRNAs, and 40 mRNAs were identified (fold change >1.5, P < .05) and included in the ceRNA network for ESCC. Moreover, three lncRNAs (IGF2-AS, MUC2 and SOX2-OT) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (log-rank test, P < .05), and further experiments revealed that lncRNA DLX6-AS1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and invasion of esophageal cancer cells by enhancing the endogenous function of mTOR. We believe that the identified ceRNA network can facilitate a better understanding of lncRNA-related mechanisms in ESCC. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Previous study has shown heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1(HNRNPA1) is highly expressed in various human cancers. In order to study the clinical value and potential function of HNRNPA1 in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), three datasets from the GEPIA, GEO and TCGA were analyzed. HNRNPA1 expression was found to be significantly higher in HBV-positive HCC samples, which was supported with IHC validation. Both GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that HNRNPA1 co-expressed genes were involved in translation, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis and assembly, ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, RNA splicing, etc. Survival analysis showed a significant reduction in overall survival of patients with high HNRNPA1 expression from both the GSE14520 cohort and 151 patients with HBV-related HCC cohort. Furthermore, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that HNRNPA1 may regulate HCC progression by influencing the cell cycle and WNT signaling pathway, etc. HNRNPA1 overexpression has diagnostic value in distinguishing between HCC and non-HCC liver tissue (AUC = 0.730). Finally, HNRNPA1 was a directly target gene of miR-22 manifested by the reduced luciferase activity and decreased HNRNPA1 expression in the cells with overexpression of miR-22. HNRNPA1 might function as an oncogene through the EGFR signaling pathway in HBV-related HCC, which has not been reported in previous studies. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets dispersed a supramolecular hydrogel network (GOSHGel) has been achieved. The microstructures of GO dispersed hydrogels are investigated. Our previously reported a benign supramolecular hydrogel (SHGel) was used and mixed with exfoliated monolayers of GO to offer GOSHGel through several interplaying non-covalent type supramolecular interactions. The GOSHGel was employed as the stabilizing agent for the direct sun-ray mediated photo-chemically synthesized ‘Green’ silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). In vitro and in vivo toxicity assessments approve the bio-relevant nature of the GOSHGel capped Ag-NPs. The Ag-NPs were potentially antimicrobial against bacteria, including gram −ve bacterium (Escherichia coli) and gram +ve bacterium (Bacillus subtilis), and fungal pathogen, Pichia guilliermondii. Remarkably, these GOSHGel capped Ag-NPs also showed tremendous anticancer activity tested against human breast cancer cell. Both, GOSHGel and Ag-NPs embedded GOSHGel, were useful as the cell supportive scaffolds. This cell attachment was selective for non-malignant cell i.e. macrophages. Confocal microscopic study revealed the luminescent nature of GOSHGel capped Ag-NPs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A microenvironment-sensitive probe SCD is developed with a thiol-activated functional group, which could identify specific proteins containing free cysteine residues, such as human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and β-lactoglobulin. The probe displays good selectivity and sensitivity toward thiol-containing proteins over other proteins, ions, and amino acids under physiological conditions. Due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer property, SCD exhibits a fluorescence “turn-on” which is utilized for the quantitative detection of trace HSA contents in urine and serum media for the assessment of kidney function and diagnosis of renal diseases. Furthermore, SCD realizes HSA imaging in human breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Funding Text 1": "In summary, a fluorescent probe SCD, immobilized with a thiol-active functional group, was developed for sensing proteins with free cysteine residue ( e.g. HSA), which can be applied to recognize HSA in practical urine and serum samples with excellent selectivity and sensitivity. In addition, SCD could serve as a good candidate for imaging exogenous HSA in living cells. Due to the superior performance, we expect SCD a possible agent for the diagnosis of thiol-containing proteins-related diseases in the future.

    "Abstract": "Malignant melanoma was the leading cause of mortality among the skin-associated cancer owing to its highly metastatic feature, increasing incidence and drug resistance requirement. Retinoids played important roles in the treatment of cancer via the activation of retinoid acid receptor (RAR) or retinoid X receptor (RXR). Our present study showed that the third-generation retinoid adapalene exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the proliferation of melanoma cells than other retinoids, such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), isotretinoin, acitretin and bexarotene, and adapalene exerted significant inhibitory effects on the colony formation of melanoma cells. Further study confirmed that adapalene treatment triggered dramatic S phase arrest and apoptosis, and S phase arrest was the potential mechanism of apoptosis induction. In addition, adapalene treatment dramatically regulated the expression of S phase-related protein, and increased the protein level of DNA damage marker，which were consistent with the results of the induction of the tail moment in comet assays. Meanwhile, DNA damage response was activated and the DNA repair pathway was simultaneously inhibited by adapalene treatment, which might furtherly potentiate S phase arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Taken together, these results showed that adapalene exhibited strong anti-cancer activity, and might be a candidate agent for the clinical treatment of melanoma. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Sarcosine, a potential biomarker for prostate cancer, can be detected in a solid state enzyme based biosensor using sarcosine oxidase, with particle immobilised reagents. A novel fusion protein of the fluorescent protein, mCherry, sarcosine oxidase (SOx), and the polypeptide R5 (R5 2 -mCherry-SOx-R5-6 H), was explored, which allowed self-immobilization on silica microparticles and long-term (90 days +) retention of activity, even at room temperature. In contrast, commercial wildtype SOx lost activity in a few days. A silica-R5 2 -mCherry-SOx-R5-6H microparticle sensor for determination of sarcosine in urine, linked the SOx coproduct, H 2 O 2 , to a measurement catalysed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immobilised on silica, in the presence of Amplex Ultrared (AR) to generate fluorescence at 582 nm. Silica microparticles carrying all the reagents (R5 2 -mCherry-SOx-R5-6H, HRP and AR) were used to produce a silica-microparticle biosensor which responded to sarcosine at micromolar levels. Interference by amino acids and uric acid was examined and it was found that the silica-reagent carrying system could be calibrated in urine and responded across the clinically relevant concentration range. This contrasted with similar assays using commercial SOx, where interference inhibited the sarcosine signal measurement in urine. The microparticle biosensor was tested in urine from healthy volunteers and prostate cancer patients, showing higher concentrations of sarcosine in cancer patients consistent with previous reports of elevated sarcosine levels. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to investigate the biological role of C5orf34 in Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and the mechanism of such role. Methods: The mRNA expression of C5orf34 was analyzed using student's t-test based on the data obtained from TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate the prognosis value of C5orf34. Chi-square (χ 2 ) test was performed to analyze the correlation between C5orf34 expression and clinical features. The effect of C5orf34 siRNA on A549 and SPCA1 cells proliferation and migration were explored using CCK8 assay, wound healing assay and transwell assays, respectively. Western blot was performed to evaluate the expression of C5orf34, ERK, p-ERK, MEK and p-MEK. Results: C5orf34 expression was enhanced in LAD and positively correlated with poor prognosis in patients with LAD. χ 2 test revealed that C5orf34 expression was obviously associated with age (p = 0.016), Pathologic-Stage (p = 0.045) and Pathologic-N (p = 0.023). In addition, knockdown of C5orf34 significantly suppressed A549 and SPCA1 cells proliferation and motility (p &lt; 0.01) in vitro. Moreover, by western blot analysis, we found that depleting C5orf34 remarkably reduced the ratio of p-MEK/MEK and p-ERK/ERK in A549 cells. Conclusion: Our results firstly revealed that C5orf34 might play a facilitating role in LAD development and progression by regulating MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, our data implied that C5orf34 may be a potential predictor and treatment target for LAD. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer diagnosis based on serum biomarkers requires receptors of extreme sensitivity and selectivity. Tunability of aptamer selection makes them ideal for that challenge. However, aptamer characterization is a time-consuming task, not always thoroughly addressed, leading to suboptimal aptamer performance. In this work, we report on the affinity characterization and potential usage of two aptamers against a candidate cancer biomarker, the neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL). Electrochemical sandwich assays on Au electrodes and SPR experiments showed a restricted capture ability of one of the aptamers (LCN2–4) and a small detectability of the other (LCN2-2). Interestingly, a truncated version of the signaling aptamer LCN2-2 selectively binds to NGAL covalently linked to magnetic beads due to high local protein concentration. The functional affinity of this aptamer is enhanced by three-orders of magnitude using rolling circle amplification (RCA), completed in only 15 min, followed by hybridization with short complementary fluorescein-tag probes, enzyme labeling and chronoamperometric measurement. Microscale thermophoresis experiments show a poor affinity for the protein in solution, which urges the importance of a full and in-depth characterization of aptamers to be used as diagnostic reagents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The simultaneous quantitative analysis of intracellular metabolic coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) is of interest because they participate in many electron-transfer reactions of metabolism. But, the simultaneous quantitative analysis of FAD and FMN is hard to be achieved by traditional analytical methods. This paper proposes a novel strategy of intrinsic fluorescence coupled with four-way calibration method for simultaneous quantitative analysis of intracellular metabolic coenzymes FAD and FMN. Through mathematical separation, this proposed analytical method efficiently achieved the simultaneous quantitative analysis of metabolic coenzymes FAD and FMN in the cell, despite the fact that uncalibrated spectral interferents coexist in the system. The predicted concentrations of FAD and FMN in the cell are 217.0 ± 6.9 and 155.0 ± 1.7 pmol/10 6 cells respectively, which were validated by the approved liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. This analytical method with second-order advantage simply requires the cell solution to be diluted by a buffer, it could introduce an interesting analytical strategy for multianalyte direct quantitative analysis in complex biological systems. In addition, we explore the third-order advantage of four-way calibration by a comparative study based on this real fluorescence data. The comparisons indicate that a four-way calibration method can provide higher sensitivity and more resolving power than a three-way calibration method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Adenosine is closely related to the development of cancer, and it can be regarded as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Here, a T7 exonuclease (T7 Exo)-assisted and target-triggered cascade dual recycling signal amplification strategy was developed for the sensitive and specific detection of adenosine. In this strategy, a capture strand (Cap)-inhibit strand (Inh) duplex and a DNA hairpin with intact G-quadruplex sequence are designed. In the presence of adenosine, Cap binds with adenosine specifically to form Cap-adenosine complex with recessed 5′-hydroxyl termini, causing the release of Inh. Under the action of T7 Exo, the adenosine is released from Cap-adenosine complex. Then the released adenosine interacts with the next Cap-Inh duplex to promote the release of a new Inh and the recycle I is completed. After that, the released Inh hybridizes with hairpin to form Inh-hairpin duplex with blunt 5′ -hydroxyl termini. Under the same action of T7 Exo, the Inh gets released and a G-quadruplex sequence is obtained. Subsequently, the released Inh continues opening hairpin and the recycle II is accomplished. Finally, plenty of G-quadruplex sequences are generated and then interact with N-methyl-mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) to obtain enhanced fluorescence signal. The limit of detection (LOD) of the proposed strategy is estimated to be 9.8 × 10 −7 mol L −1 , and the linear range of the strategy is from 5.0 × 10 −6 mol L −1 to 7.0 × 10 −4 mol L −1 . Besides, the proposed strategy is capable of distinguishing adenosine from its analogues. This strategy holds promise in adenosine related biomedical research, clinical diagnosis and disease treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Peroxynitrite (ONOO - ) is an important reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can react with a variety of biologically active species and cause many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders. Herein, we develop a novel far-red fluorescent probe DCM-KA, which is equipping with α-ketoamide moiety caged DCM-NH 2 . The probe exhibits fluorescence off-on response to ONOO - over other biological interfering analytes by ONOO - -induced α-ketoamide deprotection reaction. More importantly, the probe is biocompatible and has been successfully utilized to visualize endogenous ONOO - production in macrophage cell line J774A.1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This study focused on mortalin expression and its relevance to the prognosis in serous ovarian carcinoma, mortalin modulated cell malignant proliferation and EMT progression via Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. In this study, data obtained from Oncomine database, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) analysis and Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to assess the expression of mortalin in serous ovarian carcinoma. The prognostic value of mortalin was analyzed using Meier plotter database and Kaplan-Meier. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and colony formation assay were used to detect cell reproductive capacity. SK-OV-3 cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured by wound-healing, migration and western-blot assays. Data from Oncomine showed that mortalin was highly expressed in serous ovarian carcinomas compared with corresponding normal controls. Similar results were found in CCLE analysis and in clinical specimens. High mortalin expression was associated with high histological grade and worse overall survival (OS) rate. The results of MTT analyses, IF staining, and colony formation assay indicated that MKT-077 (1-Ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolylidene)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinylidene] methyl]-pyridinium chloride) suppressed the viability of SK-OV-3 cells. Besides, mortalin suppression restrained cell EMT progression by Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, mortalin is over-expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma. High mortalin expression could be a candidate for the prognostic indicator and a biomarker in serous ovarian carcinoma. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The optimization of cell culture modes and basal media is very important to improve the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but the underlying cellular mechanism has not been well investigated. The objective of this study was to elucidate the interaction between the intracellular proteome and key process parameters by employing comparative proteomics. Three cell culture operations and four basal media were characterized in the production of anti-HER2 mAb using CHO DG44. The representative host cell proteins that demonstrated significant responses to various culture modes and media, including the enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, transcription, translation, and post translational modification, were described. The fed-batch culture in a 2-L bioreactor produced mAb with a titer of 2411 mg/L using Dynamis medium. The purified mAb showed strong and specific targeting to HER2 + MDA-MB-361 cell and similar anti-cancer toxicity to the FDA approved Trastuzumab. Moreover, this proteomics study also indicated several key considerations for future rationally engineering a mAb production process, which could benefit biopharmaceutical manufacturing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Niclosamide, previously used as an anthelmintic drug is currently being repurposed for its anticancer activity. Niclosamide is a brick like biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) class II drug with poor aqueous solubility and dissolution consequently leading to low bioavailability. By considering the physicochemical properties and geometry of niclosamide, inclusion complex with cyclodextrin was prepared by freeze drying method and characterized using FT-IR, DSC, PXRD, and 1 HNMR. In silico molecular modeling study was performed to study the possible interactions between niclosamide and cyclodextrin. The anticancer activity of niclosamide formulation was evaluated through in vitro cell cytotoxicity study using various cancer cell lines. The potential of niclosamide complex for improvement of the bioavailability was evaluated in male BALB/c mice. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated significantly higher cytotoxicity at lower concentrations and the pharmacokinetic studies showed significant improvement in C max and T max of niclosamide from cyclodextrin complex in comparison to pure niclosamide alone. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hypochlorous acid (HOCl), on the one hand they can regulate physiological function in our living organisms, on the other hand abnormal concentration of ROS would induce a series of biomacromolecules damage and further endanger virtually all aspects of human health. Especially it can be directly related to cancer. Thus to elucidate and visualize their concentration is very imminent. Before many fluorescent probes were used to detect HOCl. In recent years, near-infrared or ratiometric fluorescent developed prosperously. The strategy of combining near-infrared and ratiometric fluorescent probe is overwhelming in the design of fluorescent probes. In this work, we successfully designed and obtained a near-infrared and ratiometric fluorescent probe with large stokes by reacting isophorone with coumarin, which can monitor HOCl high efficiently with quick response and low detection limit. In addition, cell imaging experiments show that the probe can identify endogenous and exogenous ClO − successfully, and nude mouse imaging experiments show that the probe can detect exogenous ClO − . It is possible that the probe can be applied in early clinical diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The ferrocene-hormone conjugate 16-ferrocenylidene-17β-estra-1,3,5-triene-3,17-diol crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell, space group P2 1 . The asymmetric unit cell contains two ferrocene-hormone conjugates, co-crystallized with two water and one acetonitrile molecules. The crystal structure shows a hydrogen bonding network within the hormone residues and the co-crystallized water and acetonitrile molecules. Hirshfeld surface and two-dimensional fingerprint plots were performed for each of the ferrocene-hormone conjugates in order to analyse weak intermolecular contacts. Particular attention is placed on hydrogen bond interactions in the crystal structure. A noncovalent OH-π intermolecular interaction was found in the crystal structure. DFT studies were employed using the long-range functional ωB97XD and 6–311 g** basis set to study such interactions. The existence of this OH-π intermolecular interaction contributes with −2.32 kcal/mol to the total energy of the crystalline structure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The experimental (FT-IR and Laser-Raman spectra) and theoretical (DFT studies) vibrational modes of (E)-N′-Hydroxy-1,3-diphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-5-carboximidamide were studied in detail. FT-IR and Laser-Raman data were collected in the range 4000-400 cm −1 and 4000-100 cm −1 , respectively in solid phase. Optimized structural parameters and frequency values were theoretically calculated using DFT/B3LYP and DFT/M06-2X chemical methods with 6–311++G (d,p) basis set by Gaussian 09W software. Theoretical frequency assignments and potential energy distributions (PED) analysis were performed by VEDA 4 program. With the optimized structures, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies and clouds were obtained and evaluated. Additionally, molecular docking studies for potent pyruvate kinase activators (PDB codes: 4RPP, 4FXJ, 4QG6, 4WJ8) and previously used targets (PDB codes: 2QU5, 2W1G and 2VTO-three different cancers related proteins) were employed for docking by AutoDock Vina program considering Swiss-Target reports and related literature knowledge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "BRAF V600E mutation is an important drive gene mutation and biomarker for tumor diagnosis, monitoring and target treatment. In order to meet the needs of identifying low abundance BRAF V600E mutation from real clinical specimens, a real time fluorescent biosensing strategy was developed by perfectly integrating dual padlock-gap-ligase chain reaction (DP-gLCR) with hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA). A pair of padlock probes was designed to induce DP-gLCR by using single-base gap coupling with matched deoxyribonucleotides substrates, which significantly increased the specificity of mutation discrimination. A large amount of circularized padlock probes were produced and triggered subsequent HRCA, generating numerous dendritic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) products for highly sensitive real time fluorescent biosensing. The designed biosensing strategy could detect as low as 200 zM mutation target and distinguish as low as 0.01% genomic DNA with B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) V600E mutation in 40 ng wild-type genomic DNA, which was equal to almost one copy of mutant genomic DNA.

    "Abstract": "Typically, sialic acids (SA) with a nine-carbon backbone are found at the glycan chain termini on the cell membranes, which play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. The expression level of SA in the blood serum has been reported to correlate with various disease states among cancer. In this study, a novel approach for preparing fluorescent boronic-acid-modified carbon dots (C-dots) for the detection of SA was developed. The functionalized C-dots were synthesized by a facile, one-step hydrothermal method using 3-pyridineboronic acid as the sole carbon source. The added SA selectively recognized the C-dots, leading to the fluorescence quenching of the C-dots in a linear range of 80–4000 μM with a detection limit of 54 μM. The as-developed boronic-acid nanoprobe was successfully applied for the detection of SA in human serum samples with satisfactory results. In addition, this method afforded results within 4 min. Compared to other methods, this new proposed approach was simpler and exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity, demonstrating immense potential as an alternative for SA detection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Benefits of exercise have been documented for many diseases with a chronic progression, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, certain types of cancers, and overall mortality. Low-grade systemic inflammation is a key component of these pathologies and it has been demonstrated that can be prevented by performing regularly physical exercise. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation on glucose and insulin tolerance, exercise performance, production of urinary neopterin and striatal neurotransmitters levels in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Increased blood glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity were observed after a single administration of glucose (2 g/kg, p.o.) or insulin (0.5 U/kg, i.p.). However, the repeated injection of LPS (0.33 mg/kg/day, i.p.) decreased glucose tolerance and increase urinary neopterin levels, pointing to systemic inflammation. In parallel to the urinary-increased neopterin, it was observed a significant reduction in the striatal dopamine levels and an increase in the serotonin/dopamine ratio. While a single LPS injection (0.33 mg/kg, i.p.) showed impaired performance in the incremental loading test (10 m/min, with 2 m/min increment every 3 min, at 9% grade), a moderate physical exercise protocol (treadmill for three weeks; 5 sessions/week; up to 50 min/day) prevented the exacerbation of immune system activation and preserved mitochondrial activity in skeletal muscle from mice with continuous LPS infusion (infusion pumps: 0.83 mg/kg/day, i.p.). In conclusion, the peripheral-induced inflammation elicited metabolic alterations that provoked impairment in striatal dopamine metabolism. The moderate exercise prevented the increase of urinary neopterin and preserved mitochondrial activity under LPS-induced inflammatory conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug that often causes acute kidney injury (AKI) in cancer patients. The contribution of miRNAs to the cisplatin-induced renal tubular epithelial cell injury remains largely unknown. Here we performed an integrative network analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles to shed light into the underlying mechanism of cisplatin-induced renal tubular epithelial cell injury. Microarray analysis identified 47 differentially expressed miRNAs, among them 26 were upregulated and 21 were downregulated. Moreover, integrating dysregulated miRNAs target prediction and altered mRNA expression enabled us to identify 1181 putative target genes for further bioinformatics analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the putative target genes were involved in apoptosis process and regulation of transcription. Pathway analysis indicated that the top upregulated pathways included MAPK and p53 signaling pathway, while the top downregulated pathways were PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling pathway. Further network analysis showed that MAPK signaling pathway and apoptosis with the highest degree were identified as core pathways, hsa-miR-9-3p and hsa-miR-371b-5p as the most critical miRNAs, and CASK, ASH1L, CDK6 etc. as hub target genes. In addition, the expression level change of selected five microRNAs (hsa-miR-4299, hsa-miR-297, hsa-miR-3135b, hsa-miR-9-3p, and hsa-miR-371b-5p) and two mRNAs(CASK and CDK6) were validated in cisplatin-induced HK-2 cells. Furthermore, a similar trend of expression level change was observed in NRK-52E cells by cisplatin treatment. Overall, our results provide the molecular basis and potential targets for the treatment of cisplatin-induced renal tubular cell injury. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in cancer development. Several studies have indicated that miRNAs mediate tumorigenesis processes, such as inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of the microRNA-185 (miR-185) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma (OS). MiR-185 expression was reduced in OS tissues and OS cell lines. MiR-185 inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase assay validated that vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) was a direct target of miR-185. Overexpression of miR-185 in OC cells reduced VAMP2 expression in protein and mRNA levels, whereas suppression of miR-185 led to an increase in VAMP2 protein and mRNA levels. In addition, we found that VAMP2 silencing inhibited the OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Further studies verified that introducing VAMP2 mRNA into cells over-expressing miR-185 abrogated the effects of miR-185 on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Therefore, these results confirm that decreased expression of miR-185 might be regarded as a tumor marker for the early diagnosis of OS, by manipulating of its interactive factors with VAMP2, to provide an effective novel therapeutic target for treatment of the OS tumor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptide LL-37 is ubiquitously expressed and secreted by epithelial cells of mucosal surfaces including the gastrointestinal tract, the primary absorption site of orally administered drugs and food components. Besides antimicrobial properties, LL-37 also contributes to the pathophysiology of various diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and cancer. Non-covalent association of antiinflammatory drugs, porphyrin pigments, bile salts and food dyes to the peptide was uncovered and evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. These agents induce the disorder-to-order conformational transition of the natively unstructured LL-37 leading to its helical folding. Even in the presence of chloride ions, when LL-37 is partially folded, the inducers were able to rise the α-helix content. CD titration data indicated positive cooperativity between the ligand molecules accommodated to the peptide chain resulting in multimeric complexes with apparent dissociation constants ranged from 2 to 500 μM. Computational docking suggested the prominent role of the Lys8-Arg19 segment in the accommodation of small molecules, governed principally by salt bridges and H-bonding. Since pleiotropic biological functions of LL-37 are strongly conformation-dependent, it could be anticipated that folding inducer compounds may modulate its in vivo actions and also of related cationic peptides. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This work reports a novel approach to monitor Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) biomarker with molecular-imprinting technology assembled on a conductive glass surface. For this purpose, the polymerization was achieved by electrical stimulus on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-glass modified with a homemade carbon ink (hCCI). The biomimetic material was assembled on top of this surface, by moulding CEA at the molecular level around a polyaminophenol (PAP) polymeric matrix. The CEA biomarker was previously incubated in the presence or not of aminophenylboronic acid (APBA), to evaluate the effect of negative charges at the rebinding site. Then, aminophenol (AP) monomer was electropolymerized on the modified FTO glass, acting as working electrode. The template was removed by enzymatic action. Likewise, a control material having only PAP and no CEA was also prepared. The resulting sensing films were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the chemical modifications on these after each stage of the assembly process was followed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies. Imprinted devices displayed good linear responses to CEA in EIS assays from 2.5 ng/mL to 1.5 μg/mL in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). A promising detection of CEA was, also, achieved in spiked foetal bovine serum (FBS) samples, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3 ng/mL. Overall, the devices developed herein are promising tools for monitoring CEA in point-of-care (POC) applications, being able to detect lower concentrations than those in normal physiological levels. In addition, the biosensors offer low cost, high sensitivity and good selectivity, and may be used to couple to other reading devices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are widely added to consumer products and building materials, which may pose potential health risk to humans. But information on their contamination and human exposure in the indoor environment especially dormitories in northern China is rare. In this study, twelve OPFRs were investigated in college dormitory dust that collected from Harbin, Shenyang, and Baoding, in northern China. Indoor dust samples were also collected from homes and public microenvironments (PMEs) in Harbin for comparison. The median ∑OPFR concentrations in dormitory dust in Shenyang samples (8690 ng/g) were higher than those in Baoding (6540 ng/g) and Harbin (6190 ng/g). The median ∑OPFR concentrations in home dust (7150 ng/g) were higher than in dormitory and PME dust (5340 ng/g) in Harbin. Tris(2‑chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) were the most abundant chlorinated OPFRs, while triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and tris(2‑butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) were the dominant non-chlorinated OPFRs. The daily intakes of ∑OPFR were estimated, with the median values for female students (2.45 ng/kg-day) higher than those for male students (2.15 ng/kg-day) while were similar to adults (2.45 ng/kg-day) in homes. The estimated daily intakes (EDI) of these OPFRs from indoor dust in Harbin were all below the recommended values. The calculated non-carcinogenic hazard quotients (10 −8 –10 −3 ) from OPFRs were much lower than the theoretical risk threshold. Meanwhile, carcinogenic risk (CR) of tri‑n‑butyl phosphate (TNBP), TCEP, tris(2‑ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP), and tris(1,3‑dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) were also estimated. The highest carcinogenic risk of TCEP for gender-specific and age-specific category range from 1.75 × 10 −7 to 2.46 × 10 −7 from exposure to indoor dust indicated a low potential carcinogenic risk for human exposure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The atypical orphan receptors DAX1 and SHP constitute the NR0B subgroup of human nuclear receptor (hNR) family; they play key roles in metabolism, reproduction, nutrition and steroidogenesis, and are involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases such as cancer and adrenal hypoplasia. The two receptors lack the classical DNA-binding domain and act as the corepressors of other hNRs. The DAX1 and SHP contains three and two conserved LXXLL motifs, respectively, which can be recognized and bound by the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of hNR proteins in agonist conformation. Here, we attempt to explore the systematic interaction profile between the five DAX1/SHP LXXLL motifs and all the 48 hNR AF-2 domains found in the human genome, to analyze the binding affinity and specificity of these motifs towards the complete domain array, and to design LXXLL-based, hydrocarbon-stapled peptides that can target the specific interaction profile for each motif. A weighted source–target network from motifs to domains is created based on the modeled domain–motif complex structures and calculated binding potencies, from which the specific interaction profile of each motif against the whole hNR array is depicted and clustered to measure the binding similarity and relationship among these motifs. Dynamics simulations reveal that the LXXLL-based peptides are highly flexible in free unbound state, thus unfavorable to be recognized and bound by AF-2 domains. Hydrocarbon-stapling technique is employed to help the constraint of these unstructured peptides to active helical conformation, thus largely improving their binding affinity to the hNR array. The hydrocarbon bridge is designed to point out of the domain's active pocket, which would not disrupt the direct interaction between the domain and peptide. Energetic decomposition imparts that the stapling has only a very modest influence on the interaction enthalpy and desolvation effect of domain–peptide binding, but can substantially reduce entropy penalty upon the binding. For a peptide ligand, the entropic reduction can be roughly regarded as a constant, which only improves (absolute) peptide binding affinity towards the whole domain array, but does not alter (relative) peptide binding specificity over different domains in the array. Overall, the stapled peptides can be considered as potent competitors to selectively target the specific interaction networks mediated by their parent LXXLL motifs in DAX1 and SHP proteins. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "P2X4 receptor (P2X4R), a subtype of P2 purinergic receptors, is an ATP-gated receptor through which activity of spinal microglia instigates pain hypersensitivity in various pain conditions. Accumulating evidence indicates that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) plays an important role in chronic pain facilitation, and it could stimulate microglia activation and involve in regulating P2X4R expression. However, the mechanism of MCP-1 in regulating the expression of P2X4R in microglia is poorly understood, and whether MCP-1 can aggravate pain via up-regulating spinal P2X4R expression in Cancer-induced Bone Pain (CIBP) remains unclear. In this study, we observed that Iba-1 and P2X4R expression is increased in microglia treated with MCP-1, and blockade with a selective CCR2 antagonist RS-504393 suppressed microglia activation and reduced P2X4R expression in cultured microglia. In response to MCP-1, the expression level of p-Akt was also increased and RS-504393 inhibited the increase. Besides, PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 could attenuate MCP-1-induced P2X4R expression in cultured microglia. MCP-1 was found to be associated with P2X4R expression and mechanical allodynia induced by CIBP in vivo since the expression of MCP-1 was increased in CIBP and RS-504393 alleviated the P2X4R expression and mechanical allodynia in CIBP.

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: The extensive biodiversity of plants in Southeast Asia and inadequate research hitherto warrant a continued investigation into medicinal plants. On the basis of a careful review of fresh medicinal plant usage to treat cancer from previous ethnobotanical interviews in Singapore and from the traditional uses of the indigenous plants, fresh leaves of seven locally grown medicinal plant species were evaluated for anti-proliferative activity. Aim of the study: To evaluate the anti-proliferative activity of local medicinal plant species Clausena lansium Skeels, Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau, Leea indica (Burm. f.) Merr., Pereskia bleo (Kunth) DC., Strobilanthes crispus (L.) Blume, Vernonia amygdalina Delile and Vitex trifolia L. Materials and method: Fresh, healthy and mature leaves of the seven medicinal plants were harvested from various locations in Singapore and Malaysia for Soxhlet, ultrasonication and maceration extractions in three different solvents (water, ethanol and methanol). Cell proliferation assay using water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay was performed on twelve human cancer cell lines derived from breast (MDA-MB-231, T47D), cervical (C33A), colon (HCT116), leukemia (U937), liver (HepG2, SNU-182, SNU-449), ovarian (OVCAR-5, PA-1, SK-OV-3) and uterine (MES-SA/DX5) cancer. Results: A total of 37 fresh leaf extracts from seven medicinal plants were evaluated for their anti-tumour activities in twelve human cancer cell lines. Of these, the extracts of C. lansium, L. indica, P. bleo, S. crispus, V. amygdalina and V. trifolia exhibited promising anti-proliferative activity against multiple cancer cell lines. Further investigation of selected promising leaf extracts indicated that maceration methanolic extract of L. indica was most effective overall against majority of the cancer cell lines, with best IC 50 values of 31.5 ± 11.4 µg/mL, 37.5 ± 0.7 µg/mL and 43.0 ± 6.2 µg/mL in cervical C33A, liver SNU-449, and ovarian PA-1 cancer cell lines, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study provide new scientific evidence for the traditional use of local medicinal plant species C. lansium, L. indica, P. bleo, S. crispus, V. amygdalina and V. trifolia in cancer treatment. These results highlight the importance of the upkeep of these indigenous plants in modern society and their relevance as resources for drug discovery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Radix Scutellariae (RS), the dried root of Scutellariae baicalensis Georgi, known as a herbal medicine in several Asian countries including China, has been widely used to treat inflammation, hypertension, cardiovascular disease as well as cancer. The total flavonoid aglycone extracted (TFAE) was extracted by ethyl acetate and this extraction methodology was optimized and obtained the protection of Chinese patents. Aim of the study: To investigate the underlying mechanism of the chemotherapeutic effects of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods: We performed CCK8 assays, AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining, flow cytometry assays, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot to study the molecular mechanism of TFAE in inducing autophagy and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Results: In vitro, TFAE exhibits significant anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer cell lines, especially for BxPC3 (IC 50 = 6.5 μg mL −1 ). Moreover, TFAE induces apoptosis and autophagy as evidenced by the increased apoptosis or autophagy-related protein level, the increased the fraction of apoptotic cells and the punctuate patterns of LC3 II. Furthermore, TFAE induce autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, pharmacological block autophagy by 3-MA enhanced TFAE-induced apoptosis, indicating that TFAE induced autophagy functions as a cytoprotective process against apoptosis. In vivo, 150 mg/kg TFAE inhibited the BxPC3 tumor growth in immune deficient mice with the inhibitory rate of 66.87% and induced both apoptosis and autophagy. Conclusion: TFAE have anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer and can induce apoptosis and autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway. TFAE might be a potential anticancer drug to be further developed for human pancreatic cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Jianpi Yangzheng Xiaozheng Decoction (JPYZXZ) is an empirical compound prescription based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. JPYZXZ, which is “Qi-invigorating, spleen-strengthening and stasis-removing,” can improve the quality of life of gastric cancer patients and prolong their survival; however, the exact mechanism underlying the antitumor effects of this compound is still not clear. Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to clearly define the effect of JPYZXZ and its components, Jianpi Yangzheng Decoction (JPYZ) and Xiao Zheng San Jie Decoction (XZSJ), on inhibiting the progression of gastric cancer. Materials and methods: The effect of JPYZXZ and its components on the motility of gastric cancer MGC-803 cells was measured by MTT, adhesion, transwell assays and wound-healing assays. JPYZXZ, JPYZ and XZSJ were administered to 615 mice with gastric cancer xenografts, and their effect on the inhibition of subcutaneous transplantation was analyzed. THP-1 monocyte cells were used to establish tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) models. The polarized state of the TAMs was detected by Flow Cytometry, ELISA and Immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression of tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and TAM-related genes was determined by Real-time PCR and Western Blot, respectively. Results: We determined that both JPYZXZ and its components inhibited the progress of gastric cancer in vitro, and JPYZXZ was clearly more effective than JPYZ or XZSJ. The in vivo results demonstrated that the JPYZXZ and XZSJ group exhibited a significant decrease in the tumor weight compared to the control group. Further analysis indicated that JPYZXZ was more active than JPYZ or XZSJ in inhibiting the gastric cancer EMT transformation both in vivo and in vitro. However, JPYZ was more effective compared with JPYZXZ for inducing the phenotypic change in macrophages from M2 to M1. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that both JPYZXZ and its components prevent the progress of gastric cancer. JPYZXZ inhibits the gastric cancer EMT more effectively than JPYZ and XZSJ, but JPYZ primarily works to regulate the phenotypic change in macrophages from M2 to M1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic pollutants for which some are known carcinogens, there is limited information on the cancer risk such substances pose to the population via marine sediments, despite a significant part of the world's food supply being derived from the coastal environment. This study was conducted in a heavily industrialized and urbanized coastal area, in Trinidad. PAHs were quantified in sediments during the dry and wet seasons and were observed to be significantly higher in the wet season compared to the dry season. Also emerging from this study is that PAH levels were lower, in the areas where natural gas is the dominant energy source for industries, compared with those areas where crude oil-based fossil fuel is predominantly used. Perylene levels were demonstrated to be of biogenic origin near the protected wetland area. It was observed that nearshore sediment PAHs concentrations were higher than offshore levels. The sources of PAHs, identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) in the marine sediments, were vehicular combustion of gasoline and diesel, biomass burning, industrial combustion and oil spills. The mean Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risks (ILCR) due to fish consumption from this region during the dry and wet seasons was &gt;1 × 10 −4 , indicating a high cancer risk to the human population. The annual non-cancer risk (HQ) was high &gt;1 at the 90th percentile level with an adverse risk to about 14% of the population. These results can be utilized for developing an effective environmental management policy for coastal areas in Trinidad and the wider Caribbean region, given that much of the islands’ populations depend on the coastal regions for seafood. In addition, these results may assist in boosting current efforts of policymakers, towards phasing out crude oil-based fossil fuels for cleaner energy sources, such as compressed natural gas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Amorphophalli Rhizoma has been widely used as an adjuvant treatment for advanced or metastatic breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatoma, and malignant lymphoma, but its molecular mechanism of action for treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally poorly understood. Aim of the study: To investigate genomic changes related to the inhibitory effect of Amorphophalli Rhizoma and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this inhibition in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Materials and methods: Gene chip analysis was employed to explore genomic changes caused by Amorphophalli Rhizoma in TNBC cells. Potential classical signaling pathways, upstream regulators, functions, regulatory effects and gene interaction networks were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA interference (RNAi) assays were used to clarify the roles of potential target genes. Results: In total, 536 significantly upregulated and 648 significantly downregulated genes were identified between the group treated with Amorphophalli Rhizoma extract and that treated with vehicle. Many of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in TNBC cells are involved in DNA replication, recombination and repair, the cell cycle, and cellular assembly and organization. Attenuation of KNL1, OLFML2A, RTKN2 and SGO1 gene expression by Amorphophalli Rhizoma significantly induced cell cycle arrest and suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Conclusions: The inhibitory effects of Amorphophalli Rhizoma in TNBC cells likely occur through regulation of the spindle checkpoint, chromosomal and centrosomal instability, and cell membrane stability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Studies have shown that the etiology and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer are closely related to the tumor microenvironment, and the cancer tissue is still in the state of “energy deficit” and has to promote energy generation through high glycolysis. Rhus chinensis Mill is a Chinese herbal medicine used to treat various types of solid tumors in China. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease group caused by abnormal changes in glucose metabolism resulted in lactic acid production, which remodels acidosis. Aim of the study: Although previous studies have shown that the active compounds of Rhus chinensis Mill. can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, whether its triterpenoids could effectively regulate glycolysis involved in CRC have not been systematically investigated. Materials and methods: In this study, the extraction of triterpenoids extract from Rhus chinensis Mill. was obtained, and cell viability assay, the percentage of apoptosis for CRC cells were counted, and matrigel invasion assay and production of lactic acid and glucose uptake assay was determined. we further examined the expression of the key glycolytic enzymes and acid-sending ion channel (ASIC) family members of SW620 cells, and some key proteins in the glycolytic pathway were further verified. Results: Notably, triterpenoids (TER) of Rhus chinensis Mill. showed effective anti-proliferative activity and significantly altered protein levels associated with CRC cell survival and glycolysis metabolism. TER could down-regulate the expression of ASIC2, in CRC SW620 cell line. Most importantly, the levels of ASIC2 and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were also down-regulated by TER. Furthermore, inhibition of activated the ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT1 pathway and target gene transcript expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in parallel to reduce, and resulted in the reduced invasion ability by TER treatment. Conclusion: The potential pathways and targets that involved in glycolysis to excert the anti-CRC effects of main compounds in triterpenoids of Rhus chinensis Mill. were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Our findings thus provided rational evidence that inhibition of the ASIC2-induced calcineurin/NFAT pathway by triterpenoids in Rhus chinensis Mill. profoundly suppressed cell growth and invasion in CRC, which target alternative glycolysis in colorectal tumor cells, may be a useful adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Fagara tessmannii Engl. is an African medicinal plant used in Cameroonian traditional medicine to treat various types of cancers. Aim of the study: This work was designed to determine the cytotoxicity of the crude extract (FTB), fractions (FTBa-d) and compounds isolated from the bark of Fagara tessmannii, namely lupeol (1), fagaramide (2), zanthoxyline (3), hesperidin (4), nitidine chloride (5), fagaridine chloride (6), and β-sitosterol-3-O-β- D -glucopyranoside (7). The study was extended to the mode of induction of apoptosis by FTB, compounds 5 and 6. Materials and methods: The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of samples. The cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry. Column chromatography was used for the purification of FTB. Meanwhile, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis was applied for structural elucidation. Results: The crude extract, fractions FTBa, FTBc, FTBd as well as compounds 5 and 6 revealed cytotoxicity towards the 9 tested cancer cell lines. The IC 50 values ranged from 17.34 µg/mL (towards U87MG.ΔEGFR glioblastoma cells) to 40.68 µg/mL (against CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) for FTB, from 16.78 µg/mL (towards U87. MGΔEGFR cells) to 37.42 µg/mL (against CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells) for FTBa, from 19.47 µg/mL (towards U87. MG glioblastoma cells) to 41.62 µg/mL (against CCRF-CEM cells) for FTBc, from 14.17 µg/mL (against HCT116p53 -/- colon adenocarcinoma cells) to 22.28 µg/mL (towards CEM-ADR5000 cells) for FTBd, from 1.75 µM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 23.52 µM (against U87. MGΔEGFR cells) for compound 5, from 1.69 µM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 22.06 µM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for compound 6 and from 0.02 µM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96 µM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. FTB induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by enhanced ROS production. Compound 5 induced apoptosis through caspases activation and increase ROS production. Meanwhile, 6 induced apoptosis mediated by caspases activation, MMP alteration and enhanced ROS production. Conclusion: Fagara tessmannii as well as its constituents 5 and 6 revealed considerable cytotoxicity and may be suitable candidates deserving to be further explored to develop new anticancer drugs to combat sensitive and resistant phenotypes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is critically involved in cell migration, spreading and proliferation at the early step of various cancers. Small molecule inhibitors of FAK are effective to inhibit its activation in the process of tumor formation in cell. To better understand biotransformation of FAK inhibitors, this work has investigated in vitro phase I metabolism of inhibitors (namely PF-573228, PF-562271 and PF-03814735) by rat liver microsomes model. Using liquid chromatography - quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF/MS and MS/MS), three metabolites of PF-573228 and PF-562271 were observed and characterized, respectively. These in vitro metabolites were reported for the first time. The structures and fragmentation patterns of these metabolites were elucidated, and phase I metabolic pathways for FAK inhibitors were proposed. The main metabolic pathways of PF-573228 were hydroxylation, dehydrogenation and N-dealkylation. For PF-562271, they were hydroxylation and dehydrogenation. Hydroxylation was observed as the primary metabolism for PF-0381473. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Elderly people represent about the 15% of the total world population and often include a polymedicated age group with an average consumption of 5–10 pills per day. The main pharmaceuticals consumed are antianalgesics, antidiabetics, anti-parkinson compounds, anti-convulsants, drugs to treat constipation and drugs to treat cancer. In this study, we have developed a multiresidue method for the analysis of 44 selected pharmaceuticals prioritized according to the foremost consumption by the elderly in effluents from senior residences. Given the complexity of these waters, method optimization included the selection of the extraction cartridge, pH and volume, and the optimization of the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry conditions to minimize matrix effects and obtain high yields. Good method performance was obtained, with recoveries between 27 and 116% and high sensitivity. The method was tested in a preliminar study to determine pharmaceuticals released in situ from the untreated effluents of the senior residences. High concentrations were detected, with levels between 0.20 and 2891 μg L −1 attributed to the high consumption of drugs in the studied residences, which gather around 100 residents. The most detected pharmaceuticals were aspirin, macrogol, levofloxacin, cyclophosphamide, diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, pregabalin, quetiapine, chlormetiazole, trazodone, caffeine, 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol and amylmetacresol. This study describes the analytical conditions to determine the outmost consumed pharmaceuticals in wastewaters released from senior residences. © 2019",

Aim of the study: The present study assessed the sub-chronic oral toxicity of an aqueous extract of lithospermi radix (WLR) in Fischer 344 rats over a period of 13 weeks. Materials and methods: The chemical compositions of WLR were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). WLR was daily administered to Fischer 344 rats at 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weights (bw) for 13 weeks via oral gavage. Changes in mortalities, body weights, and intakes of food and water were monitored during the WLR treatment period. Urine was collected and analyzed 12 h before necropsy. Organ weights, hematological parameters, and plasma biochemical parameters were determined along with histopathological examination. Results: When compared with the normal control group, no remarkable toxic signs or parameter variations related with WLR treatment were observed in mortality, body weights, organ weights, food and water consumptions, urinalysis, hematological and plasma biochemical analyses, and histopathological examination. Mortalities observed in one male at 2000 mg/kg bw and three females at 1000 mg/kg bw were not related with WLR treatment because no gross findings of toxicity were observed in both morphological and histological examination. Some significant changes in clinical parameters or histological lesions observed in WLR-treated animals were not related with WLR treatment because the differences were marginal and did not show dose-dependent or directional changes. Conclusions: Based on these findings, the calculated no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) in rats was higher than 2000 mg/kg bw. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Certain volatile disinfection by-products (DBPs) off-gassing from pool water can cause eye and skin irritations, respiratory problems, and even cancer. No guidelines or recommendations concerning DBPs in the air exist in Norway. Traditionally, ventilation strategies in indoor swimming pools are based on reducing condensation on the windows rather than ensuring proper air quality in the users’ breathing zone. A total of 93 air samples of airborne concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs) were collected via stationary sampling. We investigated the distribution of total THM (tTHM) 0.05 m and 0.60 m above the water surface at six different locations in the poolroom and the covariation between the water and air quality parameters. Based on a linear mixed effects model, the most important determinants in terms of predicting the air concentration of CHCl 3 were height above water surface, air changes of fresh air per hour, concentration of combined chlorine in the water, relative humidity (RH) and day of the week. Approximately 36% of the total variability could be attributed to these variables; hence, to reduce the average exposure in the poolroom, hazard control should focus on these variables. Based on the identified predictor variables, the supplied air should be controlled based on water quality in addition to the traditional control censors for RH and air temperature used in the ventilation system of Norwegian swimming facilities. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Zeliangrong people with their yearlong experiences still depend on the medicinal plants for primary healthcare. Some of the medicinal plants used by the community exhibits established pharmacological activities which signify the importance of the traditional knowledge of the tribes. Besides, many other species traditionally used by the tribes assume to have pharmacological potentiality. Aim of the study: The study aimed to identify the medicinally and pharmacologically important species with understanding the traditional healing practices and to compare medicinal plant knowledge among the informants of the three tribes under Zeliangrong group. Material and methods: Data were collected by interviewing selected 27 herbal healers using modified semi-structured questionnaires. Identification and documentation of all the species have been made using standard taxonomic procedure. Ethnomedicinal uses of all the recorded species was analyzed with computation of the use reports for each species and Informant Consensus Factor. Results: The study recorded 145 medicinal plants used in healing practices by the Zeliangrong tribes. Except 2 species, all are Angiospermic plants found mostly in wild condition. These medicinal plants are used for treating about 59 different health ailments categorized under 13 ICPC disease categories. Highest ICF (0.75) was found in Digestive disorder with 174 use reports for 44 plant species. Besides the established medicinal plants in the Indian System of medicine like Acorus calamus, Centella asiatica, Oroxylum indicum and Phyllanthus emblica, a number of other species like Ageratum conizoides, Blumeopsis flava, Clerodendrum glandulosum, Gynura cusimbua, Hedyotis scandens and Paederia foetida also has maximum use reports. Among the species with higher use reports, 2 species namely Clerodendrum glandulosum and Paederia foetida are exclusively used for the treatment of hypertension, and bone fracture and sprain respectively indicating their remarkable medicinal values and acceptability. Out of the total 145 species, only 24 are shared by all the three tribes with 11 species used for similar diseases. Conclusion: The medicinal plants with higher use reports can be evaluated for validation of pharmacological activities and their toxicity. The Indigenous Knowledge System of Zeliangrong community for herbal remedies may be of immense value in pharmacological experimentation particularly for the uses like malaria, health tonic, cancer, jaundice, hypertension and diabetes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Marsdenia tenacissima (Roxb.) Wight et Arn is a vine distributed in southwest area of China and used in folk medicine for treatment of tumors. Recent decades of studies on this plant reveal its synergistic effects with certain anticancer drugs in cancer therapy. In our previous study, an extract ETA which contains total aglycones made from M. tenacissima significantly enhanced antitumor activity of paclitaxel in tumor-bearing mice. However, the effective constituents in ETA and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of the study: Reveal the active components in ETA as well as the molecular mechanism in enhancing antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel. Material and methods: Main constituents in ETA were purified by chemical methods. Effects of the purified constituents on metabolic activity of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in human liver microsomes. Ability of the constituents to enhance antitumor activity of paclitaxel were investigated in nude mice bearing HeLa tumors. Pharmacokinetic study was performed in SD rats. Molecular docking was carried out for investigation of drug-protein interactions. Results: Three main C 21 steroidal aglycones, 11α-O-tigloyl-12β-O-acetyl-tenacigenin B (MT1), 11α-O-2-methylbutanoyl-12β-O-tigloyl-tenacigenin B (MT2) and 11α-O-2-methylbutanoyl-12β-O-acetyl-tenacigenin B (MT3), together with tenacigenin B (MT4) was prepared from ETA. Among them, MT1, MT2 and MT3 strongly inhibit the metabolic activity of CYP3A4. MT2 also showed inhibitory effects on CYP2C8, CYP2B6 and CYP2C19. In HeLa tumor xenografts, MT1, MT2 and MT3 (30 mg/kg) did not affect tumor growth themselves, but significantly enhanced paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition. In addition, coadministration of MT2 with paclitaxel resulted in significant reduction of liver CYP2C8. In pharmacokinetic study, MT2 significantly increased the blood concentration of paclitaxel with increased AUC value by 2.2–5.3 folds. Molecular docking analysis suggested hydrophobic interaction modes of tenacigenin B derivatives with CYP3A4, and also the essential roles of the C-11 and C-12 ester groups for effective interaction with CYP3A4. Conclusion: Our study proves that, 11α-O-tigloyl-12β-O-acetyl-tenacigenin B, 11α-O-2-methylbutanoyl-12β-O-tigloyl-tenacigenin B and 11α-O-2-methylbutanoyl-12β-O-acetyl-tenacigenin B, which are the main constituents of ETA, are active inhibitors of CYP3A4 with potential to increase therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4. Tenacigenin B derivatives with C-11 and C-12 ester group substitutions, or at least a large part of them, are active components in ETA and M. tenacissima to enhance in vivo antitumor efficacies of paclitaxel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, polyaniline nanospindles have been synthesized using iron oxide as sacrificial template. These nanospindles were utilized for the fabrication of PANI-MoS 2 nanoflower architectures via hydrothermal route. The electrostatic interaction between PANI and MoS 2 improves the conductivity and provides more direct paths for charge transportation. SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy techniques were employed to explore the crystal structure, and morphological properties of the PANI-MoS 2 nanocomposite. Furthermore, an electrochemical biosensing platform based on PANI-MoS 2 nanocomposite was fabricated for the specific detection of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique. The binding interactions between the pDNA/PANI-MoS 2 /ITO bioelectrode and target DNA sequence were also studied. The biosensor exhibits high sensitivity and wide detection range (10 −6 M to 10 −17 M) of target DNA with low detection limit (3 × 10 −18 M). Additionally, the specificity studies of the genosensor with various target DNA sequences (complementary, noncomplementary and one base mismatch) and real samples analysis of CML shows its potential for clinical diagnostics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The protein prenylation (or S-prenylation) is one of the most essential modifications, required for the association of membrane of a plethora of signalling proteins with the key biological process such as protein trafficking, cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Due to the ubiquitous nature of S-prenylation and its role in cellular functions, any defect in the biosynthesis or regulation of the isoprenoid leads to the occurrence of a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic issues, cardiovascular diseases and one of the most fatal diseases, cancer. This depicts the strong biological significance of S-prenylation, thus, the timely and accurate identification of S-prenylation sites is crucial and may provide with possible ways to understand the mechanism of this modification in proteins. To avoid laborious, resource demanding and expensive experimental techniques of identifying S-prenylation sites, here, we propose a novel predictor namely SPrenylC-PseAAC by integrating the Chou's Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) and relative/absolute position-based features. A 2-tier classification was performed i.e., at first level, identification of prenylation and non-prenylation sites is performed, while at the second level, identification of S-farnesylation and S-geranylgeranylation sites is performed. Using jackknife, perdition model validation gave 95.31% accuracy for tier-1 classification and 91.42% for tier 2 classification, while for 10-fold cross-validation, it gave 93.68% accuracy for tier-1 classification and 89.70% for tier 2 classification. Thus the proposed predictor can help in predicting the Prenylation sites in an efficient and accurate way. The SPrenylC-PseAAC is available at (biopred.org/prenyl). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Despite the massive efforts to develop the treatment of pancreatic cancers, no effective application exhibits satisfactory clinical outcome. Macropinocytosis plays a critical role for continuous proliferation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this study, we generated a screening method and identified phellodendrine chloride (PC) as a potential macropinocytosis inhibitor. PC significantly inhibited the viability of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2) in a dose-dependent manner; however, it did not affect the wild type KRAS pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC-3). Further experiments indicated that PC reduced the growth of PANC-1 cells through inhibition of macropinocytosis and diminishing the intracellular glutamine level. Disruption of glutamine metabolism led to enhance the reactive oxygen species level and induce mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization in PANC-1 cells. PC treatment caused increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression, along with the activation of cleaved caspase-3, 7, 9 and cleaved-PARP, thus induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, PC inhibited macropinocytosis in vivo and effectively reduced the growth of PANC-1 xenograft tumors. All together, we demonstrated that inhibition of macropinocytosis might be an effective strategy to treat pancreatic cancers. Thus, PC could be a potential compound with improved therapeutic efficacy in patients with pancreatic cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR–TKIs) have become a standard therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with sensitive mutations. However, acquired resistance inevitably emerges after a median of 6–12 months. It has been demonstrated that autophagy plays an important role in EGFR–TKI resistance. 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) is proposed to sensitize the cancer cells to chemotherapy by inhibiting autophagy. We examined the ability of Rg3 to inhibit autophagy and increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to icotinib. We show that the induction of autophagy in response to icotinib contributes to the development of icotinib resistance. Rg3 is capable of inhibiting autophagic flux and enhancing the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to icotinib. The resistance to icotinib could also be reversed through Rg3-induced autophagy inhibition. Autophagy inhibition by Rg3 increases the therapeutic response in both icotinib-sensitive and icotinib-resistant NSCLC cells with an EGFR-activating mutation and may be an effective new treatment strategy for this disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Surgery resection is the primary treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with the risk of cancer dissemination and metastasis. Sevoflurane is one inhalational anesthesia which regulates migration and invasion in varying cancers. However, the effect of sevoflurane on CRC cells and its mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, SW620 and HCT116 cells were treated with different concentrations of sevoflurane for 6 h in vitro. We measured the effect of sevoflurane on cell survival, migration and invasion by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide or trans-well assays. Moreover, we explored the interaction between sevoflurane and miR-203 and Roundabout1 (Robo1) as well as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) pathway. Results showed that sevoflurane inhibited cell migration and invasion in SW620 and HCT116 cells in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, different concentrations of sevoflurane suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK. miR-203 expression was impaired while sevoflurane reversed the expression of miR-203 in CRC cells. In addition, inhibition of miR-203 attenuated the inhibitory effect of sevoflurane on cell migration, invasion and phosphorylated ERK level. Notably, MMP-9, as a downstream of ERK, was involved in sevoflurane-mediated processes in CRC cells. Besides, Robo1 was indicated as a target of miR-203 and inhibited by sevoflurane treatment. These results indicated that sevoflurane suppressed cell migration and invasion through regulating ERK/MMP-9 pathway via miR-203/Robo1 in CRC cells, indicating important clinical implications for anesthetic agents to prevent metastasis in CRC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Two new trinuclear Co(II) cluster-based compounds, namely [Co 3 (L) 2 (H 2 O) 4 ] n (1) and [Co 1.5 (L)(H 2 O) 2 ] n (2) (H 3 L = biphenyl-3,4’,5-tricarboxylic acid), have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions via tuning reaction temperature. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that both compound 1 and 2 contain trinuclear Co(II) cluster subunits: trinuclear [Co 3 (COO) 4 (H 2 O) 2 ] cluster for 1 and trinuclear [Co 3 (COO) 6 ] cluster for 2. Due to the different coordination modes of L 3− ligand, compound 1 features a (3,6)-connected 3D framework with a rtl-type topology, and compound 2 features a (3,6)-connected 3D framework with a new topology which has not been reported in the TOPOS and RCSR database. The thermal stabilities and luminescent properties for the two compounds have been investigated. The photophysical properties studies showed that compounds 1 and 2 are excellent candidiates as potential semiconductive materials. Moreover, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit high photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under UV light irradiation. In addition, the cytotoxicity of complexes 1 and 2 has been evaluated against three human breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) via the MTT assay. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Magnetic oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) have been extensively utilized in a wide range of biomedical applications, in order to improve the efficiency of the MNPs in therapeutic applications, there for in the present work high quality cobalt oxide magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized with a green solid state approach using cochineal powder (a natural and environmentally friendly source) as a biosynthetic precursor. This method is novel, green, simple, one step, surfactant free, solvent free, low temperature and fast. A natural complex of Co(NO 3 ) 2 - cochineal prepared and thermally decomposed in 400, 500 and 600 °C. The synthesized-nanoparticles were characterized by; scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). MTT assay performed to determine the cytotoxicity and anti-cancer effect of the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles against 4T1 cell lines. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining methods, DAPI staining was applied in order to investigate the mechanism of cell death. The effect of the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles on oxidative stress studied as well using the H 2 DCF-DA assay used for the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation study. The results demonstrate that the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles significantly reduced the survival percentage of 4T1 cells of breast cancer with that IC 50 of 2 mg/ml. The dominant mechanism of cell death was apoptosis, along with an increase in cellular oxidative stress. Therefore, the Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles prepared here can be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancer cells. However, further in vivo study is required to confirm it ’ s effect. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Waste electrical and electronic equipment (E-waste) recycling provides post-consumption economic opportunities, can also exert stress on environment and human health. This study investigated emissions, compositional proﬁles, and health risks associated with polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at five workshops (electric blowers to treat mobile phones (EBMP), electric heating furnaces to treat televisions (EHFTV) and routers (EHFR), and rotatory incinerators to treat televisions (RITV) and hard disks (RIHD)) within an e-waste dismantling industrial park. Total suspended particulate (TSP), PBDE, and PCB concentrations were 490-1530 μg m −3 , 26.6−11,800 ng m −3 and 6.4–19.8 ng m −3 in different workshops, respectively. Tetra-BDEs were dominant in TV recycling workshops, whereas deca-BDEs were in other workshops. BDE-47, -99, and -209 were the most abundant PBDEs during e-waste recycling activities (expect in RIHD workshop). Penta-CBs were present at high levels in TV workshops, as were tetra-CBs in RIHD workshop. Low brominated BDEs contributed a large portion during working and non-working time. The percentages of octa-BDEs and nona-BDEs were higher during non-working than working time. PBDEs posed a higher non-cancer risk; PCBs posed cancer risk to workers through inhalation in TV workshops. This study provides insights into environmental characterization of PBDEs and PCBs during e-waste recycling processes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "A systematic study on sulfonamide derivatives with salicylamide core is presented for possible use in pharmaceutical applications. The molecular structure of eight different compounds has been investigated by FTIR in the frequency range 4000–400 cm −1 to recognize the possible geometrical shape of the molecules needed to uniquely identify the activity of molecule in cancer cell. The electronic charge distribution of these different compounds is further illustrated by UV–Vis spectroscopy in the frequency range 190–1100 nm. The theoretical results obtained from molecular modeling calculations showed that the hydrogen bonds between the O–H, C[dbnd]O, N–H, and/or C–H groups vary from one compound to the other regarding their number and bond length. This confirms the experimental FTIR results regarding the position and broadening of the O–H and N–H groups due to free rotation of the amide group because of changing the compounds structure by adding different groups to the last phenyl ring. The hydrogen bonds take different directions and values from one compound to the other, which seems to be the most important factor regarding the activity of these different compounds in cancer cell. Both theoretical molecular modeling calculations and FTIR experimental results have strongly evaluated the relation between the chemical structure of 5-chloro-N (4-sulfamoylbenzyl) salicylamide derivatives and their biological activities. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Overexpression of CyclinD1-pRb pathway is observed in many types of cancers. Discovery of novel lead molecules as CDK4 (a key regulator of the cell cycle) specific inhibitors is, therefore, a leading research area in cancer therapeutic field. The present study is focused on evolving multiple 2D and 3D QSAR models with good statistical fit based on the structures of 59, Thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl hydrazones with diverse CDK4 inhibitory activity profile. Statistical validation (both internal and external) based on Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development principles resulted in five comparable models that can furnish a valid correlation between their structure and activity quantitatively. The resultant models have R 2 &gt; 0.70, very low standard deviation (SD &lt; 0.4) and external validation scores with Q 2 &gt; 0.65. The consensus prediction using the three top-ranked kernel based partial least square models revealed to be more useful for discriminating CDK4 inhibitory molecules from others. Docking analysis was beneficial in establishing the crucial hydrogen bonding interactions with hinge region residue Val96, Asp99 and Glu144. Salt bridge formation also found to be enhancing the CDK4 inhibition. High negative binding energy difference during solvation establishes the stability of the docked poses. The studies reveal that consensus prediction using the KPLS models along with docking observations can be used for screening databases of molecules with various structural features for finding out potential lead molecules with CDK4 inhibition. © 2019",
