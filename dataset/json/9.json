    "Abstract": "In this study, a nanocarrier was prepared for the codelivery of a hydrophilic drug (doxorubicin) and a hydrophobic drug (curcumin) to cancer cells. In this nanocarrier, the edges of graphene oxide sheets were decorated with a magnetic-functionalized polyamidoamine dendrimer with hydrazone groups at the end of the polymer. The edge functionalization of graphene sheets not only improved the solubility and dispersibility of graphene sheets but also imparted the magnetic properties to the nanocarrier. The resulting nanocarrier was loaded with doxorubicin through the covalent linkage and curcumin through π-π stacking. The nanocarrier showed a pH-sensitive release for both drugs, and the drug release behavior was also improved by the coimmobilization of both drugs. The cytotoxicity assay of nanocarrier showed low toxicity toward MCF-7 cell compared to unmodified graphene oxide, which was attributed to the presence of a magnetic dendrimer. Besides, the drug-loaded nanocarrier was highly toxic for cells even more than for free drugs. The cellular uptake images revealed higher drug internalization for coloaded nanocarrier than for the nanocarrier loaded with one drug alone. All of the results showed that the codelivery of curcumin and doxorubicin in the presence of the nanocarrier was more effective in chemotherapy than the nanocarrier loaded with one drug. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Recent advances in sequencing technology have allowed us to investigate personal genomes to find structural variations, which have been studied extensively to identify their association with the physiology of diseases such as cancer. In particular, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are one of the major constituents of the human genomes, and cause genome instability by insertion, mutation, and rearrangement. Result: We have developed a new program, iMGEins, to identify such novel MGEs by using sequencing reads of individual genomes, and to explore the breakpoints with the supporting reads and MGEs detected. iMGEins is the first MGE detection program that integrates three algorithmic components: discordant read-pair mapping, split-read mapping, and insertion sequence assembly. Our evaluation results showed its outstanding performance in detecting novel MGEs from simulated genomes, as well as real personal genomes. In detail, the average recall and precision rates of iMGEins are 96.67 and 100%, respectively, which are the highest among the programs compared. In the testing with real human genomes of the NA12878 sample, iMGEins shows the highest accuracy in detecting MGEs within 20 bp proximity of the breakpoints annotated. Conclusion: In order to study the dynamics of MGEs in individual genomes, iMGEins was developed to accurately detect breakpoints and report inserted MGEs. Compared with other programs, iMGEins has valuable features of identifying novel MGEs and assembling the MGEs inserted. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a form of As commonly found in drinking water and in some foods. Overwhelming evidence suggests that people chronically exposed to iAs are at risk of developing cancer or cardiovascular, neurological, and metabolic diseases. Although the mechanisms underlying iAs-associated illness remain poorly characterized, a growing body of literature raises the possibility that microRNAs (miRNAs), post-transcriptional gene suppressors, may serve as mediators and/or early indicators of the pathologies associated with iAs exposure. To characterize the circulating miRNA profiles of individuals chronically exposed to iAs, samples of plasma were collected from 109 healthy residents of the city of Zimapán and the Lagunera area in Mexico, the regions with historically high exposures to iAs in drinking water. These plasma samples were analyzed for small RNAs using high-throughput sequencing and for iAs and its methylated metabolites. Associations between plasma levels of arsenic species and miRNAs were evaluated. Six circulating miRNAs (miRs-423-5p, -142-5p -2, -423-5p +1, -320c-1, -320c-2, and -454-5p), two of which have been previously linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes (miRs-423-5p, -454-5p), were found to be significantly correlated with plasma MAs. No miRNAs were associated with plasma iAs or DMAs after correction for multiple testing. These miRNAs may represent mechanistic links between iAs exposure and disease or serve as markers of disease risks associated with this exposure. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "A multifunctional nanoplatform that enables the integration of biological detection, imaging diagnosis, and synergistic therapy into a single nanostructure holds great promise for nanoscience and nanomedicine. Herein, a novel theranostic platform was presented for label-free imaging of cell surface glycans based on DNA/silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) via hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and fluorescence guided photothermal therapy (PTT). In this strategy, a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-functionalized DNA and two hairpin structures of DNA/AgNCs probes were involved. Following metabolic glycan labeling, the binding of DBCO-functionalized DNA to cell surface initiated HCR, and then cell surface glycans were specifically labeled by DNA/AgNCs fluorescent probes. Furthermore, this signal amplification strategy was adopted in quantitative analysis, and the detection limit could be achieved as low as 20 cells in 200 μL of binding buffer. Moreover, the remarkable photothermal properties of DNA/AgNCs via HCR led to efficient killing of cancer cells and inhibited the tumor growth under imaging guide. In this strategy, DNA/AgNCs were utilized to detect the cellular glycans, which aided in overcoming the high cost and instability of fluorescent dyes. Simultaneously, the HCR process avoided the introduction of excessive azido-sugars under the precondition of ensuring apparent fluorescence. These results indicated that the developed nanoplatform has great potential for specific cell surface glycans imaging and fluorescence guided PTT. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "A nanoengineered interface fabricated by self-assembly enables the online determination of vitamin B12 via a simple luminescence readout in serum without any pretreatment. The interplay of Tm3+-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles (UCNPs) and a gold nanotriangle array prepared by nanosphere lithography on a glass slide is responsible for an efficient NIR to UV upconversion. Hot spots of the gold assembly generate local electromagnetic-field enhancement, favoring the four-photon upconversion process at the low-power excitation of approximately 13 W·cm-2. An improvement by about 6 times of the intensity for the emission peaking at 345 nm is achieved. The nanoengineered interface has been applied in a proof-of-concept sensor for vitamin B12 in serum, which is known as a marker for the risk of cancer; Alzheimer disease; or, during pregnancy, neurological abnormalities in newborn babies. Vitamin B12 can be detected in serum down to 3.0 nmol·L-1 by a simple intensity-based optical readout, consuming only 200 μL of a sample, which qualifies as easy miniaturization for point-of-care diagnostics. Additionally, this label-free approach can be used for long-term monitoring because of the high photostability of the upconversion nanoparticles. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "The instability of chromosome fragile sites is implicated as a causative factor in several human diseases, including cancer [for common fragile sites (CFSs)] and neurological disorders [for rare fragile sites (RFSs)]. Previous studies have indicated that problems arising during DNA replication are the underlying source of this instability. Although the role of replication stress in promoting instability at CFSs is well documented, much less is known about how the fragility of RFSs arises. Many RFSs, as exemplified by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat sequence in the fragile X syndrome-associated FRAXA locus, exhibit fragility in response to folate deficiency or other forms of “folate stress.” We hypothesized that such folate stress, through disturbing the replication program within the pathologically expanded repeats within FRAXA, would lead to mitotic abnormalities that exacerbate locus instability. Here, we show that folate stress leads to a dramatic increase in missegregation of FRAXA coupled with the formation of single-stranded DNA bridges in anaphase and micronuclei that contain the FRAXA locus. Moreover, chromosome X aneuploidy is seen when these cells are exposed to folate deficiency for an extended period. We propose that problematic FRAXA replication during interphase leads to a failure to disjoin the sister chromatids during anaphase.

    "Abstract": "Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is an oncolytic picornavirus with selective tropism for neuroendocrine cancers. SVV mediates cell entry by attachment to the receptor anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1). Here we determine atomic structures of mature SVV particles alone and in complex with ANTXR1 in both neutral and acidic conditions, as well as empty “spent” particles in complex with ANTXR1 in acidic conditions by cryoelectron microscopy. SVV engages ANTXR1 mainly by the VP2 DF and VP1 CD loops, leading to structural changes in the VP1 GH loop and VP3 GH loop, which attenuate interprotomer interactions and destabilize the capsid assembly. Despite lying on the edge of the attachment site, VP2 D146 interacts with the metal ion in ANTXR1 and is required for cell entry. Though the individual substitution of most interacting residues abolishes receptor binding and virus propagation, a serine-to-alanine mutation at VP2 S177 significantly increases SVV proliferation. Acidification of the SVV–ANTXR1 complex results in a major reconfiguration of the pentameric capsid assemblies, which rotate ∼20° around the icosahedral fivefold axes to form a previously uncharacterized spent particle resembling a potential uncoating intermediate with remarkable perforations at both two- and threefold axes. These structures provide high-resolution snapshots of SVV entry, highlighting opportunities for anticancer therapeutic optimization. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Despite extensive knowledge on the mechanisms that drive single-cell migration, those governing the migration of cell clusters, as occurring during embryonic development and cancer metastasis, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the collective migration of cell on adhesive gels with variable rigidity, using 3D cellular aggregates as a model system. After initial adhesion to the substrate, aggregates spread by expanding outward a cell monolayer, whose dynamics is optimal in a narrow range of rigidities. Fast expansion gives rise to the accumulation of mechanical tension that leads to the rupture of cell–cell contacts and the nucleation of holes within the monolayer, which becomes unstable and undergoes dewetting like a liquid film. This leads to a symmetry breaking and causes the entire aggregate to move as a single entity. Varying the substrate rigidity modulates the extent of dewetting and induces different modes of aggregate motion: “giant keratocytes,” where the lamellipo-dium is a cell monolayer that expands at the front and retracts at the back; “penguins,” characterized by bipedal locomotion; and “running spheroids,” for nonspreading aggregates. We characterize these diverse modes of collective migration by quantifying the flows and forces that drive them, and we unveil the fundamental physical principles that govern these behaviors, which underscore the biological predisposition of living material to migrate, independent of length scale. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

    "Abstract": "Research efforts are placing an ever increasing emphasis on identifying signal transduction pathways related to the chemopreventive activity of curcumin. Its anticarcinogenic effects are presumably mediated by the regulation of signaling cascades, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), activator protein 1 (AP-1), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). By modulating signal transduction pathways, curcumin induces apoptosis in malignant cells, thus inhibiting cancer development and progression. Due to the lack of mechanistic insight in the scientific literature, we developed a novel inverse molecular docking protocol based on the CANDOCK algorithm. For the first time, we performed inverse molecular docking of curcumin into a collection of 13,553 available human protein structures from the Protein Data Bank resulting in prioritized target proteins of curcumin. Our predictions were in agreement with the scientific literature and confirmed that curcumin binds to folate receptor β, DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A, metalloproteinase-2, mitogen-activated protein kinase 9, epidermal growth factor receptor and apoptosis-inducing factor 1. We also identified new potential protein targets of curcumin, namely deoxycytidine kinase, NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 and -2, ecto-50-nucleotidase, core histone macro-H2A.1, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11, macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, GTPase HRas, aflatoxin B1 aldehyde reductase member 3, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3, amiloride-sensitive amine oxidase, death-associated protein kinase 2 and tryptophan-tRNA ligase, that may all play a crucial role in its observed anticancer effects. Moreover, our inverse docking results showed that curcumin potentially binds also to the proteins cAMP-specific 30,50-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D and 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10, which provides a new explanation for its efficiency in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. We firmly believe that our computational results will complement and direct future experimental studies on curcumin’s anticancer activity as well as on its therapeutic effects against Alzheimer’s disease. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chromosome translocations are a hallmark of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Additional genomic aberrations are also crucial in both BCP-ALL leukemogenesis and treatment management. Herein, we report the phenotypic and molecular cytogenetic characterization of an extremely rare case of BCP-ALL harboring two concomitant leukemia-associated chromosome translocations: t(1;19)(q23;q13.3) and t(9;17)(p13;q11.2). Of note, we described a new rearrangement between exon 6 of PAX5 and a 17q11.2 region, where intron 3 of SPECC1 is located. This rearrangement seems to disrupt PAX5 similarly to a PAX5 deletion. Furthermore, a distinct karyotype between diagnosis and relapse samples was observed, disclosing a complex clonal evolution during leukemia progression. Case presentation: A 16-year-old boy was admitted febrile with abdominal and joint pain. At clinical investigation, he presented with anemia, splenomegaly, low white blood cell count and 92% lymphoblast. He was diagnosed with pre-B ALL and treated according to high risk GBTLI-ALL2009. Twelve months after complete remission, he developed a relapse in consequence of a high central nervous system and bone marrow infiltration, and unfortunately died. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a rearrangement between PAX5 and SPECC1. The presence of TCF3-PBX1 and PAX5-rearrangement at diagnosis and relapse indicates that both might have participated in the malignant transformation disease maintenance and dismal outcome. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Obesity is associated with oxidative stress, a major factor in carcinogenesis, and with high leptin concentration. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of leptin on the antioxidant response in three human mammary epithelial cells each presenting a different neoplastic status: healthy human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), oestrogen-receptor positive MCF-7 cells and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Methods: This in vitro kinetic study characterized the cell antioxidant response after 1, 6 and 24 h in the presence of leptin (10 or 100 ng/ml).The antioxidant response was defined in terms of cell glutathione content, gene expression and catalytic activity of antioxidant enzymes (i.e. glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S transferase (GST), heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)). Oxidative stress occurrence was assessed by lipid hydro peroxide (HPLIP) and isoprostane concentrations in culture media at 24 h. Results: At both concentrations used, leptin induced ROS production in all cell models, contributing to various antioxidant responses linked to neoplastic cell status. HMEC developed a highly inducible antioxidant response based on antioxidant enzyme activation and an increase in cell GSH content at 10 ng/ml of leptin. However, at 100 ng/ml of leptin, activation of antioxidant response was lower. Conversely, in tumour cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, leptin did not induce an efficient antioxidant response, at either concentration, resulting in an increase of lipid peroxidation products. Conclusions: Leptin can modulate the oxidative status of mammary epithelial cells differently according to their neoplastic state. These novel results shed light on oxidative status changes in mammary cells in the presence of leptin. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we constructed a new and sensitive ITO based electrochemical immunosensor for detection of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), a cancer biomarker found in serum and saliva. 6-phosphonohexanoic acid (PHA) was used as a biomolecule immobilization matrix for the first time. Anti-IL-1β antibody was utilized as a biorecognition molecule that immobilized onto carboxyl groups of 6-phosphohexanoic acid (PHA) via amide bond. Selective interaction between anti- IL-1β antibodies and IL-1β antigens was investigated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Single Frequency Impedance (SFI) methods. The surface characterization of the immunosensor was performed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), SEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in order to illustrate individual steps of biosensor construction. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the change in impedance was proportional to IL-1β concentrations in the range of 0.025–3 pg/mL (R2 = 0.99) with detection limit of 7.5 fg/mL. The reproducibility, repeatability, stability, and specificity of the developed immunosensor were analyzed. In addition, the developed immunosensor was successfully utilized for the determination of IL-1β in serum and saliva samples by using the standard addition method with recoveries of 96.7–105.4%. This immunosensor was applicable for the requirements of routine analysis with respect to performance, functionality and cost. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "AIM To compare the efficacy of combined spinal and epidural anesthesia vs epidural anesthesia in total hysterectomy and the impact on the serum motilin and gastrin. METHODS Ninety-two patients who underwent total hysterectomy at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from September 2015 to January 2016 were selected and randomly divided into two groups to receiver either combined spinal and epidural anesthesia or epidural anesthesia alone, with 46 cases in each groups. The two groups of patients were compared for intraoperative parameters, serum motilin and gastrin, patients' heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and awakening time, and intraoperative complications. RESULTS Time to successful induction of anesthesia was significantly shorter and use of anesthetics was significantly less in the combination group than in the epidural anesthesia alone group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in operative time between the two groups (P > 0.05). Before anesthesia, serum motilin showed no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05); after anesthesia, the combination group had a more obvious decrease (P < 0.05). Serum motilin exhibited a transient increase intraoperatively, but declined at day 1 postoperatively in both groups; the decrease was more significant in the combination group (P < 0.05). Serum gastrin showed no obvious change throughout the process in both groups, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at all time points (P > 0.05). After anesthesia, the combination group was superior to the epidural anesthesia alone group with regard to heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and awaking time, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The incidence of complications (6.52%) was significantly lower in the combination group than in the epidural anesthesia alone group (19.57%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Combined spinal and epidural anesthesia for total hysterectomy is safer and more effective and has fewer complications than epidural anesthesia alone. However, serum motilin and gastrin levels are unstable in both groups, and reducing perioperative surgical stress will have a positive impact on serum motilin and gastrin levels. © The Author(s) 2018.

    "Abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is anunusual disease resulting from autoantibodies (inhibitors) against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and clinically manifests as bleeding, which sometimes can cause potentially limb-threatening or life-threatening situations. AHA is associated with cancers, auto-immune disorders, infections, dermatologic conditions and certain medications, among which it is commonly secondary to multiple rheumatologic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pollymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. In autoimmune diseases, it may be the result of autoantibody producing against FVIII, and some cases of AHA may act as the first manifestation of SLE. AHA should be suspected in patients who have spontaneously hemorrhagic events with an isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), reduced FVIII activity and a negative lupus anticoagulant (LA). When FVIII inhibitor is found, it can be diagnosed. The management of AHA focuses on the following goals: (1) controlling and preventing bleeding, (2) eradication of the inhibitor, (3) treatment of the underlying disease. Here, a case of AHA in a patient with lupus is reported. A 53-year-old man with a 4-year history of SLE developed arthralgia and ecchymotic skin lesions after arthrocentesis of knee joint. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of an intramuscular hematoma. Coagulation tests revealed that FVIII activity reduced to 1% and a prolonged APTT (92.2 s), FVIII inhibitors were found to be as high as 60.0 Bethesda Units. Initial treatments with methylprednisolone 200 mg/d were started but new hemorrhagic manifestation occurred and hisbiological indexes were not good. Then the patient was treated with intravenous pulse corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 500 mg/d), intravenous cyclophosphamide, and also plasma and prothrombin complex infusion. Subsequently, FVIII activity returned within normal ranges, FVIII inhibitors decreased and clinical improvement was significantly obtained. The patient's condition kept stable till now.Hemorrhagic events due to production of antibodies directed against coagulation factors were rarely observed in SLE and attentions should be paid to the association between SLE and AHA.Bypass treatment was considered as the immediate antihemorrhagic treatment. Corticosteroid combined with immunosuppressor was recommended as the main therapy to eradicate the inhibitors. However we still lack the therapeutic guidelines and standardized treatment in patients of AHA with SLE at present.",

    "Abstract": "Protein kinases undergo large-scale structural changes that tightly regulate function and control recognition by small-molecule inhibitors. Methods for quantifying the conformational effects of inhibitors and linking them to an understanding of selectivity patterns have long been elusive. We have developed an ultrafast time-resolved fluorescence methodology that tracks structural movements of the kinase activation loop in solution with angstrom-level precision, and can resolve multiple structural states and quantify conformational shifts between states. Profiling a panel of clinically relevant Aurora kinase inhibitors against the mitotic kinase Aurora A revealed a wide range of conformational preferences, with all inhibitors promoting either the active DFG-in state or the inactive DFG-out state, but to widely differing extents. Remarkably, these conformational preferences explain broad patterns of inhibitor selectivity across different activation states of Aurora A, with DFG-out inhibitors preferentially binding Aurora A activated by phosphorylation on the activation loop, which dynamically samples the DFG-out state, and DFG-in inhibitors binding preferentially to Aurora A constrained in the DFG-in state by its allosteric activator Tpx2. The results suggest that many inhibitors currently in clinical development may be capable of differentiating between Aurora A signaling pathways implicated in normal mitotic control and in melanoma, neuroblastoma, and prostate cancer. The technology is applicable to a wide range of clinically important kinases and could provide a wealth of valuable structure–activity information for the development of inhibitors that exploit differences in conformational dynamics to achieve enhanced selectivity. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with malignant tumor. METHODS: Retrospective summary was made of 1 562 in patients of RA from January 2011 to June 2017. In the study, 74 RA patients with malignant tumor were reviewed and analyzed, and the general conditions, tumor types, RA and tumor onset sequence, and the medication situation were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of malignant tumor in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis in our center was 4.16%. The 74 patients were complicated with malignant tumor, of whom 53 were female, and 21 male. The age of RA at presentation was (52.6±17.8) years. The average disease duration of malignant tumor was (63.4 ± 12.7) years. The onset time of rheumatoid arthritis was earlier than that of malignant tumors in 51 cases (51/74), with an average of (17.2±14.2) years between 2 and 60 years. The incidence of malignant tumor was earlier than that of rheumatoid arthritis in 16 cases (16/74), with an average of (6.2±5.9) years between 1 and 21 years, of which 10 cases were sex hormone related tumors. Seven cases (7/74) were diagnosed with RA at the same time, and the time interval between the two diseases was within 1 year. All the patients were over 60 years old with digestive tract tumors. All the 7 patients showed polyarthritis, significantly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, including 4 rheumatoid factor positive cases and 2 anti-CCP antibody positive cases. The effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and traditional drugs to improve the condition of the disease was poor in the 7 patients, and the condition was relieved after using low-dose glucocorticoids. Gastrointestinal tumors, breast and reproductive system tumors were the most common, followed by respiratory, urological and blood system tumors. CONCLUSION: The risk in patients of rheumatoid arthritis complicated with malignant tumor is higher than that of the general population. A variety of factors play an important role in cancer risk of RA, including disease activity, some estrogen metabolites, the use of drugs and so on. Therefore, all RA patients should be screened for malignant tumor during diagnosis, and malignant tumor surveillance is mandatory for all rheumatoid arthritis patients after diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: For patients who had hemipelvectomies involving the resection of a portion or the whole of the pubis, bony reconstruction was not recommended commonly. However, the soft tissue reconstruction of the lower abdominal wall may benefit these patients. The object of the study was to determine the clinical effect of lower abdominal wall reconstruction with LARS ligament after pubic tumor resection interms of patient-reported and objective outcome. METHODS: In this series, we reviewed twenty-five patients who underwent pubic tumor resection followed by reconstruction with LARS ligament between February 2012 and February 2018 retrospectively. We evaluated the clinical outcome and complication of this surgical treatment. The function outcome was evaluated according the musculoskeletal tumor society scores (MSTS) for all the patients at the end of the last follow-up. RESULTS: All the patients were stable during the surgery. There were eight patients who underwent resection of superior ramus of pubis, five patients who had resection of inferior ramus of pubis, and twelve patients who received both superior and inferior ramus of pubis. For all the patients, the mean blood loss was (774±580) mL. The mean operation time was (138±25) min. The mean hospital stay was (19±6) d. For the patients who had resection of superior ramus, inferior ramus, as well as both superior and inferior ramus, the mean blood loss were (763±802) mL, (730±315) mL and (808±485) mL, respectively. The mean operation time were (133±27) min, (135±35) min and (143±20) min, respectively. The mean hospital stay were (18±5) d, (22±9) d and (19±6) d, respectively. The mean follow-up time was (37±21) months. Local recurrence was observed in one patient with chondrosarcoma. One patient with renal cancer metastasis died of the disease. No ligament infection, ligament related complication and incisional hernias were observed. Twenty-three patients could ambulate without assistive devices, and the remaining two could walk by crutches. Postoperative pain was reported as none in nineteen patients, mild in three, and moderate in three. From a functional point, the mean MSTS score was 87±4. CONCLUSION: Lower abdominal wall reconstruction with LARS ligament after pubic tumor resection could have satisfactory clinical outcome. It could prevent the occurrence of herniation, decrease the infection rate by minishing the dead space, and achieve good patient-reported outcome.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the incidence and risk factors for the acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after resection of esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 422 consecutive patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine with esophageal carcinoma undergoing esophagectomy from January 2010 to December 2016 in Peking University Cancer Hospital. ALI/ARDS were diagnosed, the patients were divided into ALI/ARDS group and control group without ALI/ARDS, the differences of clinical features were contrasted between the two groups, and the multivariate Logistic regression modeling was used to identify the independent risk factors for ALI/ARDS. RESULTS: In the study, 41 ALI/ARDS cases were diagnosed, making up 9.7% (41/422) of all the enrolled patients undergoing esophagectomy. Comparisons of the ALI/ARDS group and the control group indicated significant statistical differences in the average length of their hospital stay [(18.9±9.7) d vs. (14.8±3.6) d, P=0.011], the proportion of the patients who needed mechanical ventilation support [51.2% (21/41) vs. 9.4% (36/381), P<0.001] and in-hospital mortality [31.7% (13/41) vs. 5.0% (19/381), P<0.001]. Univariate analysis showed significant differences between the patients with ALI/ARDS and without ALI/ARDS in smoking history (P=0.064), preoperative forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) (P=0.020), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (P=0.011), body weight index (BMI) (P=0.044), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (P=0.049) and one lung ventilation duration (P=0.008), while multivariate Logistic regression analysis indicated that preoperative FEV1/FVC (OR=1.053, P=0.016, 95%CI 1.010-1.098), ASA physical status classification (OR=2.392, P=0.033, 95%CI 1.073-5.335) and one lung ventilation duration (OR=0.994, P=0.028, 95%CI 0.989-0.999) were the independent risk factors for ALI/ARDS after esophagectomy. CONCLUSION: ALI/ARDS was a serious complication in patients undergoing esophagectomy associated with increment in length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis indicated that preoperative FEV1/FVC, ASA classification and one lung ventilation duration were the independent risk factors for ALI/ARDS after esophagectomy. Carefully assessing the patient before operation, shortening one lung ventilation duration were the key points in preventing ALI/ARDS after esophagectomy.",

    "Abstract": "Conspectus Alkynylplatinum(II) terpyridine complexes have been increasingly explored since the previous decades, mainly arising from their intriguing photophysical properties and aggregation affinities associated with their extensive Pt(II)⋯Pt(II) and π-π stacking interactions. Through molecular engineering, one can modulate their fundamental properties and assembly behavior by introduction of various functional groups and structural features. They can therefore serve as ideal candidates to construct metal complex-based molecular architectures to provide an alternative to organic compounds. The metal-based framework can be simultaneously built from predetermined building blocks, giving rise to their well-defined, unique, and discrete natures for molecular recognition. The individual constituents can contribute to molecular architectures with their integrated properties, allowing the manipulation of the various noncovalent intermolecular forces and interactions for selective guest capture. In this Account, our recent progress in the development of these metallomolecular frameworks based on the alkynylplatinum(II) terpyridine system and their recognition properties toward different guest molecules will be presented.Phosphorescent molecular tweezers have been constructed from the alkynylplatinum(II) terpyridine moiety to demonstrate host-guest interactions with cationic, charge-neutral and anionic platinum(II), palladium(II), gold(I), and gold(III) complexes and their binding affinities were found to be perturbed by different metal⋯metal, π-π and electrostatic interactions. The host-guest assembly process has also resulted in dramatic color changes, together with the turning on of near-IR (NIR) emissions as a result of extensive Pt(II)⋯Pt(II) interactions. Further work has also been performed to demonstrate that the tweezers can selectively recognize π-surfaces of different planar π-conjugated organic guests. The framework of molecular tweezers has been extended to a double-decker tweezers structure, or a triple-decker structure, which can bind two equivalents of square-planar platinum(II) guests cooperatively to induce a significant color change in solution, representing rare examples of discrete Magnus' green-like salts.By the approaches of structural modifications, we have further modulated the host architecture from molecular tweezers to molecular rectangles. The rectangles have been found to show selective encapsulation of different transition metal complex guests based on the size and steric environment of the host cavity. The molecular rectangles also exhibit reversible host-guest association, in which guest capture and ejection processes can be manipulated by the pH environment, illustrating a potential approach for precise and smart delivery of therapeutic reagents to the slightly more acidic cancer cells. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin may negatively affect long-term brain functioning in cancer survivors; neuroinflammation may play a causal role. Dietary approaches that reduce inflammation, such as lowering sucrose and increasing eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (EPA + DHA), may attenuate chemotherapy-induced neuroinflammation and synaptic damage, thereby improving quality of life. Ovariectomized, C57BL/6 mice were assigned to a chemotherapy (9 mg/kg doxorubicin + 90 mg/kg cyclophosphamide) or vehicle two-injection regimen, with injections two and four weeks after starting diets. In Study 1, mice received low sucrose diets with EPA + DHA or No EPA + DHA for four to six weeks; tissues were collected four, seven, or 14 days after the second injection. Compared to vehicle, chemotherapy increased pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β at day seven in the cortex and hippocampus, and reduced gene expression of synaptic marker Shank 3 at all timepoints in cortex, while EPA + DHA increased expression of Shank 3. In Study 2, high or low sucrose/EPA + DHA or No EPA + DHA diets were fed for five weeks; tissues were collected ten days after the second injection. Among chemotherapy-treated mice, brain DHA was higher with low sucrose feeding. Furthermore, low sucrose increased gene expression of Shank 1, while EPA + DHA increased expression of Shank 3 and reduced protein concentrations of pro-inflammatory markers IL-5, IL-6 and KC/GRO in the cortex, but not the hippocampus. Low sucrose, EPA + DHA diets may attenuate neuroinflammation and synaptic damage induced by doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in specific brain regions. © 2018 by the authors.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the work is to present the epidemiological situation in the field of occupational diseases in Poland in 2016. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cases of occupational diseases identified in accordance with the applicable case law system in Poland and reported to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases in 2016 were analyzed. The analysis includes nosologic units, their causative factors as well as gender and age of patients. Absolute numbers and incidence rates per 100 000 employees were presented. RESULTS: In 2016, 2119 cases of occupational diseases were recorded in Poland, i.e. 14.3 cases per 100 000 employed persons. The incidence rate was mainly caused by pneumoconioses (28.5%), infectious or parasitic diseases (27.2%), chronic voice disorders (9.7%), chronic diseases of the peripheral nervous system (8.6%) and hearing loss (6.3%). The highest incidence was recorded in the mining and quarrying (329.7 cases), agriculture and forestry (23.8 cases), manufacturing (20 cases) and education (17.9 cases) and healthcare and social work activities (17.7 cases). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with 2015, there was an increase in the number of cases of occupational diseases by 1.2%, which was influenced mainly by a larger (by 181 cases) number of pneumoconiosis. The epidemiological situation resulting from occupational diseases in our country, although it covers all identified cases, should be assessed with caution because the suspicion arises underestimation of certain diseases, especially cancer.

MATERIAŁ I METODY: Przeanalizowano przypadki chorób zawodowych stwierdzonych zgodnie z obowiązującym w Polsce systemem orzeczniczym i obligatoryjnie zgłaszanych do centralnego Rejestru Chorób Zawodowych w 2016 r. W przeglądzie uwzględniono m.in. jednostki chorobowe, ich przyczyny, a także płeć i wiek chorych. Przedstawiono liczby bezwzględne i współczynniki zapadalności na 100 tys. pracujących. WYNIKI: W 2016 r. stwierdzono w Polsce 2119 przypadków chorób zawodowych, tj. 14,3 przypadków na 100 tys. pracujących. Zachorowalność ogólną kształtowały głównie pylice płuc (28,5%), choroby zakaźne lub pasożytnicze (27,2%), przewlekłe choroby narządu głosu (9,7%), przewlekłe choroby obwodowego układu nerwowego (8,6%) i ubytek słuchu (6,3%). Najwyższą zapadalność na 100 tys. pracujących odnotowano w górnictwie (329,7 przypadków), rolnictwie i leśnictwie (21,9 przypadków), przetwórstwie przemysłowym (20 przypadków), edukacji (17,9 przypadków) oraz opiece zdrowotnej i pomocy społecznej (17,7 przypadków). WNIOSKI: W porównaniu z rokiem 2015 nastąpił wzrost liczby przypadków chorób zawodowych o 1,2%, na co wpłynęła głównie większa – o 181 przypadków – liczba pylic płuc. Sytuacja epidemiologiczna wynikająca z zapadalności na choroby zawodowe w naszym kraju, chociaż obejmuje wszystkie stwierdzone przypadki, powinna być oceniana ostrożnie, gdyż nasuwa podejrzenie niedoszacowania niektórych chorób, szczególnie nowotworów.

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics and prognostic information of estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-negative (ER+/PR-) male breast cancer. Methods: Using the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we compared the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcome of estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) patients with ER+/PR- male breast cancer patients from 1990 to 2010. Two thousand three hundred twenty-two patients with ER+/PR+ tumors and 355 patients with ER+/PR- tumors were included in our study. Results: ER+/PR- patients were younger (P = 0.008) and more likely to be African American (P < 0.001) while presented with higher histological grade (P < 0.001), larger tumor size (P = 0.010), and more invasion to the lymph nodes (P = 0.034) and distant sites (P < 0.001), thus later stage (P = 0.001). Despite higher chance of receiving chemotherapy (51.0% vs 36.5%, P < 0.001), ER+/PR- patients experienced significantly worse breast cancer-specific survival (BSCC) (P < 0.001) and shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.003). Multivariate Cox model confirmed that tumor size, lymph node invasion, metastasis, and surgery were independent prognostic factors of both BSCC and OS for ER+/PR- male breast cancer. Age at diagnosis and chemotherapy were significantly associated with OS but not with BSCC. Conclusion: ER+/PR- male breast cancer was more aggressive and experienced shorter survival than ER+/PR+ patients. The prognosis was mainly associated with tumor size, lymph node invasion, metastasis, and surgery. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Exhibiting high consistence in sequence and structure, S100 family members are interchangeable in function and they show a wide spectrum of biological processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, inflammation and differentiation and the like. While the prognostic value of each individual S100 in ovarian cancer is still elusive. In current study, we investigated the prognostic value of S100 family members in the ovarian cancer. Methods: We used the Kaplan Meier plotter (KM plotter) database, in which updated gene expression data and survival information are from 1657 ovarian cancer patients, to assess the relevance of individual S100 family mRNA expression to overall survival in various ovarian cancer subtypes and different clinicopathological features. Results: It was found that high expression of S100A2 (HR = 1.18, 95%CI: 1.04-1.34, P = 0.012), S100A7A (HR = 1.3, 95%CI: 1.04-1.63, P = 0.02),S100A10 (HR = 1.2, 95%CI: 1.05-1.38, P = 0.0087),and S100A16 (HR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1-1.51, P = 0.052) were significantly correlated with worse OS in all ovarian cancer patients, while the expression of S100A1 (HR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.77-0.99, P = 0.039), S100A3 (HR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.71-0.96, P = 0.0011), S100A5 (HR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.73-0.97, P = 0.017), S100A6 (HR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.72-0.98, P = 0.024), S100A13 (HR = 0.85, 95%CI:0.75-0.97, P = 0.014) and S100G (HR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.74-0.99, P = 0.041) were associated with better prognosis. Furthermore, we assessed the prognostic value of S100 expression in different subtypes and the clinicopathological features, including pathological grades, clinical stages and TP53 mutation status, of ovarian cancer patients. Conclusion: Comprehensive understanding of the S100 family members may have guiding significance for the diagnosis and outcome of ovarian cancer patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the cancer immune landscape and their potential as treatment targets or modulators of response to treatment are gaining increasing interest. TAMs display high molecular and functional complexity. Therefore their objective assessment as breast cancer biomarkers is critical. The aims of this study were to objectively determine the in situ expression and significance of TAM biomarkers (CD68, CD163, and MMP-9) in breast cancer and to identify subclasses of patients who could benefit from TAM-targeting therapies. Methods: We measured CD68, CD163, and MMP-9 protein expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of breast carcinomas represented in tissue microarray format using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) in two independent Yale cohorts: cohort A - n = 398, estrogen receptor-positive (ER + ) and ER - cases - and the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-only cohort B (n = 160). Associations between macrophage markers, ER status, and survival were assessed. Protein expression measured by QIF was compared with mRNA expression data from the METABRIC study. Results: All three macrophage markers were co-expressed, displaying higher expression in ER - cancers. High pan-macrophage marker CD68 correlated with poorer overall survival (OS) only in ER - cases of cohort A (P = 0.02). High expression of CD163 protein in TAMs was associated with improved OS in ER - cases (cohort A, P = 0.03 and TNBC cohort B, P = 0.04, respectively) but not in ER + cancers. MMP-9 protein was not individually associated with OS. High expression of MMP-9 in the CD68 + /CD163 + TAMs was associated with worse OS in ER + tumors (P &lt;0.001) but not in ER - cancers. In the METABRIC dataset, mRNA levels followed the co-expression pattern observed in QIF but did not always show the same trend regarding OS. Conclusions: Macrophage activity markers correlate with survival differently in ER + and ER - cancers. The association between high co-expression and co-localization of MMP-9/CD163/CD68 and poor survival in ER + cancers suggests that these cancers may be candidates for macrophage-targeted therapies. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study investigated the prognostic effects of venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related factors in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy. Predictive factors for VTE were also investigated. Methods: A total of 216 patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer who received gemcitabine-based palliative chemotherapy at our institution were retrospectively evaluated. Results: VTE occurred in 51 (23.6%) patients during treatment and did not affect survival. However, patients who were diagnosed with VTE at the beginning of chemotherapy showed poor prognosis compared with patients diagnosed with VTE during chemotherapy: all patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.897, p = 0.008); patients diagnosed with VTE (HR = 3.768, p = 0.001). Low serum sodium (Na) (< 135 mmol/L) and high Khorana score (≥3) were strong predictive factors of early VTE (odds ratio [OR] 5.109; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.010-25.845; p = 0.049 for Khorana score, OR 10.304; 95% CI = 1.036-102.466; p = 0.047) for hyponatremia). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that occurrence and detection of VTE in the early period of chemotherapy was the most significant VTE-related prognostic factor in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy. Prediction using the Khorana score and serum Na levels would be helpful in early diagnosis of VTE. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Overdiagnosis, defined as the detection of a cancer that would not become clinically apparent in a woman's lifetime without screening, has become a growing concern. Similar underlying risk of breast cancer in the screened and control groups is a prerequisite for unbiased estimates of overdiagnosis, but a contemporary control group is usually not available in organized screening programs. Methods: We estimated the frequency of overdiagnosis of breast cancer due to screening in women 50-69 years old by using individual screening data from the population-based organized screening program in Stockholm County 1989-2014. A hidden Markov model with four latent states and three observed states was constructed to estimate the natural progression of breast cancer and the test sensitivity. Piecewise transition rates were used to consider the time-varying transition rates. The expected number of detected non-progressive breast cancer cases was calculated. Results: During the study period, 2,333,153 invitations were sent out; on average, the participation rate in the screening program was 72.7% and the average recall rate was 2.48%. In total, 14,648 invasive breast cancer cases were diagnosed; among the 8305 screen-detected cases, the expected number of non-progressive breast cancer cases was 35.9, which is equivalent to 0.43% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10%-2.2%) overdiagnosis. The corresponding estimates for the prevalent and subsequent rounds were 15.6 (0.87%, 95% CI 0.20%-4.3%) and 20.3 (0.31%, 95% CI 0.07%-1.6%), respectively. The likelihood ratio test showed that the non-homogeneous model fitted the data better than an age-homogeneous model (P <0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that overdiagnosis in the organized biennial mammographic screening for women 50-69 in Stockholm County is a minor phenomenon. The frequency of overdiagnosis in the prevalent screening round was higher than that in subsequent rounds. The non-homogeneous model performed better than the simpler, traditional homogeneous model. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Finding a cancer-selective drug that avoids damaging healthy cells and organs is a holy grail in medical research. In our previous studies, gold-coated iron (Fe@Au) nanoparticles showed cancer selective anti-cancer properties in vitro and in vivo but were found to gradually lose that activity with storage or \"ageing.\" To determine the reasons for this diminished anti-cancer activity, we examined Fe@Au nanoparticles at different preparation and storage stages by means of transmission electron microscopy combined with and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, along with X-ray diffraction analysis and cell viability tests. We found that dried and reconstituted Fe@Au nanoparticles, or Fe@Au nanoparticles within cells, decompose into irregular fragments of γ-F 2 O 3 and agglomerated gold clumps. These changes cause the loss of the particles' anti-cancer effects. However, we identified that the anti-cancer properties of Fe@Au nanoparticles can be well preserved under argon or, better still, liquid nitrogen storage for six months and at least one year, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is a deadly form of cancer with high morbidity and mortality rates. Deregulated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are frequently associated with the formation and development of lung carcinoma. Quercetin is a major dietary flavonoid that has been shown to induce cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in human lung cancer cell lines. In the current study, four major overexpressed RTKs–EGFR, FGFR1, IGF1R and c-Met–involved in human lung cancer were investigated. Molecular docking was employed to identify the binding orientation and inhibitory potential of quercetin in these RTKs. Quercetin bound to the ATP binding pocket of these kinases exhibited good binding scores and interactions by establishing hydrogen, hydrophobic and π-π interactions with the hinge region and the DFG motif in the activation loop. Thus, quercetin could be further explored as a platform for developing specific or polypharmacological compounds targeting overexpressed RTKs in lung cancer. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Salivary gland cancers are not sensitive to conventional radiotherapy or chemotherapy regimens. Therefore, the development of a new treatment strategy is of critical importance for improving the prognosis. We examined the expression of mesothelin molecules in salivary gland cancers and the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy based on mesothelin-specific chimeric antigen receptor transduced T cells. Methods: The expression of mesothelin molecule was studied in salivary gland cancer samples obtained from 16 patients as well as a salivary gland cancer cell line (A-253) and five other cell lines. The activation of mesothelin-specific chimeric antigen receptor-expressing CD8 T cells after stimulation with mesothelin and the effects of invariant natural killer T cells on this activation were evaluated. Results: Mesothelin was detected in the A-253 cells and the surgical specimens except for the case of squamous cell carcinoma to various degrees. Following stimulation with mesothelin expressing cancer cells, chimeric antigen receptor T cells were dose-dependently activated; this activation was enhanced by co-culture with invariant natural killer T cells and subsequently abrogated by treatment with anti-interferon-γ antibodies. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of chimeric antigen receptor T cells against various cancer cells was further augmented by invariant natural killer T cells. Conclusions: The use of adoptive transfer with mesothelin-specific chimeric antigen receptor-expressing CD8 T cells against salivary gland cancers is an effective therapy and invariant natural killer T cells are expected to be used in adjuvant treatment for T cell-based immunotherapy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) is associated with the clinical outcome of cancer treatment. For several cancers, countries with relatively good health care systems have favorable MIRs. However, the association between lung cancer MIR and health care expenditures or rankings has not been evaluated. We used linear regression to analyze the correlation between lung cancer MIRs and the total expenditures on health/gross domestic product (e/GDP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) rankings. We included 57 countries, for which data of adequate quality were available, and we found high rates of incidence and mortality but low MIRs in more developed regions. Among the continents, North America had the highest rates of incidence and mortality, whereas the highest MIRs were in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Globally, favorable MIRs correlated with high e/GDP and good WHO ranking (regression coefficient, −0.014 and 0.001; p = 0.004, and p = 0.014, respectively). In conclusion, the MIR for lung cancer in different countries varies with the expenditure on health care and health system rankings. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "Background: To investigate the potential prognostic role of pre-treatment prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in urinary cancers. Methods: Relevant articles were searched comprehensively from PubMed, Embase and Web of Science, up to November 2018. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted to evaluate their associations. Result: A total of 12 related articles including 6561 patients were ultimately enrolled. Our results indicated that a relatively lower level of pre-treatment PNI was associated with decreased OS, CSS/DSS and DFS/RFS/PFS (pooled HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.45-1.95; pooled HR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.33-1.86; pooled HR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.53-1.99, respectively). Subsequent stratified analysis by cancer type for OS showed that PNI could also be a predictor no matter in renal cell cancer (RCC) or bladder cancer (BC) (pooled HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.37-1.97 and pooled HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.33). Similar results could be found in DFS/RFS/PFS (RCC: HR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.54-2.13 and BC: HR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.32-2.12) and in CSS/DSS (RCC: HR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.23-1.82 and upper tract urothelial carcinoma: HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.13-2.28). As for the treatment subgroup, a relatively lower level of PNI could also be a positive predictor for OS (surgery: HR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.40-1.93; target therapy: HR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.34-2.63) and DFS/RFS/PFS (surgery: HR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.47-1.95; target therapy: HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.50-3.05). Conclusion: The outcomes of us shed light on that elevated pre-treatment PNI was positively associated with OS, CSS/DSS and DFS/RFS/PFS, indicating that it could be an independent prognostic factor in urinary cancers. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are associated with poor prognoses in patients with gastric cancer; however, few studies have focused on the dynamic changes in these ratios during the treatment of patients with gastric cancer. Here, we assessed the clinical utility of changes in these ratios as prognostic indicators in patients with stage II or III gastric cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 100 patients who received S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy at ≥70% of the relative dose intensity, and their NLRs and PLRs were evaluated at different times: prior to gastrectomy and upon commencement and termination of adjuvant chemotherapy. To assure the clinical utility of the changes in NLR and PLR as prognostic indicators, other clinical factors were assessed as well. Results: Disease recurred in 35 patients as follows: lymph node metastasis (17 patients, 17.0%), peritoneal metastasis (12 patients, 12.0%), and hematogenous metastasis (6 patients, 6.0%); 24 patients died. An increase in the NLR during adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 was identified as an independent indicator associated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 6.736, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.420-18.748; P < 0.001), and relapse-free survival (HR 5.309, 95% CI 2.585-10.901; P < 0.001). Conclusion: An increase in the NLR during S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy may be a useful prognostic indicator in patients with stage II or III gastric cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer chemoprevention can reduce breast cancer incidence in high-risk women; however, chemoprevention is underutilized in the primary care setting. We conducted a pilot study of decision support tools among high-risk women and their primary care providers (PCPs). Methods: The intervention included a decision aid (DA) for high-risk women, RealRisks, and a provider-centered tool, Breast Cancer Risk Navigation (BNAV). Patients completed validated surveys at baseline, after RealRisks and after their PCP clinical encounter or at 6-months. Referral for high-risk consultation and chemoprevention uptake were assessed via the electronic health record. The primary endpoint was accuracy of breast cancer risk perception at 6-months. Results: Among 40 evaluable high-risk women, median age was 64.5 years and median 5-year breast cancer risk was 2.19%. After exposure to RealRisks, patients demonstrated an improvement in accurate breast cancer risk perceptions (p = 0.02), an increase in chemoprevention knowledge (p < 0.01), and 24% expressed interest in taking chemoprevention. Three women had a high-risk referral, and no one initiated chemoprevention. Decisional conflict significantly increased from after exposure to RealRisks to after their clinical encounter or at 6-months (p < 0.01). Accurate breast cancer risk perceptions improved and was sustained at 6-months or after clinical encounters. We discuss the side effect profile of chemoprevention and the care pathway when RealRisks was introduced to understand why patients experienced increased decision conflict. Conclusion: Future interventions should carefully link the use of a DA more proximally to the clinical encounter, investigate timed measurements of decision conflict and improve risk communication, shared decision making, and chemoprevention education for PCPs. Additional work remains to better understand the impact of decision aids targeting both patients and providers.

    "Abstract": "Fibroblasts have significant involvement in cancer progression and are an important therapeutic target for cancer. Here, we present a microfluidic non-contact co-culture device to analyze interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts. Further, we investigate myofibroblast behaviors induced by lung tumor cells as responses to gallic acid and baicalein. Human lung fibroblast (HLF) and lung cancer cell line (A549) cells were introduced into neighboring, separated regions by well-controlled laminar flows. The phenotypic behavior and secretion activity of the tumor cells indicate that fibroblasts could become activated through paracrine signaling to create a supportive microenvironment for cancer cells when HLF is co-cultured with A549. Furthermore, both gallic acid (GA) and baicalein (BAE) could inhibit the activation of fibroblasts. In situ analysis of various cell communications via the paracrine pathway could be realizable in this contactless co-culture single device. This device facilitates a better understanding of interactions between heterotypic cells, thus exploring the mechanism of cancer, and performs anti-invasion drug assays in a relatively complex microenvironment. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Platinum drugs, including carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are commonly used chemotherapy drugs that kill cancer cells by forming toxic drug-DNA adducts. These drugs have a proven, but modest, efficacy against several aggressive subtypes of breast cancer but also cause several side effects that can lead to the cessation of treatment. There is a clinical need to identify patients who will respond to platinum drugs in order to better inform clinical decision making. Diagnostic microdosing involves dosing patients or patient samples with subtherapeutic doses of radiolabeled platinum followed by measurement of platinum-DNA adducts in blood or tumor tissue and may be used to predict patient response. We exposed a panel of six breast cancer cell lines to 14C-labeled carboplatin or oxaliplatin at therapeutic and microdose (1% therapeutic dose) concentrations for a range of exposure lengths and isolated DNA from the cells. The DNA was converted to graphite, and measurement of radiocarbon due to platinum-DNA adduction was quantified via accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). We observed a linear correlation in adduct levels between the microdose and therapeutic dose, and the level of platinum-DNA adducts corresponded to cell line drug sensitivity for both carboplatin and oxaliplatin. These results showed a clear separation in adduct levels between the sensitive and resistant groups of cell lines that could not be fully explained or predicted by changes in DNA repair rates or mutations in DNA repair genes. Further, we were able to quantitate oxaliplatin-DNA adducts in the blood and tumor tissue of a metastatic breast cancer patient. Together, these data support the use of diagnostic microdosing for predicting patient sensitivity to platinum. Future studies will be aimed at replicating this data in a clinical feasibility trial. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer threatened the health of millions of people around the world. Here we explored the influence of TCDD on the expression of circRNA_BARD1 (circ_0001098) in breast cancer and studied the potential molecular mechanism of circRNA_BARD1. The data from GSE76608 was applied to analyze differentially expressed circRNAs and mRNAs. The expressions of circRNA_BARD1, BARD1, miR-3942-3p, miR-4760-3p and apoptosis-related protein p53 were detected by qRT-PCR or western blot. Circinteractome, TargetScan, CIRCNET and dual luciferase reporter assay were employed to uncover the target relationship between circRNA_BARD1/BARD1 and miR-3942-3p/miR-4760-3p. Flow cytometric analysis was used to reveal cell cycle and cell apoptosis. Immunofluorescence was applied to determinate γ-H2AX level. Xenograft assay and in vivo 3-D imaging was implemented to further verify the conclusions in vitro. CircRNA_BARD1 (circ_0001098) was up-regulated in breast cancer with the treatment of TCDD and the up-regulation of circRNA_BARD1 could restrain cell proliferation, block cell cycle and promote cell apoptosis. Moreover, the target relationship between circRNA_BARD1/BARD1 and miR-3942-3p was confirmed. In addition, miR-3942-3p overexpression promoted the disease progression and BARD1 up-regulation inhibited the disease progression in the breast cancer. Similarly, circRNA_BARD1 overexpression induced by TCDD suppressed the growth and metastasis of tumor in vivo. In conclusion, TCDD induced circ_0001098 overexpression and then suppressed breast cancer tumorigenesis via miR-3942-3p/BARD1 axis. The finding of TCDD-circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis might bring a new perspective for cure strategy of breast cancer. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) comes in several forms, such as surgical castration or medical castration using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or GnRH antagonist therapy. ADT is a critical treatment for high-risk and metastatic prostate cancer. There are important differences between GnRH agonists and antagonists. Here we review the mechanism of action between GnRH agonists and antagonists and the studies that led to the approval of degarelix. We also comment on the potential risks and benefits of degarelix, particularly when it comes to cardiovascular health. Finally, we describe an oral GnRH antagonist, which is not currently used in prostate cancer, but is included for completeness.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The secretion of soluble factors enables communication between tumour cells and the surrounding microenvironment and plays an important role in oncogenesis. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterised by a highly reactive microenvironment, harbouring a variety of cell types, including S100A8/S100A9-expressing monocytes. S100A8/S100A9 proteins regulate the behaviour of cancer cells by inducing pre-metastatic cascades associated with cancer spread. The aim of this study was to examine how S100A8/A9 proteins mediate tumour-stroma crosstalk in PDAC. Methods: Cytokine profiling of pancreatic cancer cell-derived conditioned media was performed using Bio-Plex Pro 27 Plex Human Cytokine assays. Protein expression and activation of downstream signalling effectors and NF-κB were assessed by western blotting analysis and reporter assays respectively. Results: Stimulation of cultured pancreatic cancer cells with S100A8 and S100A9 increased the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, TNF-α, and FGF. S100A8, but not S100A9 induced PDGF secretion. Conversely, pancreatic cancer cell-derived conditioned media and the individual cytokines, TNF-α and TGF-β induced the expression of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins in the HL-60 monocytic cell line and primary human monocytes, while FGF and IL-8 induced the expression of S100A9 only. S100A8 and S100A9 activated MAPK and NF-κB signalling in pancreatic cancer. This was partially mediated via activation of the receptor of advanced glycosylation end-product (RAGE). Conclusion: S100A8 and S100A9 proteins induce specific cytokine secretion from PDAC cells, which in turn enhances the expression of S100A8/A9. This paracrine crosstalk could have implications for PDAC invasiveness and metastatic potential. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to look specifically at the intersection between behavioral health and immigration stigma. Design/methodology/approach: In April of 2017, 256 US participants answered an online solicitation on MTurk to answer questions regarding perceptions of others. Participants were randomized to one of four vignettes which had conditions representing diagnosis (drug abuse vs brain cancer) and immigration status (naturalized citizen vs undocumented immigrant). Findings: Drug abuse was significantly disdained and blamed more than brain cancer. A main effect was also found for immigration status for disdain. Interaction between diagnosis and immigration status was significant for blame, but undocumented status increased the blame of students with brain cancer, the opposite condition the authors expected. Originality/value: The study validated previously tested hypotheses, namely, people with behavioral health challenges are highly stigmatized being disdained and blamed for their conditions more than people with brain cancer. The study tested intersectionality by examining the hypothesis that undocumented immigration status worsens stigmatizing views of people with behavioral health conditions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is the second leading cause of male cancer-related death in North America. Metabolic adaptations in malignant PC cells play a key role in fueling the growth and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding these changes in cellular metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, is mechanically linked to altered metabolism and progression in PC. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we silenced the gene for CENPF in human PC3 cells. These cells were found to have reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of CENPF also simultaneously improved sensitivity to anoikis-induced apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from CENPF knockout (CENPF KO ) and control cells revealed that CENPF silencing increased inactive forms of pyruvate kinase M2, a rate limiting enzyme needed for an irreversible reaction in glycolysis. Furthermore, CENPF KO cells had reduced global bio-energetic capacity, acetyl-CoA production, histone acetylation, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that CENPF is a critical regulator of cancer metabolism, potentially through its effects on mitochondrial functioning. Additional quantitative immunohistochemistry and imaging analyzes on a series of PC tumor microarrays demonstrated that CENPF expression is significantly increased in higher-risk PC patients. Based on these findings, we suggest the CENPF may be an important regulator of PC metabolism through its role in the mitochondria. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Epigenetic modifications in host cells, like p16 ink4a methylation, have been considered as putative complementary mechanisms for cancer development. Because only a small proportion of infected women develop cervical cancer, other factors might be involved in carcinogenesis, either independently or in association with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infections, including epigenetic factors. OBJECTIVES We hypothesised that p16 ink4a methylation might have a role in cancer development driven by HPV16, mainly in the presence of intact E1/E2 genes. Thus, our objectives were to assess the status of p16 ink4a methylation and the HPV16 E1/E2 integrity in samples in different stages of cervical diseases. METHODS Presence of HPV16 was determined by E6 type-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methylation status of the p16 ink4a promoter was assessed by methylation-specific PCR in 87 cervical specimens comprising 29 low-grade (LSIL), 41 high-grade (HSIL) lesions, and 17 cervical cancers (CC). Characterisation of E1 and E2 disruption (as an indirect indicator of the presence of episomal viral DNA) was performed by PCR amplifications. FINDINGS We observed a significantly increased trend (nptrend = 0.0320) in the proportion of methylated p16 ink4a in cervical samples during cancer development. Concomitant E1 and E2 disruptions were the most frequent pattern found in all groups: CC (76%), HSIL (54%), and LSIL (73%). No statistically significant differences between p16 ink4a methylation and E1/E2 integrity, in histological groups, was observed. MAIN CONCLUSIONS There was an increase in methylation of the p16 ink4a promoter from pre-neoplastic lesions to cancer. Additionally, a high frequency of E1/E2 disruptions in LSIL/HSIL suggested that viral DNA integration was an early event in cervical disease. Moreover, the methylation status was apparently independent of HPV16 integrity.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Until recently, palliative care (PC) resources in Finland have been sparse. To meet the increasing need for PC an end-of-life (EOL) care project has been ongoing in South Western Finland since 2012, and in 2015, a weekday palliative outpatient clinic was established in Turku University Hospital (TUH). The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the project and the PC clinic on the management practices of EOL cancer patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) of TUH from 2013 to 2016. Methods: The medical records of all cancer patients (ICD-10 codes C00-97) admitted to the ED of TUH between August 1-December 31, in 2013 and 2016, were analyzed: n = 529, n = 432 respectively (2013 and 2016). The analysis focused on those patients in EOL care; n = 77, n = 63, respectively. The late palliative patients were defined by PC decision, thus termination of life-prolonging cancer-specific treatments. The EOL patients were in the imminently dying phase of their illness. The site of referral after an ED visit was also verified together with the documentation on advance care plans (ACP), and the impact of palliative outpatient visits. Results: In 2016, the number of late palliative and EOL patients admitted to the ED has shown a tendency to decrease. The quality of the documentation for treatment goals, do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, living wills and connections to primary care providers has improved since 2013. Prior visits to palliative outpatient clinic correlated well with the more comprehensive ACP information: i) DNR order (p = 0.0001); ii) connection to primary care (p = 0.003); iii) documented ICD-10 code Z51.5 (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Even modest investments in resources for PC can induce an objective change in the allocation of health care resources, and improve the ACP for the cancer patients at their EOL. A visit to a palliative outpatient clinic may offer one approach for improving the quality and completion of ACP documentation. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The solute carrier (SLC) 7 family genes comprise 14 members and function as cationic amino acid/glycoprotein transporters in many cells, they are essential for the maintenance of amino acid nutrition and survival of tumor cells. This study was conducted to analyze the associations of SLC7 family gene expression with mortality in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods: Clinical features, somatic mutations, and SLC7 family gene expression data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Linear regression model analysis was performed to analyze the correlations between SLC7 family gene expression and clinicopathologic features. Kaplan-Meier survival and logistic regression analyses were performed to characterize the associations between gene expression and patients' overall survival. Results: Patient mortality was negatively associated with age and tumor size but positively increased cancer stage and absence of thyroiditis in PTC patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with high SLC7A3, SLC7A5, and SLC7A11 expression levels exhibited poorer survival than those with low SLC7A3, SLC7A5, and SLC7A11 expression levels (P < 0.05 for all cases). Logistic regression analysis showed that SLC7A3, SLC7A5, and SLC7A11 were associated with increased mortality (odds ratio [OR] 8.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-55.91; OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.18-17.31; and OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.18-17.31, respectively. Conclusion: Upregulation of SLC7A3, SLC7A5, and SLC7A11 expression was associated with poor prognosis in PTC patients, and SLC7 gene expression levels are potentially useful prognostic biomarkers. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Dyspnea in cancer patients can lead to significant deleterious effects. There are multiple conditions that can cause dyspnea. It is important to determine which of these causes are potentially reversible and treatable, so that they can be promptly addressed. Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches should be used to treat this difficult condition. As patients advance in their illness, palliative treatments can be considered, such as low-dose opioids, oxygen therapy, and treatments directed at anxiety relief. Physicians should also discuss goals of care with their patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: FGD4 (Frabin) is an F-actin binding protein with GTP/GDP exchange activity specific for CDC42. It is involved in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which requires both actin binding and CDC42 activating function of FGD4. Expression of FGD4 is altered in patients with heterogeneous hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies as a result of demyelination of peripheral nerves. Methods: In this study, we examined the expression of FGD4 in prostate cancer specimens using immunohistochemistry and studied the function of FGD4 in maintaining cell phenotype, behavior and drug sensitivity using overexpression and siRNA-based silencing approaches. We used Mann-Whitney test for comparative analysis of FGD4 expression. Results: Our results show that the expression of FGD4 is upregulated in cancerous prostates compared to the luminal cells in benign prostatic hyperplasia, although the basal cells showed high staining intensities. We noted a gradual increase in the staining intensity of FGD4 with increasing aggressiveness of the disease. Inhibition of expression of FGD4 using siRNAs showed reduced proliferation and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase of androgen dependent LNCaP-104S and androgen refractory PC-3 cells. Inhibition of FGD4 also resulted in reduced cell migration and CDC42 activities in PC-3 cells whereas, ectopic expression of FGD4 induced cell migration, altered expression of mesenchymal and epithelial markers and activation of CDC42/PAK signaling pathway. Reduced expression of FGD4 improved sensitivity of LNCaP-104S cells to the anti-androgen drug Casodex and PC-3 cells to the microtubule stabilizing drug docetaxel. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate a tumor promoting and a cell migratory function of FGD4 in prostate cancer cells and that inhibition of FGD4 expression enhances the response for both androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cells towards currently used prostate cancer drugs. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Different cell types possess different copies of mtDNA to support their specific requirements for cellular metabolism. Cell-specific mtDNA copy numbers are established through cell-specific mtDNA replication during cell differentiation. However, cancer cells are trapped in a \"pseudo-differentiated\" state as they fail to expand mtDNA copy number. Global DNA methylation can regulate this process, as induced DNA demethylation promotes differentiation of cancer cells and expansion of mtDNA copy number. Results: To determine the role that mtDNA methylation plays in regulating mtDNA replication during tumorigenesis, we have characterized the patterns of mtDNA methylation using glioblastoma and osteosarcoma tumor models that have different combinations of mtDNA genotypes and copy number against common nuclear genome backgrounds at different stages of tumor progression. To ensure the reliability of the findings, we have applied a robust experimental pipeline including three approaches, namely whole-mtDNA bisulfite-sequencing with mtDNA-genotype-specific analysis, pyrosequencing, and methylated immunoprecipitation against 5mC and 5hmC. We have determined genotype-specific methylation profiles, which were modulated through tumor progression. Moreover, a strong influence from the nuclear genome was also observed on mtDNA methylation patterns using the same mtDNA genotype under different nuclear genomes. Furthermore, the numbers of mtDNA copy in tumor-initiating cells affected mtDNA methylation levels in late-stage tumors. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the influences that the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have in setting mtDNA methylation patterns to regulate mtDNA copy number in tumorigenesis. They have important implications for assessing global DNA methylation patterns in tumorigenesis and the availability of mtDNA template for mtDNA replication. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Up to 70% of survivors of adult-onset, non-central nervous system (CNS) solid tumors report cognitive symptoms, and approximately 30% have impairment on formal neuropsychological testing. The etiology of the impairment is unknown. There is a lack of robust evidence on how to prevent or treat cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). Here, we review the evidence for the putative mechanisms of CRCI by examining clinical and preclinical models, primarily those associated with chemotherapy. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options for treating CRCI are discussed based on the best evidence available. Practical clinical advice for health professionals managing patients with CRCI is also provided.",

    "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have linked aromatic amines (AAs) from tobacco smoke and some occupational exposures with bladder cancer risk. Several epidemiological studies have also reported a plausible role for structurally related heterocyclic aromatic amines present in tobacco smoke or formed in cooked meats with bladder cancer risk. DNA adduct formation is an initial biochemical event in bladder carcinogenesis. We examined paired fresh-frozen (FR) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nontumor bladder tissues from 41 bladder cancer patients for DNA adducts of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), a bladder carcinogen present in tobacco smoke, and 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, possible human carcinogens, which occur in tobacco smoke and cooked meats. These chemicals are present in urine of tobacco smokers or omnivores. Targeted DNA adduct measurements were done by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization multistage hybrid Orbitrap MS. N-(2′-Deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-ABP (N-(dG-C8)-4-ABP) was the sole adduct detected in FR and FFPE bladder tissues. Twelve subjects (29%) had N-(dG-C8)-4-ABP levels above the limit of quantification, ranging from 1.4 to 33.8 adducts per 109 nucleotides (nt). DNA adducts of other human AA bladder carcinogens, including 2-naphthylamine (2-NA), 2-methylaniline (2-MA), 2,6-dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) adducts, were screened for in bladder tissue, by our untargeted data-independent adductomics method, termed wide-selected ion monitoring (wide-SIM)/MS2. Wide-SIM/MS2 successfully detected N-(dG-C8)-4-ABP, N-(2′-deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-ABP and the presumed hydrazo linked adduct, N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-4-ABP, and several LPO adducts in bladder DNA. Wide-SIM/MS2 detected multiple DNA adducts of 2-NA, 2-MA, and, 2,6-DMA, when calf thymus DNA was modified with reactive intermediates of these carcinogens. However, these AA-adducts were below the limit of detection in unspiked human bladder DNA (&lt;1 adduct per 108 nt). Wide-SIM/MS2 can screen for many types of DNA adducts formed with exogenous and endogenous electrophiles and will be employed to identify DNA adducts of other chemicals that may contribute to the etiology of bladder cancer. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is effective in the treatment of locally advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, whether treatment outcomes of cervical adenocarcinoma are equivalent to SCC after CCRT has been a topic of debate. Methods: Medical records of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy or CCRT in our institute from January 2011 to December 2014 were reviewed. Patients were treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy combined with intracavitary brachytherapy. Weekly cisplatin was the first line regimen of concurrent chemotherapy. The treatment outcomes of patients with SCC and adenocarcinoma were compared with a multivariate Cox regression model, and log-rank method before and after propensity score matching (1:1). Results: A total of 815 patients with stage IB-IVA cervical cancer were included, with 744 patients in the SCC group and 71 patients in adenocarcinoma group. The median follow-up period was 36.2 months (range, 1.0-76.2 months). The 3-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), pelvic control and distant control rates of patients in the SCC group and adenocarcinoma group were 85.2 and 75.4% (p = 0.005), 77.5 and 57.3% (p < 0.001), 89.0 and 74.0% (p = 0.001) and 86.0 and 74.4% (p = 0.011), respectively. After multivariate analysis, histology was an independent factor of OS (p = 0.003), DFS (p < 0.001), pelvic control (p = 0.002) and distant control (p = 0.003). With propensity score matching, 71 pairs of patients were selected. After matching, the OS (p = 0.017), DFS (p = 0.001), pelvic control (p = 0.015) and distant control (p = 0.009) of patients with adenocarcinoma were poorer than those of patients with SCC. In subgroup analysis, patients with adenocarcinoma had significantly worse OS and DFS compared with patients with SCC, regardless of treatment with radiotherapy alone or CCRT. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that patients with adenocarcinoma of the cervix had poorer OS and DFS than patients with SCC, regardless of treatment with radiotherapy alone or CCRT. New treatment approaches should be considered for cervical adenocarcinoma. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Emerging research has suggested that miRNAs play a significant role in oncogenesis and tumor progression by regulating multiple molecular pathways. Here, we investigated miR-300, which inhibited bladder cancer (BCa) migration by regulating the SP1/MMP9 pathway. miR-300, belonging to the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster, is frequently expressed at lower levels in BCa tissue than in adjacent normal tissue due to DNA methylation. Reinforced expression of miR-300 significantly suppressed the migration of BCa cells. We carried out a search of online databases to predict potential targets of miR-300. Further studies determined that miR-300 directly targeted SP1 and suppressed its expression by specifically binding to its 3ʹ-untranslated region. Meanwhile, downregulated MMP9 may be the final effector of BCa cell mobility. Small interference RNAs silencing SP1 phenocopied the effects of miR-300 overexpression, while restoration of SP1 expression partially rescued the inhibition of metastasis induced by miR-300 overexpression in BCa cells. In conclusion, we unveiled a miR-300/SP1/MMP9 pathway in BCa. These findings demonstrate that miR-300 is a promising tumor suppressor in BCa. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Combination therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors significantly improves survival in BRAF mutated melanoma patients but is unable to prevent disease recurrence due to the emergence of drug resistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been involved in these long-term treatment failures. We previously reported in lung cancer that CSCs maintenance is due to altered lipid metabolism and dependent upon Stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD1)-mediated upregulation of YAP and TAZ. On this ground, we investigated the role of SCD1 in melanoma CSCs. Methods: SCD1 gene expression data of melanoma patients were downloaded from TCGA and correlated with disease progression by bioinformatics analysis and confirmed on patient's tissues by qRT-PCR and IHC analyses. The effects of combination of BRAF/MEKi and the SCD1 inhibitor MF-438 were monitored by spheroid-forming and proliferation assays on a panel of BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines grown in 3D and 2D conditions, respectively. SCD1, YAP/TAZ and stemness markers were evaluated in melanoma cells and tissues by qRT-PCR, WB and Immunofluorescence. Results: We first observed that SCD1 expression increases during melanoma progression. BRAF-mutated melanoma 3D cultures enriched for CSCs overexpressed SCD1 and were more resistant than 2D differentiated cultures to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. We next showed that exposure of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells to MAPK pathway inhibitors enhanced stemness features by upregulating the expression of YAP/TAZ and downstream genes but surprisingly not SCD1. However, SCD1 pharmacological inhibition was able to downregulate YAP/TAZ and to revert at the same time CSC enrichment and resistance to MAPK inhibitors. Conclusions: Our data underscore the role of SCD1 as prognostic marker in melanoma and promote the use of SCD1 inhibitors in combination with MAPK inhibitors for the control of drug resistance. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "A new indole alkaloid, nauclorienine (1), along with seven known alkaloids (2–8), were isolated from the stems and leaves of Nauclea orientalis. Among them, nauclorienine (1) was a new indole alkaloid holding a rare corynanthe-type skeleton, and the known compounds (2–8) were isolated from N. orientalis for the first time. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic data analyses. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against five human cancer cell lines: HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7 and SW480 in vitro. Alkaloids 1–4 exhibited significant inhibitory effects against various human cancer cell lines with IC 50 values comparable to those of cisplatin. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a glycoprotein vital to the regulation of vascular endothelial cells proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. The expression of VEGF is required for the formation of new blood vessels critical in supplying oxygen and nutrition in the course of tumorigenesis. The present study investigated the effect of 5,6-dehydrokawain isolated from the rhizomes of Alpinia mutica on VEGF expression in vitro using HT-29 cell line. The results revealed that 5,6-dehydrokawain induced the expression of proangiogenic tumour-derived VEGF of HT-29 cells, which may explain the inability of 5,6-dehydrokawain in suppressing cancer cells proliferation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were reported to be involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, its biological role and underlying mechanism in CRC remained to be elucidated. In this study, the expressions of the macrophage marker CD68 and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) in CRC tumor tissues and adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of miR-34a, TGF-β1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CRC tumor tissues and peripheral blood macrophages were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. TGF-β1 levels in culture supernatant were detected by ELISA. The cell proliferation and invasion of human CRC cell lines CL187 and HCT116 were determined by MTT assay and Transwell assay, respectively. The results showed that the expression of miR-34a was downregulated whereas TGF-β1 and VEGF were upregulated in CRC tumor tissues and peripheral blood macrophages. TGF-β1 secreted by TAMs promoted the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells. TGF-β1-mediated miR-34a downregulation contributed to the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells via upregulating VEGF. MiR-34a in vivo exerted anti-tumor effect in CRC via inhibiting VEGF expression. In conclusion, TGF-β1 secreted by TAMs promoted CRC proliferation and invasion through regulating miR-34a/VEGF axis. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Background: TRIP13 is highly expressed in several cancers and is closely connected with cancer progression. However, its roles on the growth and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the underlying mechanism are still unclear. Methods: Combining bioinformatics with previous studies, the correlation between TRIP13 and HCC was predicted. TRIP13 expressions from 52 HCC patients and several cell lines were determined. The effects of silencing TRIP13 on cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were respectively detected using CCK-8, flow cytometry and Transwell. qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to reveal associated mechanism. A HCC model was established in BALB/c-nu mice by transplanting HepG2 cells. TRIP13 protein expression and apoptosis in mice tissues were accordingly detected by Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL. Results: High expression of TRIP13 in HCC affected the survival rate and it was enriched in RNA degradation and fatty acid metabolism according to bioinformatics and prediction from previous literature. Increased expression of TRIP13 in HCC patient tissues was associated with the progression of HCC. Silencing TRIP13 inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis. TRIP13 knockdown also suppressed the formation of tumor in vivo. Meanwhile, silencing TRIP13 decreased the expressions of Ki67 and MMP-2 and increased the expressions of TIMP-2, active-caspase-3 and TGF-β1/smad3 signaling- related genes. Conclusions: Silencing TRIP13 acts as a tumor suppresser of HCC to repress cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and such a phenomenon possibly involved activation of TGF-β1/smad3 signaling. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer that occurs in plasma cells, which fall under the category of white blood cells that are in charge of antibody production. According to previous studies, microRNA-497 (miR-497) functions as a tumor suppressor in several types of cancer, including gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the effects of miR-497 on cellular function of human MM cells through the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway by targeting Raf-1. The differentially expressed genes and miRs in MM, and the relationship between the miR and gene were verified. It was found that Raf-1 was a target gene of miR-497. The data obtained from MM tissues showed increased Raf-1 level and decreased miR-497 level. MM cells were treated with mimic, inhibitor and siRNA in order to evaluate the role of miR-497, Raf-1 and MAPK/ERK in MM. The expression pattern of miR-497, Raf-1, ERK1/2, survivin, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and BCL2-Associated X (Bax) as well as the extent of ERK1/2 phosphorylation were determined. Retored miR-497 and si-Raf-1 resulted in increases in the Bax expression and cell apoptosis and decreases in the expressions of Raf-1, MEK-2, survivin, Bcl-2, along with the extent of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, the biological function evaluations of MM cells revealed that miR-497 mimic or si-Raf-1 led to suppression in cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In conclusion, our results have demonstrated that miR-497 targets Raf-1 in order to inhibit the progression of MM by blocking the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication of lung cancer. Accumulating evidence has suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in oncogenesis and progression of cancer. However, the expression pattern of circRNAs in MPE remains largely unknown and awaits investigation. The study was designed to elucidate the potential roles of differentially expressed circRNAs in MPE. Herein, we detected a total of 1350 differentially expressed circRNAs and 1727 differentially expressed mRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma-associated malignant pleural effusion (LA-MPE) compared with tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) by Clariom D Human Microarray. Among the top 5 up-regulated circRNAs (hsa_circ_0067705, hsa_circ_0025542, hsa_circ_0072793, hsa_circ_0084927, and hsa_circ_0085386), four were verified significantly up-regulated in LA-MPE by qRT-PCR and hsa_circ_0085386 had an increasing trend. CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA network for the top 5 up-regulated circRNAs was constructed and pathway analysis indicated that the enriched mRNA targets involved in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Axon guidance, Regulation of actin cytoskeleton and Rap1 signaling pathway were potentially regulated by these aberrantly expressed circRNAs. We generated specific circRNA profiles in LA-MPE for the first time. And analysis of circRNA regulatory network could provide evidence that circRNAs are important in MPE development because they participate in cancer-related pathways by sequestering miRNAs. Our findings suggested that aberrantly expressed circRNAs may be involved in the development of LA-MPE. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Chemical examination of Chinese mangrove Rhizophora mucronata endophytic Pestalotiopsis sp., yielded  11 known metabolites with various structure types, including demethylincisterol A 3 (1), dankasterone B (2), (22E, 24R)-ergosta-7,9(11), 22-triene-3β, 5α, 6α-triol (3), ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3-ol (4), 5, 8-epidioxy-5, 8-ergosta-6, 22E-dien-3-ol (5), stigmastan-3-one (6), stigmast-4-en-3-one (7), stigmast-4-en-6 -ol-3-one (8), flufuran (9), (2-cis, 4-trans)-abscisic acid (10), similanpyrone B (11). Their structures were unambiguously elucidated on the basis of extensive NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analyses. Compounds 1, 4, 6–9 showed significant in vitro cytotoxicity against the human cancer cell lines Hela, A549 and HepG, of which compound 1 was the most potential with IC 50 values reaching nM degree ranging from 0.17 to 14.16 nM. Flow cytometric investigation demonstrated that compound 1 mainly inhibited cell cycle at G 0 /G 1 phase in a dose-dependent manner with a significant induction of apoptosis on the three tested cell lines. The involvement of the mitochondria in compound 1 induced apoptosis was investigated using MMP. We suggested that R. mucronata endophytic Pestalotiopsis sp. contained a potential anticancer compound demethylincisterol A 3 . © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Prisoner access to opiate-based analgesics and gabapentinoids is a concern to prisons through illicit trading. The purpose of this paper is to describe patient needs following introduction of nine pilot chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) clinics for chronic pain in three prisons (two male and one female) in the South of England. The study evaluated the effectiveness of this model and assessed the wider practical implementation issues. Design/methodology/approach: Clinical notes were reviewed for 63 consultations, anonymised and recorded for secondary analysis. Findings: Alongside CNCP, high levels of substance misuse, physical and mental health histories were noted, especially for female patients. Amitriptyline, pregabalin, gabapentin were the main frontline analgesics prescribed prior to assessment. A total of 41 per cent of patients did not change their medication following the consultation; 25 per cent had their medication increased or reintroduced (greater for women prisoners); with one-third (33 per cent) of patients reducing the prescription of strong opioids and gabapentinoids. Significant differences were noted between male and female patients. Prisoners were amenable to changes in medication to facilitate access to work and other therapeutic interventions. Social implications: The prescribing of analgesics has largely been couched in terms of disruption to the prison regime through illicit trading. This study highlights the need to place CNCP within wider contexts of substance misuse, physical and emotional health. There is an opportunity to develop a rehabilitative rather than palliative approach to pain management. Gender specific approaches for female patients should be considered. Originality/value: Few studies of CNCP have been conducted within a prison environment. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "The phytochemical study of Laelia marginata (Lindl.) L. O. Williams (Orchidaceae) led to the isolation of a new natural product named crispoic acid (1), together with six other known compounds (2–7). The new natural product was identified as a dimer of eucomic acid and was structurally characterised based upon 1D and 2D NMR and HRMS data. Biological assays with plant crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were performed against two human cancer cell lines (Hela and Siha), and the tropical parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. The phenantrenoid 9,10-dihydro-4-methoxyphenanthren-2,7-diol 2 was active against Hela and Siha cells (CC 50 5.86 ± 0.19 and 20.78 ± 2.72 μg/mL, respectively). Sub-lethal concentrations of the flavone rhamnazin 4 were not able to rescue the viability of the Vero cells infected by Zika virus. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) is the second common subtype of non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC), which accounting for 4-5% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, there is no effective bio-marker to predict clinical outcomes of this malignant disease. Bioinformatic methods may provide a feasible potential to solve this problem. Methods: In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of ChRCC samples on The Cancer Genome Atlas database were filtered out to construct co-expression modules by weighted gene co-expression network analysis and the key module were identified by calculating module-trait correlations. Functional analysis was performed on the key module and candidate hub genes were screened out by co-expression and MCODE analysis. Afterwards, real hub genes were filter out in an independent dataset GSE15641 and validated by survival analysis. Results: Overall 2215 DEGs were screened out to construct eight co-expression modules. Brown module was identified as the key module for the highest correlations with pathologic stage, neoplasm status and survival status. 29 candidate hub genes were identified. GO and KEGG analysis demonstrated most candidate genes were enriched in mitotic cell cycle. Three real hub genes (SKA1, ERCC6L, GTSE-1) were selected out after mapping candidate genes to GSE15641 and two of them (SKA1, ERCC6L) were significantly related to overall survivals of ChRCC patients. Conclusions: In summary, our findings identified molecular markers correlated with progression and prognosis of ChRCC, which might provide new implications for improving risk evaluation, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis prediction in ChRCC patients. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Two new sceptrin derivatives (1,2) and eight structurally-related known bromopyrrole-bearing alkaloids were isolated from the tropical sponge Agelas kosrae. By a combination of spectroscopic methods, the new compounds, designated dioxysceptrin (1) and ageleste C (2), were determined to be structural analogs of each other that differ at the imidazole moiety. Dioxysceptrin was also found to exist as a mixture of α-amido epimers. The sceptrin alkaloids exhibited weak cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Compounds 1 and 2 also moderately exhibited anti-angiogenic and isocitrate lyase-inhibitory activities, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Rapamycin inhibits cell proliferation, yet preserves (re)-proliferative potential (RPP). RPP is a potential of quiescent cells that is lost in senescent cells. mTOR drives conversion from quiescence to senescence (geroconversion). By suppressing geroconversion, rapamycin preserves RPP. Geroconversion is characterized by proliferation-like levels of phospho-S6K/S6/4E-BP1 in nonproliferating cells arrested by p16 and/or p21. mTOR-driven geroconversion is associated with cellular hyperfunction, which in turn leads to organismal aging manifested by age-related diseases. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "The two programmed death 1 checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as second-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on the existing data, the effectiveness of these two drugs is similar in this setting. When choosing between them, the decision should be individualized and can be determined by patient and provider preferences, as well as scheduling. Testing for tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and human papillomavirus status is not required for use of these checkpoint inhibitors in the second-line setting, but the level of tumor PD-L1 expression can be useful for decision making in special situations. There are many ongoing trials that are studying immunotherapy as frontline treatment for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, as well as trials combining immunotherapy with definitive chemoradiation in locally advanced disease. Based on the updated results of the KEYNOTE-048 trial, checkpoint inhibitors will likely be a part of first-line therapy in the near future.",

    "Abstract": "Background: For analyzing these gene expression data sets under different samples, clustering and visualizing samples and genes are important methods. However, it is difficult to integrate clustering and visualizing techniques when the similarities of samples and genes are defined by PCC(Person correlation coefficient) measure. Results: Here, for rare samples of gene expression data sets, we use MG-PCC (mini-groups that are defined by PCC) algorithm to divide them into mini-groups, and use t-SNE-SSP maps to display these mini-groups, where the idea of MG-PCC algorithm is that the nearest neighbors should be in the same mini-groups, t-SNE-SSP map is selected from a series of t-SNE(t-statistic Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) maps of standardized samples, and these t-SNE maps have different perplexity parameter. Moreover, for PCC clusters of mass genes, they are displayed by t-SNE-SGI map, where t-SNE-SGI map is selected from a series of t-SNE maps of standardized genes, and these t-SNE maps have different initialization dimensions. Here, t-SNE-SSP and t-SNE-SGI maps are selected by A-value, where A-value is modeled from areas of clustering projections, and t-SNE-SSP and t-SNE-SGI maps are such t-SNE map that has the smallest A-value. Conclusions: From the analysis of cancer gene expression data sets, we demonstrate that MG-PCC algorithm is able to put tumor and normal samples into their respective mini-groups, and t-SNE-SSP(or t-SNE-SGI) maps are able to display the relationships between mini-groups(or PCC clusters) clearly. Furthermore, t-SNE-SS(m)(or t-SNE-SG(n)) maps are able to construct independent tree diagrams of the nearest sample(or gene) neighbors, where each tree diagram is corresponding to a mini-group of samples(or genes). © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Benign breast papilloma is currently managed with conservative management with close observation. In contrast, papilloma with high-risk or malignant lesions warrants surgical excision. The purpose of our study was to investigate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of breast papilloma and to identify imaging diagnostic indicators for papilloma with high-risk or malignant lesions. Methods: MRI features of 175 surgically confirmed papillomas on 158 patients were retrospectively reviewed. The 175 cases included 132 cases of benign papilloma and 43 cases of papilloma with high-risk or malignant lesions. The MRI features of these lesions were classified into three types: mass, non-mass enhancement (NME), and occult lesion. The occult lesion was defined as the presence of only ductal dilation without any enhanced lesions on MRI. For a mass lesion, the mixed mass-NME lesion was considered if linear, segmental or regional enhanced lesion was found adjacent to the mass. Clinical and MRI features were compared by univariate and multivariate analysis between the benign papilloma and the papilloma with high-risk or malignant lesions. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that clinical characteristics including being or older than 50 years (odds ratio [OR] = 4.506), having bloody nipple discharge (OR = 4.499), and concurrent breast cancer (OR = 5.083) were significant indicators for papilloma with high-risk or malignant lesions. On MRI, most papillomas presented as mass (n = 135, 77.1%), and fewer as NME (n = 37, 21.1%) and occult lesion (n = 3, 1.7%). For the mass lesion, the logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a mass size exceeding 10 mm (OR = 2.956) and mixed mass-NME lesion (OR = 4.143) were independent risk indicators for a papilloma with high-risk or malignant lesions. For the NME lesion, the segmental or regional distribution was more commonly observed in the papilloma with high-risk or malignant lesions (61.5%) than the benign papilloma (12.5%) (P = 0.006). All the cases of occult lesions were benign papillomas. Conclusions: MRI features including a mass size exceeding 10 mm, mixed mass-NME lesion, and NMEs with segmental or regional distribution indicate a papilloma with high-risk or malignant lesions. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The spindle assembly checkpoint prevents chromosome mis-segregation during mitosis by delaying sister chromatid separation. Several F-box protein members play critical roles in maintaining genome stability and regulating cell cycle progress via ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Here, we showed that Fbxo6 critically regulated spindle checkpoint and chromosome segregation. Fbxo6 was phosphorylated during mitosis. Overexpression of Fbxo6 lead to faster exit from nocodazole-induced mitosis arrest through premature sister chromatid separation. Moreover, we found substantially more binuclear and multilobed nuclei cells accompanied with impaired cell viability in Fbxo6-overexpressed HeLa cells. Mechanistically, Fbxo6 interacted with spindle checkpoint proteins including Mad2 and BubR1 leading to the premature exit from mitosis. Overall, we revealed a novel role of Fbxo6 in regulating spindle checkpoint, which may shed light on the regulation of genome instability of cancer cells. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "We report here on a light addressable potassium (K+) sensor where light illumination of a semiconducting silicon electrode substrate results in a localized activation of the faradaic electrochemistry at the illuminated spot. This allows one, by electrochemical control, to oxidize surface bound ferrocene moieties that in turn trigger K+ transfer from the overlaid K+-selective film to the solution phase. The resulting voltammetric response is shown to be K+-selective, where peak position is a direct function of K+ activity at the surface of electrode. This concept was used to measure extracellular K+ concentration changes by stimulating living breast cancer cells. The associated decrease of intracellular K+ level was confirmed with a fluorescent K+ indicator. In contrast to light addressable potentiometry, the approach introduced here relies on dynamic electrochemistry and may be performed in tandem with other electrochemical analysis when studying biological events on the electrode. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    "Abstract": "Cytochrome c (Cyt c), a heme protein, can be a potential biomarker for cell-apoptosis or even cancer diagnosis. In this work, a simple, rapid, sensitive and selective label-free assay for Cytochrome c (Cyt c) detection is introduced based on an interaction between nucleic acid aptamer biomolecules and surfaces of Carbon Dots (CDs). CDs are used as a fluorescent probes and Cyt c-aptamers as a sensing materials. Interactions of aptamers with CDs quench the fluorescent intensity of CDs. By addition of Cyt c biomolecule as an analyte to the solution and binding to the aptamers, CDs fluorescence turns on. Stronger binding affinity of the aptamers toward Cyt c than CDs, causes they leave the CDs surfaces and the fluorescence is recovered. The amount of recoveries corresponds linearly to the concentration of Cyt c and be used as the basis of detection. The method exhibited high sensitivity to Cyt c with a detection limit of 25.90 nM and a linear range from 40 nM to 240 nM.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Acute myeloid leukemia can develop as myoblasts infiltrate into organs and tissues anywhere other than the bone marrow, which called extramedullary infiltration (EMI), indicating a poor prognosis. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that feature covalently closed continuous loops, suggesting their potential as micro RNA (miRNA) \"sponges\" that can participate in biological processes and pathogenesis. However, investigations on circRNAs in EMI were conducted rarely. In this study, the overall alterations of circRNAs and their regulatory network between EMI and non-EMI AML were delineated. Methods: CircRNA and whole genome microarrays derived from EMI and non-EMI AML bone marrow mononuclear cells were carried out. Functional analysis was performed via Gene Ontology and KEGG test methods. The speculated functional roles of circRNAs were based on mRNAs and predicted miRNAs that played intermediate roles. Integrated bioinformatic analysis was conducted to further characterize the circRNA/miRNA/mRNA regulatory network and identify the functions of distinct circRNAs. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were acquired to evaluate the poor prognosis of distinct target genes of circRNAs. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to identify the expression of has-circRNA-0004520. Connectivity map (CMap) analysis was further performed to predict potential therapeutic agents for EMI. Results: 253 circRNAs and 663 genes were upregulated and 259 circRNAs and 838 genes were downregulated in EMI compared to non-EMI AML samples. GO pathways were enriched in progress including cell adhesion (GO:0030155; GO:0007155), migration (GO:0016477; GO:0030334), signal transduction (GO:0009966; GO:0007165) and cell-cell communication. Overlapping circRNAs envolved in pathways related to regulate cell-cell crosstalk, 17 circRNAs were chosen based on their putative roles. 7 target genes of 17 circRNAs (LRRK1, PLXNB2, OLFML2A, LYPD5, APOL3, ZNF511, and ASB2) indicated a poor prognosis, while overexpression of PAPLN and NRXN3 indicated a better one based on data from TCGA. LY-294002, trichostatin A and SB-202190 were identified as therapeutic candidates for EMI by the CMap analysis. Conclusion: Taken together, this study reveals the overall alterations of circRNA and mRNA involved in EMI and suggests potential circRNAs may act as biomarkers and targets for early diagnosis and treatment of EMI. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we report a new hydrazine-functionalized Al(III)- based metal-organic framework having MIL-53 (MIL = Material of Institute Lavoisier) framework topology for the sensitive and selective detection of formaldehyde (FA). The phase purity of the thermally activated and as-synthesized forms of the material was examined by X-ray powder diffraction experiments, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The desolvated material (1′) showed great potential for the selective sensing of FA in the existence of other potentially competitive aldehydes in both aqueous and 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.4) media. The fluorescence \"turn-on\" behavior of the reaction-based probe can be ascribed to the inhibition of the photoinduced electron transfer process (from the hydrazine group to the phenyl ring) because of the formation of the hydrazone moiety. The detection limit of the probe toward FA in HEPES buffer is 8.37 μM (0.25 ppm), which lies below the intracellular concentration of FA (100-400 μM). A very short response time (1 min) has been displayed by 1′ for FA sensing. Moreover, a remarkable enhancement in the emission intensity (sevenfold and fourfold in aqueous and HEPES buffer media, respectively) of 1′ was observed after 1 min of FA addition. Furthermore, the ability of the probe to detect FA in the vapor phase was demonstrated. Interestingly, the material is also capable to detect endogenous FA in cancer cells. All the above discussed features clearly reveal that the present material has a huge potential for selective recognition of FA in both real water and biological samples.

    "Abstract": "Novel biomarkers for screening, diagnosis and monitoring the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), one of the most common cancers in Vietnam, are urgently required. Increasing evidence suggests that microRNA-141 (miR-141) is associated with NPC, owing to its ability to affect the expression of genes that modulate tumorigenesis. Unfortunately, research on miR-141 expression in Vietnamese patients is limited. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate miR-141 expression and assess whether miR-141 might be a potential biomarker for diagnosis of NPC in Vietnamese patients. Total RNA isolated from 40 NPC biopsy samples and 37 non-cancerous samples was analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. The miR-141 expression levels were compared between NPC biopsy and non-cancerous samples. The frequency of miR-141 detection was 37.50% and 10.80% in the NPC and non-cancerous samples, respectively (p = 0.0143). The miR-141 expression was 5.27 times higher in tumor samples than non-cancerous samples. Additionally, the RR (Relative risk) and OR (Odds ratio) were 1.83 (95%CI = 1.2576-2.6675, p = 0.0016) and 4.95 (95%CI = 1.4625-16.7541, p = 0.01), respectively. In conclusion, miR-141 was up-regulated in the biopsy samples and thus may be a potential biomarker for NPC in the Vietnamese population.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a form of non-small cell lung carcinoma that originates from the submucosal glands of the tracheobronchial tree; it is rare and causes 0.1% to 0.2% of lung malignancies. In this article, we report on an occurrence of this condition in an 81-year-old male, which is rare occurrence in this age group. In this case, we found a history of smoking and asbestos exposure which might suggest that exposure to both of these factors can possibly increase the risk for this malignancy. CASE REPORT An 81-year-old male presented with chronic cough and yellow sputum, associated with right upper back pain. The patient was a smoker of 30 packs per year and reported a history of asbestos exposure. He had past medical history of rectal cancer, but no previous history of salivary glands tumors. Physical examination was normal, laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Computed tomography chest showed endobronchial mass with post-obstructive atelectasis. Bronchoscopic evaluation revealed a whitish, endobronchial mass occluding the posterior segment of the right lower lobe. Biopsy showed benign squamous papilloma and malignancy was not excluded as only superficial parts of the mass were obtained. The decision was made to remove the lesion. A right lower lobectomy was done, and histopathology revealed a low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma; immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells positive for p40 and p63 supporting the diagnosis. No further adjuvant treatment was recommended, and follow-up imaging was planned for surveillance. CONCLUSIONS Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the lung is a rare form of non-small cell lung carcinoma. Appropriate diagnosis requires correctly interpreted biopsy results along with immunohistochemical staining results.",

    "Abstract": "Parrots are one of the most distinct and intriguing groups of birds, with highly expanded brains [1], highly developed cognitive [2] and vocal communication [3] skills, and a long lifespan compared to other similar-sized birds [4]. Yet the genetic basis of these traits remains largely unidentified. To address this question, we have generated a high-coverage, annotated assembly of the genome of the blue-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva) and carried out extensive comparative analyses with 30 other avian species, including 4 additional parrots. We identified several genomic features unique to parrots, including parrot-specific novel genes and parrot-specific modifications to coding and regulatory sequences of existing genes. We also discovered genomic features under strong selection in parrots and other long-lived birds, including genes previously associated with lifespan determination as well as several hundred new candidate genes. These genes support a range of cellular functions, including telomerase activity; DNA damage repair; control of cell proliferation, cancer, and immunity; and anti-oxidative mechanisms. We also identified brain-expressed, parrot-specific paralogs with known functions in neural development or vocal-learning brain circuits. Intriguingly, parrot-specific changes in conserved regulatory sequences were overwhelmingly associated with genes that are linked to cognitive abilities and have undergone similar selection in the human lineage, suggesting convergent evolution. These findings bring novel insights into the genetics and evolution of longevity and cognition, as well as provide novel targets for exploring the mechanistic basis of these traits. © 2018 Elsevier LtdThe genetic basis for the complex traits that characterize parrots, including extreme longevity and advanced cognition, remains unknown. Wirthlin et al. present the genome of the blue-fronted Amazon, Amazona aestiva. Comparisons with other birds and humans reveal genomic similarities, suggesting convergent mechanisms in the evolution of these traits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Ocular melanoma is a rare but often deadly malignancy that arises in the uvea (commonest primary site), conjunctiva or the orbit. Primary orbital melanoma (POM) is exceedingly rare, with approximately 60 cases reported to date. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of primary uveal and conjunctival melanomas, this information is lacking for POM. Methods: DNA was extracted from 12 POM tissues, with matched germline DNA (where available). MLPA was conducted to detect chromosomal alterations and Sanger sequencing used to identify point mutations in candidate melanoma driver genes (BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, GNA11, GNAQ), and other genes implicated in melanoma prognosis (EIF1AX, SF3B1). Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyse BAP1 nuclear expression. Results: MLPA detected copy number alterations in chromosomes 1p, 3, 6 and 8. Sequencing of melanoma driver genes revealed GNAQ (p.Q209L) mutations in two samples; although it is possible that these samples represent extraocular spread of an occult uveal melanoma. A recurrent mutation in SF3B1 (p.R625H) was observed in indolent, but not aggressive, tumours; a mutation in EIF1AX (p.N4S) was detected in one patient with non-aggressive disease. Conclusions: EIF1AX and SF3B1 mutations appear have a role in determining the clinical course of POM and detection of these changes could have clinical significance. Further in depth analysis of this rare group using differing 'omic technologies will provide novel insights into tumour pathogenesis. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Surgery is an important part of multidisciplinary treatment strategy for locally advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), but insufficient evidence supports the feasibility and safety of video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced LSCC. This study aims to compare perioperative data and long-term survival of locally advanced LSCC patients between VATS and thoracotomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively collected the clinical and pathological information of patients with locally advanced LSCC who underwent surgical resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy from October 2013 to October 2017. All patients were divided into two groups (thoracotomy and VATS) and were compared the differences in perioperative, oncological and survival outcomes. Results: A total of 81 patients were analyzed in this study (67 thoracotomy and 14 VATS). VATS provided less postoperative pain (P = 0.005) and produced less volume of chest drainage (P = 0.019) than thoracotomy, but the number of resected lymph nodes was less in VATS group (P = 0.011). However, there was no significant difference in the number of resected lymph node stations and the rate of nodal upstaging between two groups. The mean disease free survival (DFS) was 32.7 ± 2.7 months for the thoracotomy group and 31.8 ± 3.0 months for the VATS group (P = 0.335); the corresponding overall survival (OS) was 41.7 ± 2.2 months and 36.4 ± 4.1 months (P = 0.925). Conclusion: In selected patients with locally advanced LSCC, VATS played a positive role in postoperative recovery and associated similar survival outcome compared with thoracotomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Predicting prognosis in patients from large-scale genomic data is a fundamentally challenging problem in genomic medicine. However, the prognosis still remains poor in many diseases. The poor prognosis may be caused by high complexity of biological systems, where multiple biological components and their hierarchical relationships are involved. Moreover, it is challenging to develop robust computational solutions with high-dimension, low-sample size data. Results: In this study, we propose a Pathway-Associated Sparse Deep Neural Network (PASNet) that not only predicts patients' prognoses but also describes complex biological processes regarding biological pathways for prognosis. PASNet models a multilayered, hierarchical biological system of genes and pathways to predict clinical outcomes by leveraging deep learning. The sparse solution of PASNet provides the capability of model interpretability that most conventional fully-connected neural networks lack. We applied PASNet for long-term survival prediction in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is a primary brain cancer that shows poor prognostic performance. The predictive performance of PASNet was evaluated with multiple cross-validation experiments. PASNet showed a higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F1-score than previous long-term survival prediction classifiers, and the significance of PASNet's performance was assessed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Furthermore, the biological pathways, found in PASNet, were referred to as significant pathways in GBM in previous biology and medicine research. Conclusions: PASNet can describe the different biological systems of clinical outcomes for prognostic prediction as well as predicting prognosis more accurately than the current state-of-the-art methods. PASNet is the first pathway-based deep neural network that represents hierarchical representations of genes and pathways and their nonlinear effects, to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, PASNet would be promising due to its flexible model representation and interpretability, embodying the strengths of deep learning. The open-source code of PASNet is available at https://github.com/DataX-JieHao/PASNet. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: The evolution of molecular studies in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) has enlightened us the understanding of this complex disease consisting of polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The epidemiology is well described in the western world but not in Asian countries like Malaysia. Materials and methods: This retrospective national registry of MPN was conducted from year 2009 to 2015 in Malaysia. Results: A total of 1010 patients were registered over a period of 5 years. The mean age was 54 years with male predominance. The ethnic distribution revealed that Chinese had a relatively high weighted incidence proportion (43.2%), followed by Indian (23.8%), Malay (15.8%) and other ethnic groups (17.2%). The types of MPN reported were 40.4% of ET (n = 408), 38.1% of PV (n = 385), 9.2% of PMF (n = 93), 3.1% of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) (n = 31) and 7.9% of unclassifiable MPN (MPN-U) (n = 80). Splenomegaly was only palpable clinically in 32.2% of patients. The positive JAK2 V617F mutation was present in 644 patients with 46.6% in PV, 36.0% in ET, 9.0% in PMF, and 7.4% in MPN-U, and had significantly lower haemoglobin (p < 0.001), haematocrit (p < 0.001) and white blood cells (WBC) (p < 0.001) than those with negative mutation. Significant differences in platelet and WBC count were detected in ethnic groups and MPN sub-types. There were more arterial thrombosis events seen in those with JAK2 V617F mutation as compared to venous thrombosis events (23.1% vs 4.4%). The bleeding rate was only 6.6%. Among the risk factors, previous thrombosis, old age (≥ 60 years) and hypertension were significantly correlated to positive JAK2 V617F mutation. The arterial thrombosis event is associated with higher presenting HB, HCT and PLT while the bleeding event is associated with lower presenting HB, HCT but higher PLT. The presence of JAK2 V617F mutation is associated with higher risk of arterial thrombosis. Conclusion: Chinese ethnicity is associated with higher rates of MPN. The history of thrombosis, age ≥ 60 years and hypertension are risk factors that can be correlated to JAK2 V617F mutation. This study is instrumental for policy makers to ensure preventive strategies can be implemented in future. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Genetic alterations in pediatric primary brain tumors can be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers and are the basis for the development of new target therapies that, ideally, would be associated with lower mortality and morbidity. This study evaluates the incidence and interplay of the presence of BRAF V600E mutation and chromosomal 9p21 deletions in a series of 100 pediatric gliomas, aiming to determine the role of these alterations in recurrence and malignant transformation, and to verify if they could be used in the clinical set for stratifying patients for tailored therapies and surveillance. Methods: Sanger sequencing was used for the assessment of BRAF mutations at exon 15 and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with BAC: RP11-14192 for the detection of 9p21 alterations. Expression levels of the CDKN2A and MTAP by real-time PCR were evaluated in cases with 9p21 deletions. Statistical analysis of genetic and clinical data was performed using Graph Pad Prism 5 and SPSS Statistics 24 software. Results: In our cohort it was observed that 7 /78 (8,9%) of the low-grade tumors recurred and 2 (2,6%) showed malignant transformation. BRAF V600E mutations were detected in 15 cases. No statistically significant correlations were found between the presence of BRAF V600E mutation and patient's morphologic or clinical features. Deletions at 9p21 abrogating the CDKN2A/B and MTAP loci were rare in grade I gliomas (12.2%, p = 0.0178) but frequent in grade IV gliomas (62.5%, p = 0.0087). Moreover it was found that deletions at these loci were correlated with a shorter overall survival (p = 0.011) and a shorter progression-free survival (p = 0.016). Conclusions: It was demonstrated that in these tumors BRAF V600E mutated and that CDKN2A/B MTAP co-deletions may be used for stratifying patients for a stricter surveillance. The Investigating and defining if glial tumors with CDKN2A/B and MTAP homozygous loss may be vulnerable to new forms of therapy, namely those affecting the methionine salvage pathway, was proven to be of importance. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: To report our experience in planning and delivering total marrow irradiation (TMI) and total marrow and lymphatic irradiation (TMLI) in patients with hematologic malignancies. Methods: Twenty-seven patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation were treated with TMI/TMLI using Helical Tomotherapy (HT). All skeletal bones exclusion of the mandible comprised the treatment target volume and, for TMLI, lymph node chains, liver, spleen and/or brain were also included according to the clinical indication. Planned dose of 8Gy in 2 fractions was delivered over 1 day for TMI while 10Gy in 2 fractions BID was used for TMLI. Organs at risk (OAR) contoured included the brain, brainstem, lens, eyes, optic nerves, parotids, oral cavity, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, small bowel, bladder and rectum. In particular, a simple method to avoid hot or cold doses in the overlapping region was implemented and the plan sum was adopted to evaluate dose inhomogeneity. Furthermore, setup errors from 54 treatments were summarized to gauge the effectiveness of immobilization. Results: During the TMI/TMLI treatment, no acute adverse effects occurred during the radiation treatment. Two patients suffered nausea or vomiting right after radiation course. For the 9 patients treated with TMI, the median dose reduction of major organs varied 30-65% of the prescribed dose, substantially lower than the traditional total body irradiation (TBI). Meanwhile, average biological equivalent doses to OARs with 8Gy/2F TMI approach were not different from the conventional 12Gy/6F TMI approach. In the dose junction region, the 93% of PTV was covered by the prescribed dose without obvious hotspots. For the 27 patients, the overall setup corrections were lower than 3 mm except those in the SI direction for abdomen-pelvis region, demonstrating excellent immobilization. Conclusion: The present study confirmed the technical feasibility of HT-based TMI/TMLI delivering 8-10Gy in 2 fractions over 1 day. For patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation the proposed 8Gy/2F TMI (or 10Gy/2F TMLI) strategy may be a novel approach to improve delivery efficiency, increase effective radiation dose to target while maintaining low risk of severe organ toxicities. © 2018 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is a treatment option for selected early stage breast cancer patients. Some APBI techniques lead to skin toxicity with the skin dose as main risk factor. We hypothesize that a spacer injected between the skin and target volume reduces the skin dose and subsequent toxicity in permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) patients. Methods: In this parallel-group, single-center, randomized controlled trial, the effect of a subcutaneous spacer injection on skin toxicity among patients treated with PBSI is tested. Eligibility for participation is derived from international guidelines for suitable patients for partial breast radiotherapy, e.g. women aged ≥ 50 years with a histologically proven non-lobular breast carcinoma and/or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), tumor size ≤ 3 cm, node-negative, and PBSI technically feasible. Among exclusion criteria are neoadjuvant chemotherapy, lymphovascular invasion, and allergy for hyaluronic acid. For the patients allocated to receive spacer, after the PBSI procedure, 4-10 cc of biodegradable hyaluronic acid (Barrigel™, Palette Life Sciences, Santa Barbara, CA, USA or Restylane SubQ®, Galderma Benelux, Breda, the Netherlands) is injected directly under the skin using ultrasound guidance to create an extra 0.5-1 cm space between the treatment volume and the skin. The primary outcome is the rate of telangiectasia at two years, blindly assessed using Bentzen's 4-point scale. Secondary outcomes include: local recurrence; disease-free and overall survival rates; adverse events (pain, redness, skin/subcutaneous induration, radiation dermatitis, pigmentation, surgical site infection); skin dose; cosmetic and functional results; and health-related quality of life. A Fisher's exact test will be used to test differences between groups on the primary outcome. Previous studies found 22.4% telangiectasia at two years. We expect the use of a spacer could reduce the occurrence of telangiectasia to 7.7%. A sample size of 230 patients will allow for a 10% lost to follow-up rate. Discussion: In this study, the effect of a subcutaneous spacer injection on the skin dose, late skin toxicity, and cosmetic outcome is tested in patients treated with PBSI in the setting of breast-conserving therapy. Our results will be relevant for most forms of breast brachytherapy as well as robotic radiosurgery, as skin spacers could protect the skin with these other techniques.

    "Abstract": "There is considerable debate regarding the role that 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations play in cancer risk or mortality, with earlier studies drawing mixed conclusions. Using data from the UK Biobank (UKB), we evaluate whether genetically predicted 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with overall cancer susceptibility and cancer mortality using five 25(OH)D genetic markers. Data comprised 438 870 white British UKB participants aged 37-73, including 46 155 cancer cases and 6998 cancer-specific deaths. Participants with keratinocyte cancers and/or benign tumors were excluded from the analysis. Odds ratios were calculated per 20 nmol/L increase in genetically predicted 25(OH)D for cancer risk and cancer mortality. For individual cancer risks, estimates were meta-analyzed with publicly available data using a fixed-effect inverse-variance-weighted model. We demonstrated that genetically low plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with increased cancer risk nor cancer mortality. Stratification by sex or cancer types did not reveal any meaningful differences albeit wider confidence intervals. Fixed-effect meta-analysis of our individual cancer risk estimates with those derived from publicly available cancer consortia data and previous studies further reinforced our null Mendelian randomization findings on prostate, lung, colorectal and breast cancers with tight confidence intervals; for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, our estimates were less precise despite being not statistically significant. Taken altogether, our results provide no genetic evidence for an association between vitamin D and overall cancer outcomes, with tight confidence intervals to exclude all but very small effect sizes.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer survival is an important indicator for quality of cancer care. We sought to determine if there are differences in cancer survival between immigrants and the host population in Norway. We performed a nationwide registry-based study comprising subjects diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 2014, and followed until the end of 2016. Survival was estimated for 13 cancer sites with cause-specific survival. Adjustments were made for common confounders (age, sex, year of diagnosis and place of residence) and defined mediators (stage at diagnosis, comorbidity and socioeconomic factors). A total of 500,255 subjects were available for analysis, of which 11,252 were Western and 8,701 non-Western immigrants. We did not find differences in cancer survival between Western immigrants and Norwegians, while non-Western immigrants, with some exceptions, had similar or better survival. Better lung cancer survival in non-Western immigrants than Norwegians was notable (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.78 (0.71–0.85)), and not explained by defined mediators. Immigrants from Eastern Europe and Balkan with melanoma (hazard ratio: 1.54 (1.12–2.12)) and prostate cancer (hazard ratio: 1.34 (1.08–1.67)), and possibly from sub-Saharan Africa with breast cancer (hazard ratio: 1.41 (0.94–2.12)) had worse survival than Norwegians. The results suggest that immigrants in Norway have good cancer survival relative to the host population. Poor survival in immigrants from Eastern Europe and Balkan with melanoma and prostate cancer, and sub-Saharan Africa with breast cancer might be a concern. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: We aim to investigate whether a difference exists between right-sided and left-sided colon cancer at the same disease stage and subsequent liver metastasis and identify whether tumor location can independently influence survival. Methods: Right-sided colon cancer was defined as malignancy arising from the cecum to the transverse colon; left-sided colon cancer was defined as malignancy arising from the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon. Clinicopathological features and survival data were collected for analysis. Results: Overall, 1442 patients were included for analysis. The median follow-up time was 58.2 months. Patients with left-sided colon cancer had better 5-year overall survival (75.2% vs 61.7%, P = 0.005), 5-year cancer-specific survival (81.6% vs 73.4%, P = 0.001), and 5-year recurrence-free survival (70.9% vs 66.5%, P = 0.033) compared with patients having right-sided colon cancer. After the presentation of subsequent liver metastasis, patients with primary left-sided colon cancer had better 3-year cancer-specific survival (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, cancer location was an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival (right vs left, HR: 1.276, 95% CI: 1.002-1.625). Conclusions: The primary tumor location can serve as a prognostic factor for treatment outcomes either in primary stage III colon cancer or subsequent liver metastasis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The risk of subsequent breast cancer among female childhood cancer survivors is markedly elevated. We aimed to determine genetic contributions to this risk, focusing on polygenic determinants implicated in breast cancer susceptibility in the general population. Experimental Design: Whole-genome sequencing (30) was performed on survivors in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort, and germline mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes were classified for pathogenicity. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was constructed for each survivor using 170 established common risk variants. Relative rate (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of subsequent breast cancer incidence were estimated using multivariable piecewise exponential regression. Results: The analysis included 1,133 female survivors of European ancestry (median age at last follow-up ¼ 35.4 years; range, 8.4–67.4), of whom 47 were diagnosed with one or more subsequent breast cancers (median age at subsequent breast cancer ¼ 40.3 years; range, 24.5–53.0). Adjusting for attained age, age at primary diagnosis, chest irradiation, doses of alkylating agents and anthracy-clines, and genotype eigenvectors, RRs for survivors with PRS in the highest versus lowest quintiles were 2.7 (95% CI, 1.0–7.3), 3.0 (95% CI, 1.1–8.1), and 2.4 (95% CI, 0.1–81.1) for all survivors and survivors with and without chest irradiation, respectively. Similar associations were observed after excluding carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes. Notably, the PRS was associated with the subsequent breast cancer rate under the age of 45 years (RR ¼ 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2–8.3). Conclusions: Genetic profiles comprised of small-effect common variants and large-effect predisposing mutations can inform personalized breast cancer risk and surveillance/intervention in female childhood cancer survivors. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "The study by Jaratlerdsiri and colleagues represents the first whole-genome sequencing study of prostate cancer from men in sub-Saharan Africa. Preliminary findings include a higher tumor mutation burden in these tumors compared with data from other available prostate cancer cohorts. Although larger studies are needed and greater effort and investment to include patients of African ancestry in cancer genomic studies overall, the findings begin to catalog the diversity of prostate cancer genomics in the African population, which has a high burden of disease and mortality from prostate cancer. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are a major component of the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment. CAFs play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis, partly through TGF-b signaling pathway. We investigated whether the TGF-b family coreceptor endoglin is involved in CAF-mediated invasion and metastasis. Experimental Design: CAF-specific endoglin expression was studied in colorectal cancer resection specimens using IHC and related to metastases-free survival. Endoglin-mediated invasion was assessed in vitro by transwell invasion, using primary colorectal cancer–derived CAFs. Effects of CAF-specific endoglin expression on tumor cell invasion were investigated in a colorectal cancer zebrafish model, whereas liver metastases were assessed in a mouse model. Results: CAFs specifically at invasive borders of colorectal cancer express endoglin and increased expression intensity correlated with increased disease stage. Endoglin-expressing CAFs were also detected in lymph node and liver metastases, suggesting a role in colorectal cancer metastasis formation. In stage II colorectal cancer, CAF-specific endoglin expression at invasive borders correlated with poor metastasis-free survival. In vitro experiments revealed that endoglin is indispensable for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-9–induced signaling and CAF survival. Targeting endoglin using the neutralizing antibody TRC105 inhibited CAF invasion in vitro. In zebrafish, endoglin-expressing fibroblasts enhanced colorectal tumor cell infiltration into the liver and decreased survival. Finally, CAF-specific endoglin targeting with TRC105 decreased metastatic spread of colorectal cancer cells to the mouse liver. Conclusions: Endoglin-expressing CAFs contribute to colorectal cancer progression and metastasis. TRC105 treatment inhibits CAF invasion and tumor metastasis, indicating an additional target beyond the angiogenic endothelium, possibly contributing to beneficial effects reported during clinical evaluations. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "The predominant cause of cancer mortality is metastasis. The major impediment to cancer cure is the intrinsic or acquired resistance to currently available therapies. Cancer is heterogeneous at the genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic levels. And, while a molecular-targeted drug may be pathway-precise, it can still fail to achieve wholesome cancer-precise toxicity. In the current review, we discuss the strategic differences between targeting the strengths of cancer cells in phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity and targeting shared vulnerabilities of cancer cells such as the compromised integrity of membranous organelles. To better recapitulate subpopulations of cancer cells in different phenotypic and functional states, we developed a schematic combination of 2-dimensional culture (2D), 3-dimmensional culture in collagen I (3D), and mammosphere culture for stem cells (mammosphere), designated as Scheme 2D/3D/mammosphere. We investigated how the tumor suppressor maspin may limit carcinoma cell plasticity and affect their context-dependent response to drugs of different mechanisms including docetaxel, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MS-275, and ionophore antibiotic salinomycin. We showed that tumor cell phenotypic plasticity is not an exclusive attribute to cancer stem cells. Nonetheless, three subpopulations of prostate cancer cells, enriched through Scheme 2D/3D/mammosphere, show qualitatively different drug responses. Interestingly, salinomycin was the only drug that effectively killed all three cancer cell subpopulations, irrespective of their capacity of stemness. Further, Scheme 2D/3D/mammosphere may be a useful model to accelerate the screening for curative cancer drugs while avoiding costly characterization of compounds that may have only selective toxicity to some, but not all, cancer cell subpopulations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: Ovarian cancer is the most leading cause of deaths among gynecologic malignancies, and Neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) can be upregulated or downregulated according to the type of tumor. However, the expression and function of NRSF in ovarian cancer is still unknown. Main methods: Expression of NRSF in normal ovary and ovarian cancer cells were evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). NRSF expression in normal ovary and ovarian cancer tissue samples were examined by qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). MTT, colony formation, anchorage-independent growth assay were applied to examine the effect of NRSF on ovarian cancer cell proliferation. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and flow cytometry assay were carried out to investigate the role of NRSF on cell cycle of ovarian cancer cells. Luciferase reporter assay and western blotting, immunofluorescence labeling were devoted to explore the mechanism by which NRSF contributes to proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Key findings: The results demonstrated that NRSF is significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cells and tissues and negatively related with the survival of patients with ovarian cancer, and knockout of NRSF inhibit proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Further analysis showed that NRSF can influence G1/S transition of cell cycle via regulating the transcription of Hippo pathway. Significance: Herein, our study suggest that NRSF is associated with the progression of ovarian cancer, and NRSF may be a valuable early detection marker of ovarian cancer and inhibiting NRSF expression may be an effective method to treat ovarian cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "New targets are required for treating prostate cancer, particularly castrate-resistant disease. Previous studies reported that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) expression is increased in human prostate cancer. Here, we show that Camkk2 deletion or pharmacologic inhibition protects against prostate cancer development in a preclinical mouse model that lacks expression of prostate-specific Pten. In contrast, deletion of AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) b1 resulted in earlier onset of adenocarcinoma development. These findings suggest for the first time that Camkk2 and Ampk have opposing effects in prostate cancer progression. Loss of CAMKK2 in vivo or in human prostate cancer cells reduced the expression of two key lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. This reduction was mediated via a posttranscriptional mechanism, potentially involving a decrease in protein translation. Moreover, either deletion of CAMKK2 or activation of AMPK reduced cell growth in human prostate cancer cells by inhibiting de novo lipogenesis. Activation of AMPK in a panel of human prostate cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as androgen-receptor signaling. These findings demonstrate that CAMKK2 and AMPK have opposing effects on lipogenesis, providing a potential mechanism for their contrasting effects on prostate cancer progression in vivo. They also suggest that inhibition of CAMKK2 combined with activation of AMPK would offer an efficacious therapeutic strategy in treatment of prostate cancer. Significance: These findings show that CAMKK2 and its downstream target AMPK have opposing effects on prostate cancer development and raise the possibility of a new combined therapeutic approach that inhibits CAMKK2 and activates AMPK. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Distinguishing aggressive prostate cancer from indolent disease improves personalized treatment. Although only few genetic variants are known to predispose to aggressive prostate cancer, synergistic interactions of HOXB13 G84E high-risk prostate cancer susceptibility mutation with other genetic loci remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the interplay of HOXB13 rs138213197 (G84E) and CIP2A rs2278911 (R229Q) germline variants on prostate cancer risk. Experimental Design: Genotyping was done in Finnish discovery cohort (n ¼ 2,738) and validated in Swedish (n ¼ 3,132) and independent Finnish (n ¼ 1,155) prostate cancer cohorts. Expression pattern analysis was followed by functional studies in prostate cancer cell models. Results: Interplay of HOXB13 (G84E) and CIP2A (R229Q) variants results in highest observed inherited prostate cancer risk (OR, 21.1; P ¼ 0.000024). In addition, this synergism indicates a significant association of HOXB13 T and CIP2A T dual carriers with elevated risk for high Gleason score (OR, 2.3; P ¼ 0.025) and worse prostate cancer–specific life expectancy (HR, 3.9; P ¼ 0.048), and it is linked with high PSA at diagnosis (OR, 3.30; P ¼ 0.028). Furthermore, combined high expression of HOXB13-CIP2A correlates with earlier biochemical recurrence. Finally, functional experiments showed that ectopic expression of variants stimulates prostate cancer cell growth and migration. In addition, we observed strong chromatin binding of HOXB13 at CIP2A locus and revealed that HOXB13 functionally promotes CIP2A transcription. The study is limited to retrospective Nordic cohorts. Conclusions: Simultaneous presence of HOXB13 T and CIP2A T alleles confers for high prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness of disease, earlier biochemical relapse, and lower disease-specific life expectancy. HOXB13 protein binds to CIP2A gene and functionally promotes CIP2A transcription. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, but its molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. The tumor suppressor candidate 3 (TUSC3) gene is located on chromosome 8p22 and is universally acknowledged as a cancer suppressor. However, our research has demonstrated that TUSC3 expression is significantly upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer compared to benign controls. In this study, we analyzed the consequences of TUSC3 knockdown or overexpression on the biological functions of non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines. To identify the molecules and signaling pathways with which TUSC3 might interact, we completed immunoblotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, microarray, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence assays. We demonstrated that TUSC3 knockdown leads to decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion, and reduced xenograft tumor growth of non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, whereas opposite results were observed with overexpression of TUSC3. In addition, TUSC3 knockdown suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition by downregulating the expression of claudin-1, which plays an indispensable role in EMT progress. On the contrary, overexpression of TUSC3 significantly enhanced EMT progress by upregulating claudin-1 expression. Overall, our observations suggest that TUSC3 accelerates cancer growth and induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-small-cell lung cancer cells; we also identified claudin-1 as a target of TUSC3. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Targeting PARP1 for synthetic lethality is a new strategy for breast cancers harboring germline mutations in BRCA. However, these mutations are rare, and reactivation of BRCA-mediated pathways may result in eventual resistance to PARP1 inhibitor therapy. Alternative synthetic lethality approaches targeting more common sporadic breast cancers and preinvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable. Here we show that downregulation of XRCC1, which interacts with PARP1 and coordinates base excision repair, is an early event in human breast cancer pathogenesis. XRCC1-deficient DCIS were aggressive and associated with increased risk of local recurrence. Human invasive breast cancers deficient in XRCC1 and expressing high PARP1 levels also manifested aggressive features and poor outcome. The PARP1 inhibitor olaparib was synthetically lethal in XRCC1-deficient DCIS and invasive breast cancer cells. We conclude that targeting PARP1 is an attractive strategy for synthetic lethality and chemoprevention in XRCC1-deficient breast cancers, including preinvasive DCIS. Significance: These findings show that loss of XRCC1, which is associated with more malignant DCIS, can be exploited by PARP inhibition, suggesting its application as a promising therapeutic and chemoprevention strategy in XRCC1-deficient tumor cells. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is required for normal mammary gland development and biology. A PTHLH gene polymorphism is associated with breast cancer risk, and PTHrP promotes growth of osteolytic breast cancer bone metastases. Accordingly, current dogma holds that PTHrP is upregulated in malignant primary breast tumors, but solid evidence for this assumption is missing. Experimental Design: We used quantitative IHC to measure PTHrP in normal and malignant breast epithelia, and correlated PTHrP levels in primary breast cancer with clinical outcome. Results: PTHrP levels were markedly downregulated in malignant compared with normal breast epithelia. Moreover, low levels of nuclear localized PTHrP in cancer cells correlated with unfavorable clinical outcome in a test and a validation cohort of breast cancer treated at different institutions totaling nearly 800 cases. PTHrP mRNA levels in tumors of a third cohort of 737 patients corroborated this association, also after multivariable adjustment for standard clinicopathologic parameters. Breast cancer PTHrP levels correlated strongly with transcription factors Stat5a/b, which are established markers of favorable prognosis and key mediators of prolactin signaling. Prolactin stimulated PTHrP transcript and protein in breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo, effects mediated by Stat5 through the P2 gene promoter, producing transcript AT6 encoding the PTHrP 1-173 isoform. Low levels of AT6, but not two alternative transcripts, correlated with poor clinical outcome. Conclusions: This study overturns the prevailing view that PTHrP is upregulated in primary breast cancers and identifies a direct prolactin–Stat5–PTHrP axis that is progressively lost in more aggressive tumors. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Using objectively collected physical activity (PA) data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the authors tested whether patterns of daily activity and sedentary time differed by cancer survivorship in older adults. Methods: In total, 659 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 71 ± 10 years; 51% women) who had self-reported information on cancer history were instructed to wear an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Accelerometer data were summarized into: 1) PA volume and 2) activity fragmentation (interrupted activity), expressed as both continuous and as dichotomized (low and high) variables. Participants were categorized into 4 groups by cross-classification of dichotomous PA volume and fragmentation. Multiple regression models were used to estimate differences in PA patterns by cancer history. Results: Cancer survivors averaged 0.12 fewer log-transformed activity counts per day (standard error, 0.05; P =.02) than individuals who reported no history of cancer after adjusting for demographics, behavioral factors, and comorbidities. Although fragmentation did not differ by cancer survivorship in the continuous model (P =.13), cancer survivorship was associated with 77% greater odds (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.82) of having high (vs low) fragmentation and 94% greater odds (odds ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.33) of having combined low PA/high fragmentation (vs high PA/low fragmentation) relative to those with no cancer history. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that cancer survivors engage in lower total daily PA and that they perform this activity in a more fragmented manner compared with adults without a history of cancer. These results may reflect the onset and progression of a low-activity phenotype that is more vulnerable to heightened levels of fatigue and functional decline with aging. © 2018 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Although increasing aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified among many human cancer tissues, their roles in tumor progression still remain largely unknown. In bladder cancer, the function of hsa_circ_0000144 has not been reported. In our study, we found hsa_circ_0000144 as a novel oncogene in bladder cancer by bioinformatics analysis. We found that hsa_circ_0000144 expression was significantly upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and its high expression was related with poor prognosis. Additionally, knockdown of hsa_circ_0000144 remarkably suppressed the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells in vitro. Hsa_circ_0000144 silence also led to reduced tumor volumes in vivo. In mechanism, we found that hsa_circ_0000144 was a sponge of miR-217 while miR-217 targeted RUNX2. Our results indicated that the expression of miR-217 was inversely correlated with that of both hsa_circ_0000144 and RUNX2 in bladder cancer tissues. Rescue assays showed that either inhibition of miR-217 or restoration of RUNX2 reversed the suppressive effects of hsa_circ_0000144 knockdown on bladder cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that hsa_circ_0000144 exerts oncogenic roles in bladder cancer via repressing miR-217 to facilitate RUNX2 expression. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although the proportion of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) diagnosed among older women is low, the number of TNBC cases is substantial because of the high incidence of breast cancer after the age of 65 years. The molecular features of TNBC in this age group have not been well described. Methods: This study examined a population-based cohort of women with stage I to III TNBC diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 91 years with the PAM50 gene expression subtyping assay. The concordance between the TNBC classification by immunohistochemistry and the gene expression classification by PAM50, the expression of individual genes, and 5-year recurrence and breast cancer mortality in older women (≥65 years old) and younger women (<50 years old) was assessed. Results: The molecular subtype distribution in TNBC was significantly different according to the age at diagnosis. TNBC was more likely to be classified as basal-like in women younger than 50 years (sensitivity, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.97) than women 65 years old or older (sensitivity, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.87); 35% of clinical TNBC cases in the latter group were the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–enriched subtype by molecular classification. Older women with TNBC also had significantly higher expression of ERBB2 and lower expression of all 10 proliferation-associated genes tested (P <.01). The risk of breast cancer death within 5 years was significantly higher in women with TNBC in comparison with women with hormone receptor–positive cancers in all age groups. Conclusions: This study revealed differences in molecular subtypes among clinical TNBC cases based on patient age. A potentially targetable HER2-enriched group raises the possible need for intrinsic subtyping in older women with TNBC. © 2018 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Curcumin is a widely researched and utilized natural product used for a variety of ailments, including as a gastrointestinal aide and an anticancer agent. Curcumin, however, suffers from poor bioavailability. A strategy to circumvent poor bioavailability is to administer with an adjuvant or by synthetic modification. Herein, we demonstrate the incorporation of curcumin into a self-degradable polymer by condensation with N,N′-di-Boc-L-cystine. The polymer is made self-degradable upon deprotection of the cystine amines. Degradation is confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Curcumin retains its anti-cancer activity within the polymer showing activity against HT29 human colon cancer cells and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. The self-degrading polymer showed enhanced activity against HT29 cells compared to that of curcumin. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

    "Abstract": "Background: Ovarian cancer is poorly immunogenic; however, increased major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) expression correlates with improved immune response and prolonged survival in patients with ovarian cancer. The authors previously demonstrated that the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat increases MHCII expression on ovarian cancer cells. In the current study, they evaluated whether entinostat treatment and resultant MHCII expression would enhance beneficial immune responses and impair tumor growth in mice with ovarian cancer. Methods: C57BL/6 mice bearing intraperitoneal ID8 tumors were randomized to receive entinostat 20 mg/kg daily versus control. Changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of 46 genes important for antitumor immunity were evaluated using NanoString analysis, and multicolor flow cytometry was used to measure changes in protein expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Results: Entinostat treatment decreased the growth of both subcutaneously and omental ID8 tumors and prolonged survival in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. NanoString analysis revealed significant changes in mRNA expression in 21 of 46 genes, including increased expression of the MHCI pathway, the MHCII transactivator (CIITA), interferon γ, and granzyme B. C57BL/6 mice that received entinostat had increased MHCII expression on omental tumor cells and a higher frequency of tumor-infiltrating, CD8-positive T cells by flow cytometry. In immunocompromised mice, treatment with entinostat had no effect on tumor size and did not increase MHCII expression. Conclusions: In the current murine ovarian cancer model, entinostat treatment enhances beneficial immune responses. Moreover, these antitumor effects of entinostat are dependent on an intact immune system. Future studies combining entinostat with checkpoint inhibitors or other immunomodulatory agents may achieve more durable antitumor responses in patients with ovarian cancer. © 2018 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Background: Older patients with cancer are at risk for increased side effects of treatment. Our goal was to inform treatment for older patients by analyzing the relationship between chemotherapy regimen and hospitalization among older women receiving palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer. Method: We identified women aged 66-99 years with stage IV de novo breast cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2013 who received any of the 10 most common cytotoxic chemotherapy-containing regimens in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. The primary outcome was hospitalization or death within 30 days of starting a new line of chemotherapy. Generalized linear mixed effects models with patient-specific random effects were used for multivariable analysis of the association between chemotherapy regimen and this outcome. Additional covariates included number of prior lines of therapy; time since diagnosis; hormone receptor and HER2 status; sites of metastatic disease; and age, race, and marital status. The unit of analysis was each new line of chemotherapy. Results: Of 972 lines of chemotherapy initiated among 693 patients, 188 (19%) were followed by hospitalization or death within 30 days. After adjustment, there was significant variation in this outcome by chemotherapy regimen (P =.03); compared with capecitabine, hospitalization/death rates were higher with cyclophosphamide + docetaxel (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-5.59), cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.19-5.03), docetaxel (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.19-5.21), and gemcitabine (OR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.72-7.19). Conclusion: Treatment regimen was associated with significant variation in 30-day hospitalization or death among older women receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for stage IV de novo breast cancer. © 2018 American Cancer Society",

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to perform important roles in cancer development. Previously, we have shown that lncRNA gastric cancer-associated transcript 3 (GACAT3) is overexpressed in gastric cancer and acts as a downstream target of interleukin 6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/STAT3) signaling. However, the role of GACAT3 in regulating gastric cancer cell growth remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that GACAT3 acts as a competing endogenous RNA of high mobility group A1 (HMGA1), a typical oncogene that is overexpressed in most types of cancer, based on a search for common miRNA-binding sites and on experiments involving in vitro cell transfection with synthesized miRNA mimics. Furthermore, knockdown of GACAT3 by its specific siRNA resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells, similar to the effect of an HMGA1 knockdown. Moreover, GACAT3 overexpression alleviated the apoptosis induced by cucurbitacin B, which is a widely used anticancer drug. Mechanistically, GACAT3 amplified STAT3 expression and decreased the level of the apoptosis gene bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). Thus, our study provides fundamental information regarding GACAT3, which could be a valuable target for gastric cancer therapy. © 2018",
