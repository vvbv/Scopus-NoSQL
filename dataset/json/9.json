    "Abstract": "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) FOXD2 adjacent opposite strand RNA 1 (FOXD2-AS1) has been shown to be dysregulated in several types of human cancer. However, the role of FOXD2-AS1 in cutaneous melanoma was still unclear. In our study, FOXD2-AS1 expression has been found to be upregulated in cutaneous melanoma tissue specimens and cell lines compared with that in normal tissue specimens and normal human epidermal melanocyte, respectively. Furthermore, high expression of FOXD2-AS1 was obviously correlated with deep Breslow thickness, present ulceration, high Clark level and distant metastasis in cutaneous melanoma patients. However, there were no statistical associations between FOXD2-AS1 expression and cutaneous melanoma patients’ disease-free survival and overall survival. The results of loss-of-function study showed that inhibition of FOXD2-AS1 suppresses cutaneous melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion through regulating phospho-Akt expression. In conclusion, FOXD2-AS1 is associated with clinical progression in cutaneous melanoma patients, and functions as oncogenic lncRNA in cutaneous melanoma cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Though the advancement of chemotherapy drugs alleviates the progress of cancer, long-term therapy with anticancer agents gradually leads to acquired multidrug resistance (MDR), which limits the survival outcomes in patients. It was shown that dihydromyricetin (DMY) could partly reverse MDR by suppressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein (SORCIN) independently. To reverse MDR more effectively, a new strategy was raised, that is, circumventing MDR by the coadministration of DMY and ondansetron (OND), a common antiemetic drug, during cancer chemotherapy. Meanwhile, the interior relation between P-gp and SORCIN was also revealed. The combination of DMY and OND strongly enhanced antiproliferative efficiency of adriamycin (ADR) because of the increasing accumulation of ADR in K562/ADR-resistant cell line. DMY could downregulate the expression of SORCIN and P-gp via the ERK/Akt pathways, whereas OND could not. In addition, it was proved that SORCIN suppressed ERK and Akt to inhibit P-gp by the silence of SORCIN, however, not vice versa. Finally, the combination of DMY, OND, and ADR led to G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via resuming P53 function and restraining relevant proteins expression. These fundamental findings provided a promising approach for further treatment of MDR. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid and simple detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can enable early diagnosis and improve prognosis in cancer patients. Here, we fabricated luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH)-conjugated surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tags to detect CTCs expressing LHRH receptors (LHRHRs) in mouse blood. With optimization, 50 μM 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (pMBA) as reporter molecule and 20 μl of 20 mg/ml reduced bovine serum albumin(rBSA) as protecting layer resulted in the most stable SERS tag suspension. Cultures of HeLa cells, which overexpress LHRHRs, were then used to evaluate the selectivity, sensitivity, and cytotoxicity. Mouse blood was spiked with or without HeLa cells were used to test the practical application of our SERS tag-mediated CTC detection method. In consequence, CTCs can be rapidly detected in the mouse blood in a specific and sensitive manner down to the 5 cells/ml CTC concentration. Additionally, a good linear relationship was observed between CTC concentration and signal intensity. Therefore, this inexpensive method using LHRH-targeting SERS tags rapidly detects CTCs and could prove to be a novel platform for point-of-care testing in cancer patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Network-based approaches to identifying gene expression signatures of disease have been shown to be more reproducible, accurate, and biologically informative than single-gene markers. Differential expression statistics are most commonly used to rank and select nodes within biological networks. Disease heterogeneity and disease-specific mechanisms may create changes in gene expression distributions that are not captured by differential expression analysis. We implemented a disease network identification algorithm using four unique statistical metrics, based on changes in mean expression, expression variance, and overall expression distribution changes. Using three publicly available gene expression datasets, we evaluated the size, strength, and disease classification performance of the identified subnetworks in cancer and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) cohorts. Identified subnetworks for all three datasets had significant enrichment of disease signal over individual genes, based on p-value. Further, novel and unique subnetworks were identified by each statistical metric, including changes in expression variance related to BRCA1 in breast cancer, and changes in blood coagulation in PTSD. Subnetwork-based biomarkers also slightly improved prediction performance over individual gene markers. This approach could provide a novel network-based framework for understanding and predicting gene expression signals of disease. © 2017 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Oxidative stress and reactivation of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) are coincidently observed in bladder cancer (BlCa), but the mechanistic connection between these two oncogenic phenomena is unknown. Previously, we reported increases in oxidative stress and LINE-1 protein (ORF1p) expression in human BlCa tissues. In this study, we measured 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-oxoguanosine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), H3K9me3 and HP1α in bladder tissues obtained from BlCa patients. Reactivation of LINE-1 by reactive oxygen species (ROS) through chromatin remodeling was investigated in seven BlCa cell lines. We found that 5mC was decreased, but 8-OHdG, H3K9me3 and HP1α levels were increased in BlCa tissues relative to the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. OGG1, H3K9me3 and HP1α expression in BlCa tissues were positively correlated with 8-OHdG levels. Following H 2 O 2 treatment, LINE-1 transcript expression was increased in VM-CUB-1 and TCCSUP, whereas AluYa5 and AluYb8 transcripts were increased in BFTC905 cells. Basal expression of LINE-1 ORF1p varied among BlCa cell lines from none to very high. H 2 O 2 treatment clearly increased expression of ORF1p in VM-CUB-1, TCCSUP and BFTC905. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that 5′-LINE-1 promoters became further enriched in H3K4me3 and H3K18ac in VM-CUB-1 and BFTC905 cells treated with H 2 O 2 . In contrast, 5′-LINE-1 promoters became more enriched in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in UM-UC-3 treated with H 2 O 2 . In summary, decreased 5mC, but increased 8-OHdG, H3K9me3 and HP1α expression were demonstrated in human BlCa tissues, indicating global DNA hypomethylation, increased oxidative stress and altered histone methylation in BlCa. Chromatin structures were profoundly changed in BlCa cells exposed to ROS, but expression of LINE-1 transcript and protein were at most modestly increased. ROS enhanced expression of full-length LINE-1 elements only in cell lines with pre-existing activation, which was paralleled by increased formation of active chromatin at LINE-1 promoter loci. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: The present study deals with the hyperthermia therapy, which is the type of treatment in which tissues are exposed to high temperatures in order to destroy cancer cells with minimal injury to healthy tissues. In particular, it focuses on glioblastoma multiform, which is the most aggressive cancer that begins within the brain. Conventional treatments display limitations that can be overcome by using nanoparticles for targeted heating. Out of the proposed nanoparticles, this investigation focuses on a new field that utilizes carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which are able to selectively heat the cancer cells since they can convert near infrared light into heat. In the absence of any experiment or theoretical model for the estimation of an effective thermal conductivity of blood and CNTs, a first principle model is developed in this study which takes into account the blood micro-structure. Besides, a number of factors are included, namely the shape and the size of the nanoparticles, the interfacial layer formed around them and their volume fraction. Methods: Firstly, assuming that the blood consists of blood cells and plasma, the thermal conductivity of the former is estimated. Then, the effective thermal conductivity of plasma/CNTs is calculated for various parameters. Finally, the resulting “bio-nanofluid” consisting of plasma/CNTs and blood cells is formed. Results: It is ascertained that thin and elongated CNTs with relatively large nanolayer thickness as well as large concentrations of CNTs contribute to the increase of the thermal conductivity and, thus, in the enhancement of the heat transfer. Conclusions: Investigating of how design parameters pertaining to CNTs, such as their size and shape, affect the effective thermal conductivity of blood-CNTs, possible regulating ways are suggested regarding the hyperthermic treatment. Finally, the present simple estimation of the effective thermal conductivity can be used as an effective property of the nanofluid when it comes to numerical investigations regarding heat transfer occurring during hyperthermia or other potential clinical uses (for example targeted heat of living tissues). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "PM 2.5 -bound PAHs are ubiquitous in urban atmospheres and are characterized as carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic upon inhalation. A total of 218 daily PM 2.5 samples were collected during one year in the urban district of Beijing, China. Analysis showed that the annual mean concentration of total PAHs (TPAHs) was 66.2 ng/m 3 , with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) accounting for 12.4%. High-molecular-weight (HMW, 4–6 rings) PAHs were the dominant components. Seasonal TPAH concentrations decreased in the order of heating season (156 ng/m 3 ) &gt; autumn (20.4 ng/m 3 ) &gt; spring (16.0 ng/m 3 ) &gt; summer (12.5 ng/m 3 ) and were related to meteorological conditions and source emission intensity. The source-attributed mass contribution and source regions of three sources (i.e., (1) vehicle emissions; (2) coal combustion; and (3) petroleum volatilization, natural gas and biomass combustion) were identified by integrating the positive matrix factorization (PMF), potential source contribution function (PSCF) and conditional probability function (CPF). Vehicle emissions contributed the most mass (54.6%), followed by coal combustion (29.8%), on an annual basis. Combined with actual regional emissions, vehicle emissions were mainly derived from local sources, while coal combustion mainly came from regional transport from surrounding areas. Vehicle emissions and coal combustion have much higher mass contributions in the heating season. The source-attributed cancer risk was further evaluated based on source mass contribution and inhalation unit risk. Vehicle emissions contributed the largest risk (2.8 × 10 −6 , accounting for 71%) as a result of 30 years of exposure for local residents, exceeding the acceptable level (10 −6 ). The heating season showed the most risk, especially in response to vehicle emissions and coal combustion. Overall, the source-attributed cancer risk was regarded as the better index for the development of a control strategy of PM 2.5 -bound PAHs for protecting residents. Based on this index, priority control sources in each season were identified to supply a more effective management solution. © 2018 Elsevier LtdAn integrated PMF-PSCF–CPF model was proposed to decrease the uncertainty of quantitative source apportionment of PM 2.5 -bound PAHs and identify potential source regions, and source-attributed health risk was suggested as a better index than mass contribution for ranking priority control sources of PM 2.5 -bound PAHs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The interaction of multiple myeloma (MM) cells with macrophages (MΦs) contributes to the pathophysiology of MM. We previously showed that IL-32 is overexpressed in MM patients. The present study was designed to explore the clinical significance of IL-32 in MM and to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the IL-32-mediated immune function of MΦs. Our results showed that high IL-32 expression in MM patients was associated with more advanced clinical stage. RNA-sequencing revealed that IL-32γ significantly induced the production of the immunosuppressive molecule indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in MΦs, and this effect was verified by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, MM cells with IL-32-knockdown showed a reduced ability to promote IDO expression. As a binding protein for IL-32, proteinase 3 (PR3) was universally expressed on the surfaces of MΦs, and knockdown of PR3 or inhibition of the STAT3 and NF-κB pathways hindered the IL-32γ-mediated stimulation of IDO expression. Finally, IDO-positive IL-32γ-educated MΦs inhibited CD4 + T cell proliferation and IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α production. Taken together, our results indicate that IL-32γ derived from MM cells promotes the immunosuppressive function of MΦs and is a potential target for MM treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Preclinical efficacy and toxicity assessment of drug candidates plays a significant role in drug discovery and development. Traditional planar cell culture is a common way to perform the preclinical drug test, but it is difficult to correctly predict the drug efficacy and toxicity due to the simple two-dimensional (2D) extracellular microenvironment. Compared to the planar cell culture, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system can better mimic the complex extracellular microenvironment where cells reside in the 3D tissues/organs in vivo. However, the conventional imaging techniques are difficult to achieve the dynamic and label-free monitoring of cellular behavior in thick sample by 3D cell culture. Here, 3D electric cell/matrigel-substrate impedance sensing (3D-ECMIS) is developed for real-time and non-invasive monitoring of 3D cell viability and drug susceptibility. In this study, human hepatoma cells (HepG2) are encapsulated in the matrigel scaffold and cultured in a 3D ECMIS chip which involves a pair of vertical golden electrodes on the opposite sidewalls of the culture chamber for the in-situ impedance measurement. Moreover, a portable multichannel system is developed to monitor the 3D cell/matrigel construct. The number of 3D-cultured cells was inversely proportional to the impedance magnitude of the entire cell/matrigel construct. Furthermore, anti-cancer drug screening will be conducted on the 3D-cultured cells when the cell proliferation reaches to a plateau phase. To validate the performance of 3D-ECMIS for the cell viability and drug susceptibility, the cell live/dead staining are utilized to confirm the results of drug susceptibility by this 3D-cell-based biosensor system. It is demonstrated that the 3D cell-based biosensor and 3D-ECMIS system will be a promising platform to improve the accuracy of cell-based anti-cancer drug screening in vitro. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Layered metal hydroxides have exhibited remarkable benefits in drug delivery, days or even weeks of continuous drug release with improved bioavailability and minimized adverse effects. Here, we report synthesis of a new M+ (Na+) and M2+ (Ca2+) layered double metal hydroxide-based phases with the general formula of [Na0.2Ca0.8(OH)1.4] (NO3)0.4, and 3D pseudo-hexagonal morphology. NaCa layered double metal hydroxide (NaCa-LDH), which is biodegradable, biocompatible, and pH-sensitive, could have broad applicability in drug release and other biomedical applications. Dacarbazine (DAC) is one of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs for treating various cancers. However, its poor water solubility, short half-life in blood circulation, low response rate and high side effects limit its application. This study aimed to increase its half-life and anticancer activity; minimize its side effects; and prolong its drug release by intercalating of DAC in biodegradable NaCa-LDH (DAC-LDH). Results from the intercalation process show that NaCa-LDH is able to intercalate DAC with a simple procedure and with a good drug loading (38% w/w) through a one pot reaction. The DAC shows a sustained and pH-sensitive release, and the release rate of DAC from DAC-LDH at pH 7.4 is remarkably lower than that at pH 6.0 due to its different release mechanisms. In the latter case, the release was not complete at 24 h. We show that DAC-LDH anticancer efficacy on malignant (A-375) melanoma and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines is higher than that of free DAC. These nanoparticles may open a significant way toward the development of a pH-sensitive drug release system that minimizes drug side effect for a wide range of applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Gut microbiome plays a dominant role in modulating therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death receptor/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway, suggesting that co-administration of antibiotics (Abx), which might result in dysbacteriosis, can attenuate the clinical outcomes of ICIs. The current study aimed to investigate the predictive role of Abx on ICIs treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The impact of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), another medication that can induce dysbacteriosis, was also investigated. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of eligible patients who received anti-PD-1-based therapies in our hospital. Tumor responses, patients’ survival, the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and other baseline variables were examined. The application of Abx or PPIs treatment were also collected. Clinical outcomes and clinicopathologic features were compared according to the status of Abx or PPIs co-administration. Results: A total of 109 patients were included. Of them, 20 (18.3%) patients were categorized in Abx-treated group. No major difference in baseline characteristics was observed between Abx-treated and -untreated groups. Concomitant Abx treatment was significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p < 0.0001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0021). And primary disease progression tended to increase in Abx-treated group (p = 0.092). Yet, the occurrence and grades of irAEs were comparable between two groups. In multivariable analysis, Abx treatment was markedly associated with worse PFS (HR=0.32, 95%CI 0.18-0.59, p < 0.0001) and OS (HR=0.35, 95%CI 0.16-0.77, p = 0.009). Regarding the use of PPIs, no significant difference was observed in clinical outcomes between the patients with or without concomitant PPIs treatment. Conclusions: Abx treatment was significantly associated with attenuated clinical outcomes derived from anti-PD-1-based ICIs in a Chinese cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objectives: There is interest in using sequential multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to assess men on active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) recommendations propose standardised reporting mpMRI data for these men. This includes accurate size measurements of lesions over time, but such approach is time consuming for the radiologist and there is a strong need of dedicated tools to report serial scans in a systematic manner. We present the results from an initial validation cohort using dedicated PRECISE reporting software to allow automated comparison between sequential scans on AS. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analysed baseline and follow-up scans of 20 men randomised to 6 months of daily dutasteride (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) from the MAPPED trial. Men underwent 3T mpMRI at baseline and after 6 months, and a dedicated radiologist reported the scans using both a widespread commercially-available platform (Osirix®) and a semi-automated dedicated PRECISE reporting tool (MIM®). Tumour volume by planimetry in all sequences and conspicuity on diffusion-weighted imaging were assessed. Reporting time was recorded, and we used the Wilcoxon test for statistical analysis. Results: Median tumour volumes and conspicuity were similar using both approaches. The reporting time of the follow-up scan was quicker using the PRECISE reporting workflow both in the whole population (12′33″ vs 10′52″; p = 0.005) and in the dutasteride arm (15′50″ vs 12′59″; p = 0.01). A structured report including clinical and imaging data was generated according to the PRECISE recommendations and a comparison table between lesion characteristics at baseline and follow-up scans was also included. Conclusion: We conclude that a dedicated PRECISE reporting tool for sequential scans in men on AS results in a significant reduction in the reporting time and allows the radiologist to easily compare scans over time. This tool will help with our understanding of the natural history of mpMRI changes during AS. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Characteristics of indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their health risks were investigated in kitchens and bedrooms during the heating season in rural Guanzhong Plain, China. Toxic-VOC concentrations in kitchens with traditional wood (299 ± 38.8 μg m −3 ) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves (187 ± 54.6 μg m −3 ) were considerably higher than those in bedrooms. High levels of toxic VOCs in traditional kitchens were strongly correlated with wood combustion (R = 0.72). The coefficient of determination of VOC profiles between the kitchen and wood combustion was 0.27, indicating that VOCs in traditional kitchens are mainly derived from wood combustion. For women, who do most of the cooking, noncancer risk from exposure to toxic VOCs could reach 7600 and 2550 in traditional and LPG kitchens, respectively. Noncancer risks were much lower in bedrooms than in kitchens, but still two orders of magnitude higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) threshold. Cancer risk from exposure to VOCs for women was 8.98 × 10 −4 and 1.67 × 10 −4 in both traditional and LPG kitchens, respectively, and ranged from 2.51 × 10 −6 to 3.85 × 10 −5 in bedrooms—all exceeding the USEPA threshold. Thus, during the heating season indicated that the rural Guanzhong residents were exposed to toxic VOCs from indoor heating and cooking at levels higher than the recommended safety levels. Moreover, traditional cooking and heating styles in rural Guanzhong need to be urgently updated to improve the indoor air quality for residents. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "In the current study, cytocompatible in situ cross-linkable pH/thermo-dual responsive injectable hydrogels were prepared based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and carboxymethyl chitosan, i.e., poly(CMCS-g-NIPAAm). The prepared formulations were aimed to be used as drug depot of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) after subcutaneous administration in vivo. The phase transition from sol-gel state under physiologic temperature range was analyzed and confirmed by tube titling and optical transmittance measurements. The viscoelastic properties of gel formulations were confirmed by rheology determination via time sweep, temperature, and continuous ramp test. Oscillatory swelling cycles confirmed temperature effect and structural changes. pH and temperature sensitivity of dual responsive gels were analyzed at different pH and temperature programs. In vitro drug release profile displayed that developed formulations have the highest release in acidic pH at 25°C. The safety of blank gel formulations was evaluated against L929 cell lines via MTT assay and confirmed cytocompatibility with no detectable toxicity. In vitro cytotoxic potential of drug-loaded gels against HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cell lines confirmed that 5-FU has controlled cytotoxic potential in depot form in comparison to free 5-FU solution. The IC 50 values for free 5-FU (21 ± 05 μg/ml and 18 ± 66 μg/ml) were found higher in comparison to the loaded form. The copolymer structure formation was confirmed by NMR and FTIR spectroscopic analysis. TG and DSC analysis proved the thermal stability and phase transition temperatures of pure and copolymer samples, while SEM analysis showed the porous nature of in situ formed hydrogels. It was concluded from the results that the developed formulations have pH/temperature sensitivity with potential of systemic and intratumoral controlled drug delivery properties. © 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Sequential combination of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and chemotherapy has shown greater benefits than either treatment alone in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this follow-up of the ENSURE study, we evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) with first-line erlotinib followed by chemotherapy at progression versus the inverse treatment sequence in 175 Chinese patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Materials and methods: Forty-five of the 175 patients included in the follow-up analysis experienced progressive disease (PD). Those with PD on first-line erlotinib (n = 24) received gemcitabine/cisplatin while those who failed first-line chemotherapy (n = 21) received erlotinib until second-line PD. The primary endpoint was PFS in the crossover subpopulation. Post-hoc analysis of survival outcomes was also measured for the overall population of 175 Chinese patients. Results: Among patients who crossed over at progression, PFS was comparable between those who received second-line erlotinib and those who received second-line chemotherapy (median, 26.3 months and 23.4 months, respectively; P = 0.529). Regardless of the sequence in which the therapies were administered, patients in the crossover treatment subgroup benefited from either second-line therapy after progression with a median overall survival of 51.6 months versus 23.0 months achieved among patients in the non-crossover treatment subgroup. Post-hoc biomarker analyses of Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox regression showed that survival benefits with either treatment sequence were similar between patients with circulating free DNA EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21; however, those with undetectable mutations achieved significantly greater survival benefits. Conclusion: In advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, first-line erlotinib followed by chemotherapy at progression demonstrated comparable PFS benefit with the inverse treatment sequence, irrespective of mutation subtype. Utilizing both EGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy, irrespective of the sequence, maximizes survival benefits for patients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer testis (CT) antigens are expressed in various types of tumors and represent the potential targets for T cell-based immunotherapy. Analysis of CT gene expression and DNA methylation have indicated that certain CT genes are epigenetically regulated and studies have confirmed that certain CT antigens are regulated by DNA methylation. In this study, we explored the epigenetic regulation of MAGE-A3 and improved the clinical outcome of MAGE-A3-specific T cell therapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We used molecular profiling datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas to analyze CT gene expression in ESCC and its regulation by DNA methylation. We performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and bisulfite sequencing in ESCC cell lines and ESCC tissues. Functional assays, such as flow cytometry, cytotoxicity assays and ELISA, were performed to determine the demethylation agent, decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, DAC)-treated cancer cell improved antigen specific T cells response. ESCC tumor cell-xenograft mouse model and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays were used to determine the function of DAC treatment in enhancing anti-MAGE-3 T cell responses in ESCC. Furthermore, we performed qRT-PCR and flow cytometry in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. MAGE-A3, one of the CT antigens, expressed at various levels in ESCC and was interfered by DNA methylation. We observed an efficient increase in MAGE-A3 expression in tumor cells and tissues after the treatment of decitabine and the expression of MAGE-A3 was affected by DNA methylation. Functional assays showed enhanced secretion of IFN-γ and cytolysis of MAGE-A3 antigen-specific T cells by DAC-treated target cells. In the tumor cell-xenograft mouse model and ELISPOT assays, DAC increased the expression of MAGE-A3 and T cell mediated tumor clearance in ESCC as well. Notably, the proportions of MAGE-A3-responsive T cells were elevated in DAC-treated patients with MDS, indicating DAC dismissed the epigenetic inhibition of MAGE-A3. DAC would probably improve the clinical outcome of MAGE-A3-specific T cell therapy by augmenting the expression of target gene. © 2019 The Authors",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) within the first 48 h after ICU admission are associated with prognostic indicators (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, Charlson comorbidity index [CCI]), clinical complications, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, mechanical ventilation duration, and mortality. Methods: Seventy-one patients were admitted to the ICU, and their concentrations of 25(OH)D in the first 48 h were analyzed. To evaluate the prognostic factors in the ICU, APACHE II scores, SOFA scores, CCI questionnaires, mechanical ventilation time, CRP, and mortality were used. Results: The mean concentration of 25(OH)D was 17.7 ± 8.27 ng/mL (range 3.5–37.5 ng/mL), with 91.6% presenting with deficiency at admission. Although no associations were found between serum 25(OH)D concentrations with mechanical ventilation time, CRP, mortality, and APACHE II and SOFA severity scores, we found associations with the CCI when adjusted by age (model 1: odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14–2.34) and by age, sex and body mass index (model 2: OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10–2.34). In addition, among the comorbidities present, 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with cancer (crude model OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.21–9.64) and liver disease (crude model OR, 9.64; 95% CI, 2.28–40.60). Conclusion: We found a strong association between 25(OH)D concentrations and the prognostic indicator CCI and clinical complications (acute respiratory insufficiency, acute liver failure, and infections), but no associations with the prognostic indicators APACHE II and SOFA score, CRP, mechanical ventilation duration, or mortality. The main comorbidities associated with low 25(OH)D were cancer and liver disease, suggesting that the determination of 25(OH)vitamin D is relevant during the ICU stay. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "High expression of special AT-rich-binding protein 1 (SATB1) correlates with the advanced TNM stage and short overall and recurrence-free survival of gastric cancer (GC). A bioinformatic analysis revealed that SATB1 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) and long noncoding RNA UCA1 (lncRNA-UCA1) might competitively bind to microRNA-495-3p (miR-495-3p). Interestingly, lncRNA-UCA1 is also an important contributor to GC. The current study aimed to demonstrate the potential interaction among SATB1/miR-495-3p/lncRNA-UCA1 network and their effects on GC proliferation and invasion. The expression in GC and paracancerous normal tissues were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down, and transfection assays were performed to determine the interaction among SATB1/miR-495-3p/lncRNA-UCA1 network in GC cells. GC proliferation and invasion were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, transwell invasion, and colony formation assays. Results showed higher expression of SATB1 and lncRNA-UCA1 but lower miR-495-3p expression in GC than in the normal tissues. In luciferase reporter assay, miR-495-3p bound to three seed sequences in SATB1 3′-UTR but only one in lncRNA-UCA1. SATB1 knockdown increased the combination of miR-495-3p with lncRNA-UCA1 but decreased lncRNA-UCA1 expression. Decreased lncRNA-UCA1 was also observed with the mimics increased miR-495-3p. These data suggested that SATB1 3′-UTR functions as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-495-3p and positively regulates lncRNA-UCA1. LncRNA-UCA1 knockdown only decreased SATB1 expression in MKN-45 cells but not in BGC-823 cells, which suggested that the regulatory effect of lncRNA-UCA1 on SATB1 by sponging miR-495-3p is cell-dependent. This study further identified that SATB1/miR-495-3p/lncRNA-UCA1 network is implicated in GC proliferation and invasion. The current study firstly revealed that SATB1 interacts with miR-495-3p/lncRNA-UCA1 network, whereby enhancing GC proliferation and invasion. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Accumulated evidence reveals that microRNAs play vital roles in various tumors, including gliomas. MiRNAs have been shown to participate in multiple cellular functions, including cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. Here, we investigate the potential role of a novel miRNA, miR-6807-3p, in glioma. A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot were applied to detect the expression of miR-6807-3p and its target molecule in glioma specimens and cultured cells. The direct targets of miR-6807-3p were predicted by bioinformatics software and were further verified by a luciferase reporter assay. The effects of miR-6807-3p on glioma cell proliferation, migration, cell apoptosis and the cell cycle of glioma cells were analyzed by the Cell-Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, a cell migration assay and flow cytometry assays. MiR-6807-3p was found to promote tumor growth and migration and inhibits apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro, thus playing a tumor oncogenic role in the progression of glioma. Expression levels of miR-6807-3p were greatly upregulated in glioma specimens, and dachshund homolog 1 (DACH1) was ascertained as a direct target of miR-6807-3p, modulated by the expression of miR-6807-3p in glioma cells. Aberrant expression of DACH1 was associated with the clinical survival of glioma patients. Furthermore, overexpression of DACH1 rescued the promotive effects of miR-6807-3p in glioma. Based on these findings, a novel miR-6807-3p may act as a glioma enhancer by targeting DACH1. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous disease with unique combinations of somatic molecular alterations in individual patients, as well as significant differences in populations across the world with regard to mutation spectra and mutation frequencies. Here we aim to describe mutational patterns and linked clinical parameters in a population-based NSCLC cohort. Materials and methods: Using targeted resequencing the mutational status of 82 genes was evaluated in a consecutive Swedish surgical NSCLC cohort, consisting of 352 patient samples from either fresh frozen or formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. The panel covers all exons of the 82 genes and utilizes reduced target fragment length and two-strand capture making it compatible with degraded FFPE samples. Results: We obtained a uniform sequencing coverage and mutation load across the fresh frozen and FFPE samples by adaption of sequencing depth and bioinformatic pipeline, thereby avoiding a technical bias between these two sample types. At large, the mutation frequencies resembled the frequencies seen in other western populations, except for a high frequency of KRAS hotspot mutations (43%) in adenocarcinoma patients. Worse overall survival was observed for adenocarcinoma patients with a mutation in either TP53, STK11 or SMARCA4. In the adenocarcinoma KRAS-mutated group poor survival appeared to be linked to concomitant TP53 or STK11 mutations, and not to KRAS mutation as a single aberration. Similar results were seen in the analysis of publicly available data from the cBioPortal. In squamous cell carcinoma a worse prognosis could be observed for patients with MLL2 mutations, while CSMD3 mutations were linked to a better prognosis. Conclusion: Here we have evaluated the mutational status of a NSCLC cohort. We could not confirm any survival impact of isolated driver mutations. Instead, concurrent mutations in TP53 and STK11 were shown to confer poor survival in the KRAS-positive adenocarcinoma subgroup. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Background: Etoposide-induced gene 24 (EI24) is an induction target of TP53-mediated apoptosis in human cancer cells. The hypothesis of this study is that EI24 might be a prognostic biomarker of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Material and methods: Fourteen gene expression NSCLC datasets with follow-up information (a total of 2582 accessible cases) were collected from Asia, Europe and North America. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses were applied to evaluate the relation between EI24 and the outcomes of NSCLC. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore EI24 and cancer-related gene signatures. Results: EI24 was significantly upregulated in mutated TP53 NSCLC samples and significantly downregulated with the increase in the TP53 expression level in NSCLC. GSEA results suggested that EI24 significantly enriched metastasis and poor prognosis gene signatures. Meanwhile, EI24 was significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal lungs (p < 0.01). It was also highly expressed in the later TNM stages and the ALK fusion+, higher MYC gene copy and EGFR wild type subgroups (p < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the expression of EI24 was significantly associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in a dose-dependent manner in GSE31210 dataset. The C-index of Cox model with EI24 is 0.70, that is better than that with MYC (0.51), KRAS (0.51) and EGFR (0.59), which indicates better prognostic performance of EI24. The prognostic significance of EI24 for overall survival of NSCLC was validated by pooled and meta-analysis on 14 datasets. The stratification analysis revealed that EI24 prognosticated poor overall survival (HR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.39–9.62, p < 0.05) in the TP53 wild type subgroup, but not in the mutated TP53 NSCLC subgroup. Moreover, YY1 might transcriptionally regulate EI24 in a positive manner. Conclusion: EI24 is a potential prognostic biomarker and impacts poor outcome in NSCLC. The prognostic significance of EI24 might rely on TP53 status. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has increased markedly. We examined how current ENDS users differ in perceptions of tobacco and ENDS-related health risks as a function of cigarette smoking status. Methods: We classified 1329 current ENDS users completing a national online survey based on cigarette smoking status, and employed linear and logistic regression to assess group differences in perceptions of tobacco-related health risks. Results: The sample consisted of 38% Current Cigarette Smokers, 40% Former Cigarette Smokers, and 22% Non-Smokers. Our targeted recruitment strategy yielded a balance of key descriptive variables across participants. Significant differences were observed in race, employment and marital status across cigarette smoking status, but not in gender, education, income, or sexual orientation. Participants reported considerable perceived knowledge about health risks associated with tobacco use, but less regarding ENDS use. Current Smokers rated ENDS use as riskier than Non-Smokers, and considered cigarette use less risky for both users and bystanders. Current Smokers were more likely to perceive cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer as the health risks associated with ENDS use. Former Smokers were more likely to perceive such risks with traditional tobacco use. Further, regardless of smoking status, perceived knowledge about the health risks of tobacco or ENDS use was positively associated with perceived likelihood of high risks of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Conclusions: Among current ENDS users, there were significant differences in perceived health risks based on cigarette smoking history. Improved health messaging can be achieved when cigarette smoking status is taken into account. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The spatial distribution, source identification and ecotoxicological impact of a group of persistent organic pollutants (POPs: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorobenzenes (PCBzs)), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated in surface sediment samples (0–5 cm, &lt;63 μm grain size) along the ecologically stressed Hooghly River estuary, East India. The results demonstrated a wide range of concentrations (ng/g dry weight) with the following decreasing order: ∑ 16 PAHs (3.3–630) &gt; ∑ 6 DDTs (0.14–18.6) &gt; ∑ 7 PCBs (0.28–7.7) &gt; ∑ 2 PCBzs (0.01–1.3) &gt; ∑ 5 HCH (0.10–0.6), with a dominance of p,p′-DDT and higher molecular weight PAHs. Selected diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of both pyrolytic and petrogenic sources of PAHs, inputs of weathered DDT and their degradation in oxidizing environment, and a predominance of industrial input over the agricultural wastes. The cumulative impact of the pollutants (effective range medium quotient (ERMq): 0.01–0.16) reflected minimal to low ecotoxicological risk, with highest probability of toxic effects towards surrounding biota at Barrackpore (21%). ∑ 6 DDTs exceeded the effect range low value resulting occasional adverse impact to the sediment dwelling organisms. Among the PAHs, the 4-ringed compounds accounted for 68% of the PAHs. Further, carcinogenic PAHs (BaA, Chry, BbF, BkF, BaP, DahP, Inp) possessed highest cancer risk (CR = 2.09 × 10 −3 ) to the local population when exposed to the sediments from the studied area and ingestion was found to be the primary process of contamination. The study strongly recommends a systematic monitoring of POPs and PAHs, being the Hooghly River water used by local people for their livelihood. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a significant risk of recurrence despite adjuvant intravesical therapy. Objective: To determine whether celecoxib, a cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitor, reduces the risk of recurrence in NMIBC patients receiving standard treatment. Design, setting, and participants: BOXIT (CRUK/07/004, ISRCTN84681538) is a double-blinded, phase III, randomised controlled trial. Patients aged ≥18 yr with intermediate- or high-risk NMIBC were accrued across 51 UK centres between 1 November 2007 and 23 July 2012. Intervention: Patients were randomised (1:1) to celecoxib 200 mg twice daily or placebo for 2 yr. Patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC were recommended to receive six weekly mitomycin C instillations; high-risk NMIBC cases received six weekly bacillus Calmette-Guérin and maintenance therapy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint was time to disease recurrence. Analysis was by intention to treat. Results and limitations: A total of 472 patients were randomised (236:236). With median follow-up of 44 mo (interquartile range: 36–57), 3-yr recurrence-free rate (95% confidence interval) was as follows: celecoxib 68% (61–74%) versus placebo 64% (57–70%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.82 [0.60–1.12], p = 0.2). There was no difference in high-risk (HR 0.77 [0.52–1.15], p = 0.2) or intermediate-risk (HR 0.90 [0.55–1.48], p = 0.7) NMIBC. Subgroup analysis suggested that time to recurrence was longer in pT1 NMIBC patients treated with celecoxib compared with those receiving placebo (HR 0.53 [0.30–0.94], interaction test p = 0.04). The 3-yr progression rates in high-risk patients were low: 10% (6.5–17%) and 9.7% (6.0–15%) in celecoxib and placebo arms, respectively. Incidence of serious cardiovascular events was higher in celecoxib (5.2%) than in placebo (1.7%) group (difference +3.4% [–0.3% to 7.2%], p = 0.07). Conclusions: BOXIT did not show that celecoxib reduces the risk of recurrence in intermediate- or high-risk NMIBC, although celecoxib was associated with delayed time to recurrence in pT1 NMIBC patients. The increased risk of cardiovascular events does not support the use of celecoxib. Patient summary: Celecoxib was not shown to reduce the risk of recurrence in intermediate- or high-risk non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), although celecoxib was associated with delayed time to recurrence in pT1 NMIBC patients. The increased risk of cardiovascular events does not support the use of celecoxib. Celecoxib did not reduce the overall risk of recurrence in intermediate- or high-risk non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Subgroup analysis reported that time to recurrence was significantly longer in pT1 patients treated with celecoxib, although cardiovascular events were higher. © 2018 European Association of Urology",

    "Funding Text 1": "BOXIT suggests that COX-2 inhibition did not reduce recurrence risk in intermediate- and high-risk NMIBC patients, although time to recurrence was significantly longer in pT1 patients. While CV risk precludes the use of celecoxib for secondary prevention, international consensus supports the use of aspirin due to its efficacy as well as safety profile [24] . Ongoing trials such as Add-Aspirin (NCT02804815), a prospective RCT investigating the role of aspirin in secondary prevention of breast, colorectal, stomach/oesophagus, and prostate cancer, will help inform the development of novel trials in NMIBC.

    "Abstract": "Fourteen compounds were isolated from the roots, leaves and twigs of Penianthus longifolius Miers (Menispermaceae), including two previously unreported neo-clerodane diterpenoids, penianthin (1), its C-8 epimer (2). In addition, the previously reported O-methylmoschatoline (3), taraxerol (4), taraxerone (5), rubrosterone, (6), panuosterone (7), 22-epi-20-hydroxyecdysone (8), ergosterol peroxide (9), stigmast-5-ene-3,7-dione (10), stigmasterol (11), β-sitosterol (12), stigmasterol glucoside (13) and β-sitosterol glucoside (14) were isolated. The structures of the compounds were determined by means of NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analysis. The absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by circular dichroism analysis. Compounds 1 and 2 were screened against the NCI60 cancer cell panel but showed no significant activity at 10 μM. © 2019 Phytochemical Society of Europe",

    "Abstract": "A 70-year-old man with a history of bladder and colon cancer presented with an enlarging mass in his right lower extremity. Forty years before presentation, he had injured his right lower extremity in a motor vehicle accident. Imaging findings indicated suspected sarcoma, which led to biopsy. Biopsy and further surgical exploration revealed the presence of a surgical sponge and surrounding local inflammatory reaction. No neoplasm was found, and the sponge and involved tissues were removed. Gossypiboma is exceedingly rare in the extremities. Imaging of retained foreign material can appear suggestive of sarcoma because of strong inflammatory responses and local tissue mass-like derangement resulting in heterogeneous signal changes. Ultimately, biopsy must be performed to ensure that no oncological pathological condition is present. © 2018, ISS.",

    "Abstract": "Benzimidazole is an interesting scaffold constituting a main core in many anticancer agents against variable cell lines as Carbendazim (I) and Nocodazole (II). Accordingly, eighteen compounds of 2-((1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)thio)-1-(aryl/heteroaryl)ethan-1-ones, in their sulfate salt and free forms, were designed and investigated as anticancer agents. In vitro preliminary screening of selected compounds by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) on a panel of 60 cell lines revealed renal cancer cell line (A498) as the most vulnerable cell line; accordingly, IC 50 values against A498 cell line were determined for compounds with the best results. The best inhibitory activity was for compound 4a with (IC 50 = 6.97 µM) compared to sunitinib as a reference drug (IC 50 = 6.99 µM). Compound 4a was further subjected to cell cycle analysis that indicated the decrease in cell population in the G2/M phase when compared to the untreated control cells. In addition, it showed significant increase in the late apoptosis in Annexin-V FTIC study compared to the control cells. An enzymatic inhibitory study on compound 4a against c-Met and MAP kinases revealed its better activity against c-Met kinase with (IC 50 = 0.27 µM) compared to sunitinib (IC 50 = 0.18 µM). Molecular docking study was conducted to reveal the interactions of compound 4a in the active site of c-Met kinase. Computational ADME study was performed to insure that compound 4a has proper pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Four new ent-kaurane diterpenoid maizediterpenes A-D (1–4), along with fourteen known compounds were isolated from the roots of Zea mays (maize). Compounds 7, 15, 16 were isolated from this genus for the first time. The planar structures of the new compounds were determined by extensive analysis of their NMR and HR-ESI-MS spectra, and the absolute configurations were established on the basis of specific rotation in association with calculated ECD spectra. Compounds 2, 6 and 18 showed significant antiproliferative effects against five human cancer cell lines (A549, MDA-MB-231, SK-Hep-1, SNU638, HCT116) with IC 50 values ranging from 1.99 ± 0.41 μM to 15.18 ± 1.17 μM. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant Wnt signaling has been implicated in a variety of disease. Inhibition of the Wnt pathway is an attractive approach for developing new therapeutics for the treatment of various types of fibrosis and cancers. We have discovered the phthalimide-phenylpyridine conjugate as a novel hit compound for the Wnt pathway inhibitors from cellular screening. The structure-activity relationship of these compounds suggested both of the substituent group on the phthalimide fragment and the structure of the linker were critical to the inhibitory activity. The most potent compound was about 10-folds more potent than the hit compound, with IC 50 value of 0.28 ± 0.01 µM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Six new anthracyclines (1-6) were obtained by the investigation of the solid fermented extract of a marine-derived Streptomyces sp. NB-A13. The structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, UV and IR. The absolute configurations of compounds 1-5 were established by calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) using time dependent density functional theory. Among the isolates, four compounds (2, 3, 5 and 6) showed moderate cytotoxic activity against PC3 cells (prostate cancer cells) with IC 50 values of 7.0 ± 0.3 μM, 0.92 ± 0.05 μM, 2.1 ± 0.7 μM and 9.8 ± 0.7 μM, respectively. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Impatiens balsamina is both an ornamental and pharmacologically important plant widely distributed in many Asian countries. The leaf of the plant contains many secondary metabolites possessing anti-microbial, anti-tumour and anti-cancer properties. Though there are many phytochemical studies done on the different natural extracts for this plant, not much of genetic information is currently available. This is the first transcriptome of I. balsamina leaf using paired-end Illumina HiSeq sequencing which generated 10.79 GB of raw data. Information of pre-processing (reads filtering), de novo assembly and functional annotation are presented. This data is accessible via NCBI BioProject (PRJNA505711). © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "The goal of the present study was to determine the efficacy of osimertinib (AZD9291), a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of aggressive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), compared to cisplatinum (CDDP) + pemetrexed (PEM). The NSCLC cell line PC-9 expressing green fluorescence protein (PC-9-GFP) was implanted in the brain of nude mice and was treated with CDDP + PEM or AZD9291. Tumors were observed by non-invasive fluorescence imaging. AZD9291 treatment caused tumor regression in contrast to CDDP + PEM which had only a slight inhibitory effect. These results suggest that AZD9291 is a promising clinical option for NSCLC patients with brain metastasis. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the type of cancer that most often kills after the initial diagnosis. To aid the specialist in its diagnosis, temporal evaluation is a potential tool for analyzing indeterminate lesions, which may be benign or malignant, during treatment. With this goal in mind, a methodology is herein proposed for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of changes in lung lesions. This methodology uses a modified version of the quality threshold clustering algorithm to associate each voxel of the lesion to a cluster, and changes in the lesion over time are defined in terms of voxel moves to another cluster. In addition, statistical features are extracted for classification of the lesion as benign or malignant. To develop the proposed methodology, two databases of pulmonary lesions were used, one for malignant lesions in treatment (public) and the other for indeterminate cases (private). We determined that the density change percentage varied from 6.22% to 36.93% of lesion volume in the public database of malignant lesions under treatment and from 19.98% to 38.81% in the private database of lung nodules. Additionally, other inter-cluster density change measures were obtained. These measures indicate the degree of change in the clusters and how each of them is abundant in relation to volume. From the statistical analysis of regions in which the density changes occurred, we were able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41%, demonstrating that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion. In addition to visualizing the density changes occurring in lesions over time, we quantified these changes and analyzed the entire set through volumetry, which is the technique most commonly used to analyze changes in pulmonary lesions. © 2018 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Our study aimed to investigate the association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Korean adults. Methods: A total of 365,457 participants aged ≥40 years were selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort from 2009 to 2015. HDL-C level was categorized into <1.0, 1.0–1.19, 1.2–1.39, 1.4–1.59, 1.6–1.79 (reference), 1.8–1.99, 2.0–2.19 and ≥ 2.20 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between HDL-C level and mortality risk. Results: In a median 3.5-year follow-up period, 9,350 participants (2.6%) died. Men with HDL-C level of 1.6–1.79 mmol/L and women with HDL-C level of 1.4–1.59 mmol/L had the lowest age-standardized mortality rates for all-cause death. However, for cardiovascular death, men with HDL-C level ≥2.20 mmol/L and women with HDL-C level of 1.8–1.99 mmol/L showed the lowest mortality rate. After adjusting for multiple covariates, the hazard ratios for all-cause and cancer deaths showed a U-shaped relationship with HDL-C level for both sexes. However, there were heterogenetic associations between HDL-C level and mortality risk of subtypes of cardiovascular disease by sex. For other causes of death except for cardiovascular and cancer death, elevated mortality risk was mainly due to external causes (ICD-10 code, S00-T98). Conclusions: In South Korea, very high HDL-C level was associated with increased risk of all-cause death. However, the increased all-cause mortality risk in people with very high HDL-C level was partly due to mortality risk from external causes. © 2019 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "CONTEXT: Recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) has been shown to be an effective stimulation method for radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy in differentiated thyroid cancer, including in those with nodal metastases (N1 DTC). OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the noninferiority of rhTSH vs thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) in preparation to RAI regarding disease status at the first evaluation in the real-life setting in patients with N1 DTC. DESIGN: This was a French multicenter retrospective study. Groups were matched according to age (<45/≥45 years), number of N1 nodes (≤5/>5 lymph nodes), and stage (pT1-T2/pT3). RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 404 patients pT1-T3/N1/M0 DTC treated with rhTSH (n = 205) or THW (n = 199). Pathological characteristics and initially administrated RAI activities (3.27 ± 1.00 GBq) were similar between the two groups. At first evaluation (6 to 18 months post-RAI), disease-free status was defined by thyroglobulin levels below threshold and a normal ultrasound. Disease-free rate was not inferior in the rhTSH group (75.1%) compared with the THW group (71.9%). The observed difference between the success rates was 3.3% (-6.6 to 13.0); rhTSH was therefore considered noninferior to THW because the upper limit of this interval was <15%. At the last evaluation (29.7 ± 20.7 months for rhTSH; 36.7 ± 23.8 months for THW), 83.5% (rhTSH) and 81.5% (THW) of patients achieved a complete response. This result was not influenced by any of the known prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: A preparation for initial RAI treatment with rhTSH was noninferior to that with THW in our series of pT1-T3/N1/M0-DTC on disease-free status outcomes at the first evaluation and after 3 years.

    "Abstract": "Objectives: MET amplification or MET exon 14 skipping site mutation can be treated with crizotinib in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Y1003 is a binding site for E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is critical for MET degradation. Here we show an adenocarcinoma patient with Y1003S mutation and she got tumor remission after crizotinib treatment. Materials and methods: A 61-year-old never-smoking female was admitted to our hospital due to increased carcino-embryonicantigen. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed enlargement of bilateral cervical, left supraclavicular and multiple mediastinal lymph nodes. PET-CT also showed stripe in the left upper lobe. Adenocarcinoma cells were found from biopsy on her left supraclavicular lymph nodes. We detected cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from peripheral blood and identified a MET Y1003S mutation by next generation sequencing technology. Y1003 mutations predicted to be similar to MET exon 14 skipping in functionality based on the literature. After an extensive discussion of treatment options, the patient opted to treatment with crizotinib, a small-molecule dual inhibitor of the MET and ALK. Results and conclusion: Dramatic response was observed within 1 months of treatment, which lasted more than 10 months. Chest CT scans revealed significant improvement of the lung focus and decrease in size of the lymph nodes lesions, meeting RECIST partial response criteria (−30%). Y1003 alterations may be diverse mutations and sensitive to MET inhibitors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive cervical lymph node (CLN) metastasis of unknown primary origin is classified as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) T0 by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual (8th edition). We aimed to investigate the possible primary sites and patterns of EBV-positive CLN metastases and to provide implications for the management of NPC T0 classification. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 269 patients with newly diagnosed EBV-positive CLN metastatic disease who underwent EBV detection via EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization. Fifteen patients with unknown primary tumors underwent follow-up after initial treatment. Results: In patients with EBV-positive CLNs, the most common primary sites after the nasopharynx (51.7%) were the salivary gland (24.5%), lung (7.8%), oropharynx (3.3%), nasal cavity/maxillary (3.3%), oral cavity (2.2%), orbit (1.1%), and liver (0.4%). No primary site was found in 15 patients (5.6%). For salivary gland malignancies, level II and I were the most frequently involved regions. Tumors arising from the lung or liver metastasized to the lower neck (level IV, V, and VI) rather than the upper neck. After initial treatment, 2/15 patients with EBV-positive CLNs of unknown primary exhibited primary NPC and oropharyngeal tumor, respectively. Further, even without prophylactic irradiation to the nasopharynx, only one of 13 unknown primary patients developed NPC. Conclusions: The origins of EBV-positive CLNs may not be restricted to the nasopharynx alone, and are likely to involve the head and neck or non-head and neck regions. NPC T0 classification should be cautiously assigned to such tumors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and investigations on novel targets are imperative. MiR-98 has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor in several cancers. To evaluate miR-98 as a novel anticancer molecule for CRC, examinations to validate whether miR-98 conferred an inhibiting effect on proliferation, migration, and invasion were performed. The microarray-based gene expression profiling involving CRC was used to identify the differentially expressed genes. The potential relationship between miR-98 and CLDN1 was analyzed by cell experimentation. Then, the CRC cells were transfected with miR-98 mimic or miR-98 inhibitor to investigate the potential effect of miR-98 overexpression and depletion on CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. The expressions of CLDN1, Bcl-2 associated protein x (Bax), runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), C-myc, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were determined. The downregulated miR-98 along with an upregulated CLDN1 was observed in CRC, in which miR-98 could target to regulate CLDN1. The overexpression of miR-98 or silencing of CLDN1 was shown to increase the expression of Bax and RUNX3 along with promoted cell apoptosis and arrested cells in G1 phase, while decreasing the expression of CLDN1, Bcl-2, C-myc, and PCNA with suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion. Collectively, the current study supports the notion that miR-98 plays an inhibitory role in human CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and act as a contributor for cell apoptosis by downregulating CLDN1. The current study highlights a potential future strategy to help prevent the development of CRC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "A multi-stimuli responsive nanoagent, hydroxy boron nitride nanosheets and Pd nanohybrids (Pd@OH-BNNS), was studied. The well-dispersed hydroxy boron nitride nanosheets were prepared via a facile thermal substitution approach. Pd@OH-BNNS was endowed with a photothermal property after in situ formation of Pd nanoparticles on the surface of the nanosheets. Pd@OH-BNNS as a drug delivery carrier exhibited high loading capability for the anticancer drug doxorubicin. The release of doxorubicin from the nanohybrids was triggered by a decrease in pH, and increases in glutathione concentration and near-infrared irradiation. The faster release behavior of the nanohybrids under near-infrared irradiation was confirmed by a cellular uptake study. In addition, local hyperthermia was verified using an imaging test and an infrared thermal camera. Tumor growth was remarkably inhibited in mice after two weeks of treatment with Pd@OH-BNNS/doxorubicin injection, demonstrating the high efficacy of combining chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. The Pd@OH-BNNS as a drug delivery system exhibited good stability, low cytotoxicity and multi-stimuli responsiveness. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Pooled analyses have suggested a small increased risk of childhood leukemia associated with distance and with exposure to high magnetic fields from power transmission lines. Because magnetic fields are correlated with distance from lines, the question of whether the risk is due to magnetic fields exposure or to some other factor associated with distance from lines is unresolved. We used data from a large records-based case-control study to examine several research questions formulated to disentangle the relationships among magnetic fields, distance from high voltage lines, and childhood leukemia risk. In models examining an interaction between distance and magnetic fields exposure, we found that neither close proximity to high voltage lines alone nor exposure to high calculated fields alone were associated with childhood leukemia risk. Rather, elevated risk was confined to the group that was both very close to high voltage lines (<50 m) and had high calculated fields (≥0.4 μT) (odds ratio 4.06, 95% CI 1.16, 14.3). Further, high calculated fields (≥0.4 μT) that were due solely to lower voltage lines (<200 kV) were not associated with elevated risk; rather, risk was confined to high fields attributable to high voltage lines. Whilst other explanations are possible, our findings argue against magnetic fields as a sole explanation for the association between distance and childhood leukemia and in favor of some other explanation linked to characteristics of power lines. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: Various molecular mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the leading fatal diseases. Although human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is critical in promoting CRC development, its regulatory mechanism is still elusive. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) is important to CRC pathogenesis, but the upstream regulation of CCL2 requires further investigation. Therefore, we aim to investigate the crosstalk mechanism between hTERT and CCL2 and its involvement in the pathogenesis of CRC. Methods: The expression relationship between hTERT and CCL2 was verified in CRC and adjacent tissues by immunohistochemistry. Lentiviruses or plasmids were used to regulate hTERT and CCL2 expression. The roles of hTERT and CCL2 in cell growth and migration were studied using CCK8 and transwell assays. The interaction between hTERT and CCL2 was detected by a luciferase reporter assay, immunofluorescence and ChIP assays. The β-catenin/TCF-4 complex was confirmed by COIP. Results: Both hTERT and CCL2 expression levels were markedly increased in CRC tissues compared to the adjacent stroma. Moreover, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were found in tumor areas with higher expression levels of hTERT and CCL2. hTERT promoted HCT116 cell migration and invasion by increasing CCL2 expression. Mechanistically, ectopic hTERT facilitated the nuclear translocation of canonical β-catenin and the formation of a complex with downstream effector TCF-4, which eventually activated the CCL2 promoter. Conclusions: hTERT may promote CRC by recruiting β-catenin/TCF-4 complex to transactivate CCL2 expression, which is a novel crosstalk mechanism likely involved in the pathogenesis of CRC. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as the third leading cancer-caused deaths, prevails with high mortality, and affects more than half a million individuals per year worldwide. A former study revealed that microRNA-221 (miR-221) was involved in cell proliferation of liver cancer and HCC development. The current study aims to evaluate whether miR-221 targeting SOCS3 affects HCC through JAK–STAT3 signaling pathway. A series of miR-221 mimic, miR-221 inhibitor, siRNA against SOCS3, and SOCS3 plasmids were introduced to SMMC7721 cells with the highest miR-221 expression assessed. The expression of JAK–STAT3 signaling pathway–related genes and proteins was determined by Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis, viability, migration, and invasion were evaluated by means of flow cytometry, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, and transwell assays, respectively. HCC xenograft in nude mice was performed to measure HCC tumor growth. miR-221 was found to be highly expressed but SOCS3 was poorly expressed in HCC tissues. miR-221 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and tumor node metastasis (TNM) of HCC, and SOCS3 expression was correlated with LNM, differentiation and TNM of HCC. SOCS3 is a target gene of miR-221. MiR-221 mimic or si-SOCS3 exposure was found to induce cell viability, migration, and invasion, and reduce apoptosis. MiR-221 inhibitor was observed to have inhibitory effects on HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, the expression of JAK–STAT3 signaling pathway was suppressed by miR-221 inhibitor. Downregulated miR-221 expression could promote its target gene SOCS3 to inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells by repressing JAK–STAT3 signaling pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) can be quantified by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and can predict tissue microstructure. The aim of the present study was to analyze possible associations between ADC histogram based parameters with different histopathological parameters in cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and methods: 18 female patients (age range 32–79 years) with squamous cell cervical carcinoma were retrospectively enrolled. In all cases, pelvic MRI was performed with a DWI (b-values 0 and 1000 s/mm2). Histogram analysis was performed as a whole lesion measurement. Histopathological parameters included expression of EGFR, VEGF, Hif1-alpha, Her2 and Histone 3. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to analyze associations between investigated parameters. Results: Analyze of the investigated ADC histogram parameters showed a good interreader variability, ranging from 0.705 for entropy to 0.959 for ADCmedian. EGFR expression correlated statistically significant with several histogram parameters. The highest correlation was observed for p75 (p = −0.562, P = 0.015). There were several correlations with histone 3, the highest with p25 (p = −0.610, P = 0.007). None of the ADC related parameters correlated statistically significant with expression of VEGF, Hif1-alpha and Her2. Conclusion: Histogram analysis showed a good interreader agreement. ADC histogram parameters might be able to reflect expression of EGFR and histone 3 in cervical squamous cell carcinomas, but not expression of VEGF, Hif1-alpha and Her2. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Insulin growth factor (IGF) family and their receptors play a great role in tumors’ development. In addition, IGF-1 enhances cancer progression through regulating cell proliferation, angiogenesis, immune modulation and metastasis. Moreover, nicotinamide is association with protection against cancer. Therefore, we conducted this research to examine the therapeutic effects of nicotinamide against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) both in vivo and in vitro through affecting IGF-1 and the balance between PKB and Nrf2. HCC was induced in rats by 200 mg/kg, ip thioacetamide. The rat survival, number and size of tumors and serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) were measured. The gene and protein levels of IGF-1, Nrf2, PKB and JNK-MAPK were assessed in rat livers. In addition, HepG2 cells, human HCC cell lines, were treated with different concentrations of nicotinamide. We found that nicotinamide enhanced the rats’ survival and reduced the number and size of hepatic tumors as well as it reduced serum AFP and HepG2 cells survival. Nicotinamide ameliorated HCC-induced reduction in the expression of Nrf2. Moreover, nicotinamide blocked HCC-induced elevation in IGF-1, PKB and JNK-MAPK. In conclusion, nicotinamide produced cytotoxic effects against HCC both in vivo and in vitro. The cytotoxic activity can be explained by inhibition of HCC-induced increased in the expression of IGF-1 and leads to disturbances in the balance between the cell death signal by PKB and MAPK; and the cell survival signal by Nrf2, directing it towards cell survival signals in normal liver cells providing more protection for body against tumor. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Cardiac catheterizations (CC) represent a set of interventional procedure used in the diagnosis and treatment of coronary arteries diseases. Whereas interventional procedures perhaps represent only some 12% of all radiological procedures they nevertheless contribute about 48% of the total collective dose worldwide. In a Sudanese based study, the objectives of present work have been to evaluate patient radiation dose and to estimate effective doses and cancer risks for three types of cardiac catheterization procedure. Radiation doses and the associated radiation risks have been evaluated for a total of 346 patients undergoing treatments for a range of clinical indications, including 187 Diagnostic Coronary Angiographic (DCA) procedures (54%), 118 Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) (34.1%) and 41 Pacemaker (PM) procedures (11.9%)). The respective effective dose ranges were 4.0- to 59.3 mSv, 11.4- to 175 mSv and 7.2- to 51.5 mSv. None of the present patient cohort developed tissue reactions, deterministic effects clearly being anathema in diagnostic radiological practice. With optimization of patient doses being fundamental to best practice, and with it an associated mitigation of stochastic risk, not least in regard to patients of younger age facing the greatest risk, there is particular concern regarding training and experience of radiographic staff, as results show. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Sixteen BRAF-mutation positive, metastatic melanoma patients with highly advanced disease received combination therapy of vemurafenib and ipilimumab as an individual treatment decision. Our aim was to assess the role of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the evaluation of the clinical benefit (CB) of this combination treatment. After clinical improvement under vemurafenib monotherapy, four cycles of ipilimumab were additionally administered. F-FDG PET/CT was performed before the start, after two cycles and after completion of the combined ipilimumab/vemurafenib treatment. PET-based patient response evaluation to treatment was based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the PET Response Evaluation Criteria for Immunotherapy criteria. Progression-free survival (PFS) from the end of combination treatment was calculated. According to their best clinical response at the end of combination treatment, eight patients showed CB and eight patients had no-CB. Two patients revealed extraordinary good clinical outcome with PFS of more than 5 years. Overall, 13 out of 16 patients were correctly classified by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and 15 out of 16 by the PET Response Evaluation Criteria for Immunotherapy criteria. Median PFS was 8.8 months among PET-responders and 3.6 months among nonresponders. During immunotherapy administration seven patients developed radiologic signs of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), with colitis and arthritis being the most frequent ones; these patients had a significantly longer PFS than those without irAEs (P=0.036). F-FDG PET/CT is a valuable tool for the evaluation of patients receiving a combination of targeted treatment and immunotherapy. The appearance of irAEs on PET/CT might correlate with benefit to immunotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "RRx-001 is a pleiotropic anticancer agent in phase III clinical trials, which polarizes tumor-associated macrophages from a low phagocytic M2 phenotype to a high phagocytic M1 phenotype. One of the ways in which tumors promote M2 polarization and evade macrophage-mediated destruction is through upregulation of CD47 expression. As a myeloid-specific immune checkpoint, CD47 interacts with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on macrophages and monocytes to prevent phagocytosis. Herein, the effect of RRx-001 on CD47 and SIRPα expression was evaluated as well as its activity in vivo in macrophage-depleted tumors. In vitro, RRx-001 was found to decrease the expression levels of CD47 and SIRPα on tumor cells and monocytes/macrophages, respectively, reducing the phagocytosis inhibitory function of the CD47/SIRPα interaction. In vivo, macrophage depletion by clodronate in an A549 xenograft-bearing mouse model attenuated the ability of RRx-001 to suppress tumor growth, which suggests that the presence of infiltrated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment is a sine qua non condition for the antitumor activity of RRx-001. Furthermore, these in vitro effects translate into significant antitumor activity in mouse models of lung cancer. Importantly, unlike anti-CD47 antibodies, RRx-001, which has been evaluated in close to 300 patients in 9 clinical trials, is not associated with any hematologic toxicities. On the basis of demonstrated antitumor activity and minimal toxicity in phase II clinical trials, RRx-001 has received clearance from the FDA and the EMA for phase III, multicenter studies in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "The histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) is implicated in the development of cancers, targeting LSD1 has been recognized as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. To date, some small-molecule inhibitors are currently being investigated in clinical trials. Herein we report the design, synthesis and biochemical characterization of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives as new LSD1 inhibitors. Of these compounds, compound C26 inhibited LSD1 in a reversible manner (IC 50 = 1.72 μM) and showed selectivity to LSD1 over MAO-A/B. Besides, compound C26 displayed FAD-competitive binding to LSD1. Interestingly, C26 did not inhibit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and quench H 2 O 2 , thus excluding the possibility that LSD1 inhibition by C26 was due to the HRP inhibition and consumption of H 2 O 2 . In LSD1 overexpressed A549 cells, compound C26 concentration-dependently induced accumulation of H3K4me1/me2 and H3K9me2 and showed cellular target engagement to LSD1. Additionally, compound C26 significantly inhibited migration of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, further western blot analysis showed that C26 increased expression levels of epithelial cell markers E-Cadherin and Claudin-1, down-regulated mesenchymal cell marker N-Cadherin and the upstream transcription factors Snail and Slug. Docking studies were also performed to rationalize the potency of C26 toward LSD1. To conclude, the [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine could serve as a promising scaffold for the development of new LSD1 inhibitors. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of aflatoxins due to arepa, bread and rice consumption among the adult population of the Department of Caldas, Colombia. A high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) was validated and used to determine aflatoxins in 246 samples. Dietary exposure was calculated by estimated daily intake (EDI), whereas risk characterization was assessed using the risk of cancer and margin of exposure (MOE) approaches. The method showed good selectivity, linearity (R2 &gt; 0.9993), limit of detection (LOD = 0.004–0.014 ng mL−1), limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.014–0.046 ng mL−1), accuracy (2.40%–14.1%), and recovery (58%–110%). Aflatoxins were detected in 38.6% of the samples at levels between 0.08 and 41.75 μg kg−1, and 11.4% of the samples contaminated with AFB1 exceeded the limit (2 μg kg−1) established by the European Commission (EC). The EDI of aflatoxins due to the consumption of arepa (0.732) and rice (3.093) were above the recommended level of 0.017 ng kg−1 bw day−1. Also, the estimated number of liver cancer cases associated with AFB1 exposure due to arepa (0.726) and rice (3.314) consumption was above the suggested limit of 0.1 cases/75 years/100,000 individuals. Finally, the MOEs obtained by arepa and rice consumption were 277.5 and 60.79, respectively, far from the safe margin of 10,000, thereby indicating a potential risk to public health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Early detection is prerequisite for a successful cancer treatment. Recent advances in nanoscience and imaging technology allow the application of nanomaterials for early cancer diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become one of the most extensively used and powerful tool for noninvasive clinical diagnosis. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of iron oxide nanoparticles coated with natural rubber latex (NRL), as well as their incorporation in a gelatin matrix to be used as an MRI contrast agent. Nanoparticles physical properties were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electronic microscope (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), magnetometry and MRI. XRD profiles indicated that magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) with spinel structure were formed. TEM images showed the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles with average size about 9–14 nm, depending on the NRL concentration. Magnetization curves demonstrated iron oxide nanoparticles having superparamagnetic characteristics with increased magnetization as a function of NRL concentration. The zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) curves show decreased blocking temperature upon coating magnetic nanoparticles with NRL. MRI results showed proton nuclear relaxivity ratios (r2/r1) of prepared MNPs significantly decreased by increasing the amount of NRL in the synthesis. Therefore, it can be concluded that NRL coated MNPs can be considered as an effective contrast agent for MRI applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Saikosaponin-d (SSD) is a triterpene saponin isolated from Bupleurum plants. It has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. However, its biomedical applications are limited by its poor water solubility. Cyclodextrins are highly water soluble oligosaccharide compounds which can form inclusion complexes with lipophilic drugs. Purpose: We complexed SSD with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) in various ratios to form SSD-HPBCD inclusion complexes. The inclusion complexes were evaluated for their solubility, physicochemical properties and cytotoxic effects in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells. Methods: Surface morphology of pure SSD and SSD-HPBCD inclusion complexes was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Crystalline structure was determined by X-ray diffractometry. Intermolecular hydrogen bond formation between SSD and HPBCD was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma HSC-1 cell viability was determined by the MTS assay, and cell apoptosis by the caspase 3/7 assay. Signal transduction pathways were investigated by Western blotting. Results: SSD-HPBCD inclusion complexes showed greatly increased water solubility. This was associated with an improvement in physicochemical properties, including transformation of crystalline structure to amorphous form, and formation of hydrogen bonds between SSD and HPBCD. In addition, SSD-HPBCD inclusion complexes induced apoptosis in HSC-1 cells, and this was mediated through activation of MAPK and suppression of Akt-mTOR signaling pathways. Conclusion: SSD-HPBCD inclusion complex shows improvement in water solubility and physicochemical properties, and exhibits anticancer effects against cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells. Therefore, it may be a potential drug formulation for the treatment of skin cancer. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Overexpression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 has been observed in various cancers, which indicates that H19 exert important roles in the progression of carcinogenesis. MiR-326 has been reported to play tumor suppressive roles in multiple tumors. Recently, the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis has implied that lncRNAs might function as molecular sponges for microRNAs in various cancers. However, the roles of H19/miR-326 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still remain unclear. The aim of our study was to determine H19/miR-326 expression in HCC cells and investigate their roles in HCC development. We found that H19 was significantly elevated and miR-326 was decreased in HCC cells including Hep3B, HepG2, MHCC-97L, SK-hep1, Hun7, SMCC-7721 compared with LO2 cells, respectively. In the subsequent experiments, we observed that inhibition of H19 can repress HCC cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro. H19 downregulation can increase miR-326 expression in HCC cells. Meanwhile, miR-326 mimics can also inhibit HCC progression, whereas miR-326 inhibitors exhibited a reverse phenomenon by modulating H19 expression. In addition, a negative association between H19 and miR-326 was predicted and confirmed. Furthermore, the transcription factor TWIST1 has been recognized as a significant regulator in tumor progression. Here, by performing bioinformatics analysis, TWIST1 was identified as a downstream target of miR-326. The findings of our study implied that lncRNA H19 can serve as a ceRNA to sponge miR-326 and modulate TWIST1 levels in HCC pathogenesis. Taken these together, these findings indicated that H19/miR-326/TWIST1 axis was involved in HCC development and can indicate a novel HCC target. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The melanoma is responsible for the majority of all skin cancer–related deaths worldwide. Evidence suggests that local anesthetics provide some benefit in the treatment of cancer via inhibition of cellular proliferation, invasion and migration. However, the potential antiproliferative effects of local anesthetics in the treatment of melanoma remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative effects and underlying mechanism of the commonly used local anesthetic (lidocaine) on melanoma cells. A375 melanoma cells were treated by lidocaine or vemurafenib. Cell Counting Kit-8, histological staining, flow cytometric analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blot analyses were carried out to test the effects of lidocaine and vemurafenib on A375 cells. BALB/C-nu/nu mice intraperitoneally injected with A375 cells were treated by lidocaine, and then tumor volume and weight were calculated. Lidocaine exhibited vemurafenib-like effects totally. Lidocaine inhibited A375 melanoma cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner and colony formation also showed a dose-dependent inhibition. Lidocaine treatment resulted in the arrest of cell-cycle progression in the G1 phase and inhibited Ki-67 expression in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was associated with inhibited extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. In vivo experiments revealed that intravenous injections of lidocaine suppressed tumor volume and weight. Lidocaine inhibits melanoma cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner via a mechanism that may involve inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway. Thus, lidocaine may provide some benefit for the treatment of melanoma. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Triptolide (TPL) is the active component of Tripterygium wifordii Hook F, which has been reported to exert anti-tumor efficacies. Herein, we aimed to examine the efficacy of TPL in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and to reveal its underlying mechanisms. Methods: Human CRC cell lines HT-29 and SW480 were treated by TPL for 24 h in the presence or absence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer TGF-β1. The expression of miR-191 in cell was overexpressed by miRNA transfection. Thereafter, cell viability, migration, apoptosis, EMT-related protein expressions, and the activation of NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin pathways were respectively assessed. Moreover, a mouse model of CRC was established and the effects of TPL on the growth of primary tumors were tested. Results: TPL (50 and 100 nM) significantly reduced cell viability and migration, but increased apoptotic cell rate. TPL up-regulated Bax, increased the cleavage of caspase-3 and -9, and neutralized TGF-β1-induced alterations of EMT indicators, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail. At the meantime, TPL treatment down-regulated miR-191 expression, and the effect of TPL on miR-191 expression was mediated by EZH2. More interestingly, anti-CRC properties and the inhibitory effects of TPL on NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin pathways were reversed by miR-191 up-regulation. In vivo data showed that, TPL treatment decreased the growth of primary tumor xenografts and the expression of miR-191. Conclusion: TPL is effective in killing CRC cells and suppressing the migratory capacity. TPL exerts anti-CRC properties possibly via down-regulating miR-191, and blocking the activation of NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) catalyze the covalent addition of sugars to a broad range of lipophilic molecules. This biotransformation plays a critical role in elimination of a broad range of exogenous chemicals and by-products of endogenous metabolism, and also controls the levels and distribution of many endogenous signaling molecules. In mammals, the superfamily comprises four families: UGT1, UGT2, UGT3, and UGT8. UGT1 and UGT2 enzymes have important roles in pharmacology and toxicology including contributing to interindividual differences in drug disposition as well as to cancer risk. These UGTs are highly expressed in organs of detoxification (e.g., liver, kidney, intestine) and can be induced by pathways that sense demand for detoxification and for modulation of endobiotic signaling molecules. The functions of the UGT3 and UGT8 family enzymes have only been characterized relatively recently; these enzymes show different UDP-sugar preferences to that of UGT1 and UGT2 enzymes, and to date, their contributions to drug metabolism appear to be relatively minor. This review summarizes and provides critical analysis of the current state of research into all four families of UGT enzymes. Key areas discussed include the roles of UGTs in drug metabolism, cancer risk, and regulation of signaling, as well as the transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of UGT expression and function. The latter part of this review provides an in-depth analysis of the known and predicted functions of UGT3 and UGT8 enzymes, focused on their likely roles in modulation of levels of endogenous signaling pathways.",

    "Abstract": "Growth of cancer cells within the human body is a major outcome of the manipulation of cells and it has resulted in the deterioration of the life span of humans. The impact of cancer cells is irretrievable and it has paved the way to the formation of tumors within the human body. For achieving and developing a single-structured framework to prominently identify the tumor regions and segmenting the tissue structures specifically in human brain, a novel combinational algorithm is proposed through this paper. The algorithm has been embodied with two optimization techniques namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and bacteria foraging optimization (BFO), wherein, PSO helps in finding the best position of global bacterium for BFO, consecutively, BFO supports the modified fuzzy c means (MFCM) algorithm by providing optimized cluster heads. Finally, MFCM segments the tissue regions and identifies the tumor portion, thereby reducing the interaction and complication experienced by a radiologist during patient diagnosis. The strength of the proposed algorithm is proven by comparing it with the state-of-the-art techniques by means of evaluation parameters like mean squared error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), sensitivity, specificity, etc., Data sets used in this paper were exclusively obtained from hospital, Brain web simulator and BRATS-2013 challenge. The sensitivity and specificity values for 115 MR brain slice images are 0.9545 and 0.9905, which prove the segmentation ability and multitude characteristics possessed by the proposed PSBFO based MFCM (PSBFO-MFCM) algorithm. © 2018 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To optimise cross-sectional chest imaging usage by identifying frequency and risk factors associated with thoracic metastases in cervical cancer patients after initial definitive treatment. Materials and methods: This study, conducted during 2004–2015, examined 361 consecutive patients with histopathologically proven cervical carcinoma with at least 1 year of follow-up. Electronic medical records and all available imaging modes were used to record and assess patient and tumour characteristics and timing of thoracic metastases. Associations with these characteristics and thoracic metastases were assessed using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelling. Results: Of the 361 patients, 31 developed thoracic metastases. Multivariate regression results showed that adeno/adenosquamous carcinomas (hazard ratio [HR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 5.72), other histology (HR, 5.61; 95% CI, 1.81 to 17.42), high International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.09 to 7.37), and presence of initial intra-abdominal lymph node metastases (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.90) were associated significantly and independently with thoracic metastases. The second analysis among the subgroup of surgical treatment identified intermediate–high risk classification of recurrence (HR, 5.12; 95% CI, 1.14 to 22.94), high FIGO stage (HR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.05 to 7.13), and other histology (HR, 11.51; 95% CI, 3.66 to 36.19) as independent predictors of thoracic metastases. Two of the 361 and 2/313 patients with thoracic metastases who did not correspond to the conditions above were in the respective evaluation groups. Conclusion: Assessment of negative prognostic factors for thoracic metastases might contribute to reduced need for chest cross-sectional chest computed tomography examinations. © 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists",

    "Abstract": "This work reports a new approach of synthesis of FePt nanoparticles in aqueous medium using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant as a capping agent and the influence of change of its concentration on the size of the particles. Tuning of magnetic properties has also been done by changing the CTAB concentrations. Here at higher CTAB concentration, particles formed are of smaller size compared to the size prepared in lower micellar concentration. The ordering parameter of the particles after annealing at 550 °C with the variation of particle size is also studied. The magnetic properties of these particles are studied and the effect of particle phase and size on magnetic property is also investigated. The particles are prepared in aqueous medium because water soluble particles are useful for hyperthermia therapy. Heating abilities of the particles under AC magnetic field are also checked with change in their size. The studies on interaction of particles with cancer cell line was also performed with probing the cell by fluorescence imaging technique after bio-functionalization of the particles by sodium oleate and fluorescent dye rhodamine-B-isothiocyanate (RITC). All these preliminary studies indicate a promising applicability of the particles for localized cancer treatment by magnetic field induced hyperthermia therapy. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To develop and translate a metabolite-specific imaging sequence using a symmetric echo planar readout for clinical hyperpolarized (HP) Carbon-13 ( 13 C) applications. Methods: Initial data were acquired from patients with prostate cancer (N = 3) and high-grade brain tumors (N = 3) on a 3T scanner. Samples of [1- 13 C]pyruvate were polarized for at least 2 h using a 5T SPINlab system operating at 0.8 K. Following injection of the HP substrate, pyruvate, lactate, and bicarbonate (for brain studies) were sequentially excited with a singleband spectral-spatial RF pulse and signal was rapidly encoded with a single-shot echo planar readout on a slice-by-slice basis. Data were acquired dynamically with a temporal resolution of 2 s for prostate studies and 3 s for brain studies. Results: High pyruvate signal was seen throughout the prostate and brain, with conversion to lactate being shown across studies, whereas bicarbonate production was also detected in the brain. No Nyquist ghost artifacts or obvious geometric distortion from the echo planar readout were observed. The average error in center frequency was 1.2 ± 17.0 and 4.5 ± 1.4 Hz for prostate and brain studies, respectively, below the threshold for spatial shift because of bulk off-resonance. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of symmetric EPI to acquire HP 13 C metabolite maps in a clinical setting. As an advance over prior single-slice dynamic or single time point volumetric spectroscopic imaging approaches, this metabolite-specific EPI acquisition provided robust whole-organ coverage for brain and prostate studies while retaining high SNR, spatial resolution, and dynamic temporal resolution. © 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",

    "Abstract": "ZnO nanoparticles have been synthesized using solution combustion technique and its antioxidant, antifungal, anticancer activity was studied. Ricinus communis plant seed extract used as fuel in synthesis by the solution combustion technique. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) demonstrates the arrangement of a crystalline hexagonal stage (ICDD card number 89–1397) with space aggregate P63mc (186) and cell parameters a = b = 3.253, c = 5.213 Å. The normal crystallite measure is 20 nm which is ascertained by Debye - Scherer's formula. The Purity of the sample and metal to oxygen bond development was affirmed by utilizing Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and the particle size and shape was confirmed by HRTEM. Antifungal action of ZnO NPs was studied against Aspergillus and Penicillium by well dispersion strategy. The antifungal activity shows that ZnO NPs constitute as an effective fungicidal agent against both Aspergillus (4 ± 0.5 mm) and Penicillium (3 mm ± 0.4 mm) at 30 μg/mL fixation. ZnO nanoparticles were subjected to antioxidant activity. The objective of the study was to analyze the anticancer property of ZnO NPs on MDA-MB 231 cancer cells. To check the efficacy of the synthesized drug ZnO NPs MTT assay was performed, that determines % viability and/or cytotoxicity. IC50 of ZnO NPs in case of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer was 7.103 μg/mL. Anticancer outcome demonstrates that ZnO NPs is active against in MDA-MB-231 cells. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: The EMBRACE II study combines state-of-the-art Image-Guided Adaptive Brachytherapy in cervix cancer with an advanced protocol for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) which specifies target volume selection, contouring and treatment planning. In EMBRACE II, well-defined EBRT is an integral part of the overall treatment strategy with the primary aim of improving nodal control and reducing morbidity. The EMBRACE II EBRT planning concept is based on improved conformality through relaxed coverage criteria for all target volumes. For boosting of lymph nodes, a simultaneous integrated boost and coverage probability planning is applied. Before entering EMBRACE II, institutes had to go through accreditation. Material and methods: As part of accreditation, a treatment planning dummy-run included educational blocks and submission of an examination case provided by the study coordinators. Seventy-one centers submitted 123 EBRT dose distributions. Replanning was required if hard constraints were violated or planning concepts were not fully accomplished. Dosimetric parameters of original and revised plans were compared. Results: Only 11 plans violated hard constraints. Twenty-seven centers passed after first submission. 27 needed one and 13 centers needed more revisions. The most common reasons for revisions were low conformality, relatively high OAR doses or insufficient lymph node coverage reduction. Individual feedback on planning concepts improved plan quality considerably, resulting in a median body V43Gy reduction of 158 cm 3 from first plan submission to approved plan. Conclusion: A dummy-run as applied in EMBRACE II, consisting of training and examination cases enabled us to test institutes’ treatment planning capabilities, and improve plan quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: To develop a natural language processing (NLP)-based algorithm for extracting clinically useful information for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs) and use these data for the assessment of HCC staging. Materials and Methods: Clinical documents, including operation notes, radiology and pathology reports, of 92 HCC patients were collected from Chinese EMRs. We randomly grouped these patients into training (n = 60) and testing (n = 32) datasets. Rule-based and hybrid methods for extracting information were developed using the training set of manually-annotated operation notes. The method with better performance was used to process other documents. The performance of the algorithm was assessed via calculating the precision, recall and F-score for exact-boundary and partial-boundary matching strategies. The utility of clinically useful information for the HCC staging was assessed in comparison with that manually reviewed. Results: For operation notes, the rule-based and hybrid methods had a precision, recall and F-score ≥80% when the exact-boundary and partial-boundary matching strategies were applied to the testing dataset. By using the rule-based method (which has better performance than the hybrid method), three other types of documents also obtained good performance. When the extracted clinically useful information was applied for the HCC staging, the concordance rate with the manual review was 75%. Conclusion: A NLP system was developed for clinical information extraction and HCC staging based on EMRs, and the results indicate that Chinese NLP has potential utility in clinical research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To assess whether there is a significant difference in perfusion parameters between benign and malignant prostatic lesions, focusing on semi-quantitative analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Material and methods: Three hundred and thirteen patients who underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate and with available corresponding histology (prostatectomy or biopsy) were selected retrospectively for this study. The MRI protocol consisted of multiplanar T2-and diffusion-weighted imaging, DCE and delayed axial T1 images. Images were reviewed independently by two radiologists for LGE assessment and Prostate Imaging – Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scoring. For each lesion, semi-quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI was performed and the following data were evaluated: time to peak, wash-in rate, wash-out rate, brevity of enhancement, and area under the curve. The presence or absence of LGE in delayed axial T1 images was assessed qualitatively. MRI results were compared to histology. The presence of significant prostate cancer was based both on Epstein criteria (SPC) and Gleason score (GS ≥7). Results: SPC and Gleason score ≥7 tumours showed significant lower time to peak and brevity of enhancement (p<0.001) with higher wash-in rate (p=0.001). LGE was observed in 152/313 (49%) cases; among them 103/152 (68%) did not show SPC whereas 49/152 (32%) had SPC (p<0.001). The presence of LGE determined a risk reduction of SPC resulting as an independent predictor at multivariate analysis (logOR=-0.78, SE 0.33, p=0.02). Conclusion: Semi-quantitative perfusion analysis and LGE may help to predict the presence/absence of a significant prostate tumour and represent a promising tool to improve mpMRI diagnostic performance. © 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists",

    "Abstract": "Copy number alterations (CNAs) of lincRNAs act as one of important mechanisms in disrupting lincRNA expression which may play critical roles during tumorigenesis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The copy number alterations of lincRNAs can mark the spectrum of cancer progression and may serve as biomarkers for prognosis in LUAD, however it is rarely studied. We analyzed RNASeq data for 488 LUAD patients from TCGA portal and 58 healthy subjects to identify prognostic lincRNAs predictive of patient survival. Computational analysis entailing integration of expression and copy number alteration data revealed five prognostic lincRNAs: RBPMS-AS1, TDRKH-AS1, LINC00578, RP11-470 M17.2 and LINC00941. The copy number alterations in the LINC00578 and RP11-470 M17.2 genes were positively associated with the longer overall survival of LUAD patients. The CNA in LINC00941 was negatively associated with the longer overall survival. Copy number amplification significantly correlated with increased expression of TDRKH-AS1, which regulates telomere organization and EZH2-mediated epigenetic silencing of CDKN1A, CDKN1B and IL24. Decreased survival of LUAD patients was associated with high LINC00941 expression. The LINC00941 regulates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, focal adhesion by influencing potential targets, such as KRAS proto-oncogene GTPase and VEGFC. These lincRNA-based prognostic biomarkers may destroy important cancer-related biological processes contributing to LUAD prognosis. In summary, we demonstrate the prognostic potential of four differentially expressed lincRNAs with copy number alterations (RBPMS-AS1, TDRKH-AS1, LINC00578 and RP11-470 M17.2) that are positively associated with longer overall survival of LUAD patients. One differentially expressed lincRNA LINC00941 with copy number alterations was negatively associated with longer overall survival of LUAD patients. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Potassium channels have been proposed to promote cancer cell proliferation and metastases. Thus, we investigated the expression pattern of three 2-pore domain potassium channels (K2Ps) TASK1, TASK3 and TRESK in advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the commonest oral malignancy. Design: We used 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) to induce high grade OSCC in male adult rats. We then used immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to study the distribution and expression pattern of TASK1, TASK3 and TRESK in normal versus cancerous tissue. We also examined the expression of β-tubulin III (β-tub3), a marker associated with resistance to taxane-based chemotherapy and poor patient prognosis, and its correlation with the K2Ps. Finally, we studied the expression of TASK1, TASK3 and TRESK in human samples of SCC of oral origin. Results: We found that TASK3 was significantly up-regulated whereas TASK1 and TRESK were both significantly down-regulated in advanced, poorly differentiated OSCC. Both, rat and human SCC showed a significant increase in the expression of β-tub3. Interestingly, the expression of the latter correlated positively and significantly with TASK3 and TRESK but not TASK1 in rat OSCC. Our initial results showed a similar pattern of up and down regulation and correlation with β-tub3 for these three K2Ps in human SCC. Conclusions: The changes in expression and the co-localization with a marker of resistance to taxanes like β-tub3 turn TASK1, TASK3 and TRESK into potentially new prognostic tools and possibly new therapeutic targets for OSCC. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "A 2-year-old, intact female inland bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) presented with a history of hyperglycemia and nonspecific gastrointestinal signs including frequent regurgitation and diarrhea. Ultrasound and computed tomography revealed the presence of gastric and hepatic masses. A fine needle aspiration biopsy with cytology of the liver revealed neoplastic epithelial cells, which were present in variably sized, crowded, disorganized clusters, surrounded by abundant, intact, and bare nuclei suggesting a fragile cell population. Nuclear chromatin was stippled without prominent nucleoli and the cytoplasm was lightly basophilic and the cells had a high nuclear:cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio. The cytologic diagnosis was a malignant neoplasm of neuroendocrine origin. The diagnostic imaging (ultrasonography, computed tomography) and cytology of a hepatic mass led to the antemortem diagnosis of gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (gNEC). The animal was euthanized due to poor prognosis and diagnosis of gNEC was confirmed with histopathology. Immunohistochemical stains were performed for several neuroendocrine markers, but only somatostatin exhibited mild immunoreactivity in this case. Therefore, fine needle aspiration biopsy with cytology should be considered as a minimally invasive, antemortem diagnostic technique for gNEC in bearded dragons. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Two homodinuclear complexes [Ni2(L)(μ-pz)] (C1) and [Cu2(L)(μ-pz)] (C2) (L = N,N′-bis(3-methoxysalicylidene)-1,3-diamino-2-propanol) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopic methods (UV–vis, 1H NMR and IR) and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of both complexes revealed that two metal atoms were doubly bridged by one alkoxo group as an endogenous bridge and one pyrazolate as exogenous bridge. The arrangement around each metal atom was square planar. Interaction of C1 &amp; C2 with HS-DNA and protein (BSA) was investigated by UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry (CV), circular dichroism (CD) and agarose gel electrophoresis were used in the interaction with DNA. The main mode of binding of the complexes with DNA was intercalation and the affinity of C2 (Kb = 9.73 × 105) to DNA was higher than C1 (Kb = 7.41 × 105). These complexes were also investigated in the interaction with BSA. The calculated binding constants of 1478 for C1 and 39012 for C2 revealed that the binuclear complexes strongly bound to protein (BSA). Beside the experimental investigations, the theoretical calculations of molecular docking were performed to obtain detailed binding information of the complexes to DNA and BSA. Finally, cytotoxic activities were assayed by MTT assay. C2 possesses a prominent cytotoxicity against MCF-7 (human breast cancer) (IC50: 19.45 ± 3.61 μM at 24 h; IC50: 17.07 ± 1.88 μM at 48 h) and LNCaP (human prostate cancer) (IC50: 34.55 ± 7.75 μM at 24 h; IC50: 24.93 ± 6.03 μM at 48 h) cell lines. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Polyp detection rate is a surrogate marker for adenoma detection rate and therefore a surrogate marker of quality colonoscopy. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares distance from the monitor to the endoscopist on polyp detection rate. Methods This was a retrospective study comparing polyp detection rate across two different endoscopy room set-ups. All colonoscopies performed between December 2013 and November 2014 were retrieved. The difference in the room set-up was the distance from the endoscopist to the endoscopy monitor. Room A had a distance of 219 cm and Room B had 147 cm. We used two identical rooms, C and D, as a control arm with a distance of 190 cm between the endoscopist and the monitor. Results There were significant differences in polyp detection rates between Room A and Room B in the bowel cancer screening lists. For these lists, the room with the closest distance from the endoscopist to the monitor (147 cm) had a statistically significant higher polyp detection rate than the room that had a further monitor to endoscopist distance of 219 cm (p<0.0006) and a trend towards a higher polyp detection rate compared with the room where the distance between the monitor and the endoscopist was 190 cm (p=0.08). This effect was not noticed across the service lists. Conclusions This study has suggested that the distance from the endoscopist to the monitor can affect polyp detection rate. It appears that for bowel cancer screening lists, the further the endoscopist from the monitor the lower their polyp detection rate. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

    "Abstract": "Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI using various radiotracers with multiparametric (mp) MRI for detection of primary prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: A systematic literature search up to January 2019 was performed to identify studies that evaluated the diagnostic value of PET/MRI and mpMRI for detection of PCa in the same patient cohorts and had sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables for true-positive (TP), false-positive (FP), false-negative (FN), and true-negative (TN) results. The quality of each study was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, and pooled sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) were calculated. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curves (AUCs) were used to compare the performances of PET/MRI and mpMRI. Results: We identified 9 eligible studies that included a total of 353 patients. PET/MRI had a SEN of 0.783 (95% CI, 0.758–0.807) and a SPE of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.879–0.917), and mpMRI had a SEN of 0.603 (95% CI, 0.574–0.631) and a SPE of 0.887 (95% CI, 0.866–0.906). PET/MRI had a higher AUC than mpMRI (0.9311, 95% CI, 0.8990–0.9632 vs. 0.8403, 95% CI, 0.7864–0.8942; P = 0.0036). There was no notable publication bias, but there was medium heterogeneity in outcomes. The meta-regression analysis showed the major potential cause of heterogeneity was the use of region-based rather than lesion-based analysis. Conclusion: PET/MRI has very good diagnostic performance and outperforms mpMRI for the diagnosis of primary PCa. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: We analysed contemporary pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) trend during radical cystectomy (RC) for urothelial carcinoma of urinary bladder (UCUB), as well as PLND association with cancer specific mortality (CSM) and complications after stratification according to octogenarian vs. younger age. Materials and methods: Within the SEER and NIS databases, respectively 10,427 (T2 and T3 stages) and 19,203 (all T-stages) RC patients (2004–2015) for UCUB were identified. Univariable and multivariable analyses focused on PLND rates, CSM after inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjustment, complication rates, length of stay (LOS) and total hospital charge (THC). Results: Within the SEER database, RC and PLND was performed in 9,406 patients (87.4%), 981 (10.4%) octogenarians and 8,227 younger patients (at, respectively, 83 and 89% PLND). PLND rates increased over time in both patients groups (p < 0.05). PLND was independently associated with lower CSM in both age groups (octogenarians: hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, p < 0.001; younger patients: HR 0.56, p < 0.001). Within the NIS database, PLND was marginally higher associated with overall complications in octogenarians than in younger patients (odd ratio [OR]: 1.32 vs. 1.23, both p < 0.001), with longer LOS (OR: 1.20 vs. 1.08, both p < 0.001), higher THC (relative increase: 6933 vs. 4484, both p < 0.001), but not with higher in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: PLND is associated with lower CSM, but its rate lags in octogenarian vs. younger patients. In both age groups, PLND leads to marginally higher complications, longer LOS and higher THC, but not to higher in-hospital mortality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Lactoferrin hydrolysates (LF-H) were digested using pepsin and modified using a pepsin-catalyzed plastein reaction with tryptophan (Trp) to obtain a target product. LF-H, the target product, plastein reaction-modified LF-H alone, and a mixture of LF-H and Trp were evaluated for their activities with human gastric cancer BGC-823 cells at 24 and 48 h. Assay results indicated that the target product had decreased free amino groups and had incorporated Trp. LF-H and the plastein reaction-modified LF-H alone did not show detectable growth inhibition on BGC-823 cells at 1–3 mg/mL; however, the target product at the same dose levels inhibited cell growth, and showed higher activity than the mixture (P < 0.05). The target product at 2 and 3 mg/mL stopped cell cycle progression at the G0/G1-phase, induced DNA fragmentation, and showed apoptosis induction, which increased the number of apoptotic cells. Moreover, time- and dose-dependent responses were observed in these experiments. RT-PCR assay results indicated that exposure of the cells to the target product resulted in up- and down-regulated mRNA expression for 7 apoptosis-related genes, namely Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bad, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-9. Thus, the plastein reaction increased in vitro anticancer activities of LF-H with BGC-823 cells, and more importantly, both the plastein reaction and Trp incorporation contributed to enhanced activities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the suitability of poly-L-lysine coated magnetic nanoparticles for combined magnetic hyperthermia and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to unify the therapeutic and diagnostic approach. For this purpose, we have synthetized magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles of core diameter ∼10 nm and modified with Poly-L-lysine (PLL) to stabilize the particles and improve their biocompatibility. These modified nanoparticles (MFPLL) were tested for magnetic hyperthermia suitability by calorimetric measurements. Based on the estimated heating rates the specific absorption rates (SAR) for MFPLL particles were calculated. The SAR values of MFPLL particles were about 14–15 Wg−1 at frequency 190 kHz and applied field ∼8 kAm−1. In the MRI parametric mapping measurements we demonstrated the significant effect of MFPLL on transversal relaxation time T2 with the relaxivity r2 equal to 487.94 mM−1 s−1. The combination of the heating properties with the cytotoxic activities of MFPLL and MRI parameters holds great promise for the future development of targeted synergistic cancer treatment. Furthermore, as our previous results confirmed the cytotoxic activities of MFPLL in a cell type-dependent manner and the binding to cells expressing carbonic anhydrase (CA IX) when conjugated with the CA IX-specific antibody we have studied the antibody conjugated MFPLL nanoparticles in 3D spheroidal culture. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The rational design of anticancer agents that acts in specific biological targets is one of the most effective strategies for developing chemotherapeutic agents. Aiming at obtaining new ruthenium (II) compounds with good cytotoxicity against tumor cells, a series of new complexes of general formula [RuCl(PPh 3 )(Hdpa)(N–N)]Cl [PPh 3 = triphenylphosphine, N-N = 2,2′-dipyridylamine (Hdpa) (1), 1,2-diaminoethane (en) (2), 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy) (3), 5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (dmbipy) (4), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) (5) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dphphen) (6)] were synthesized. The complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV/Visible, and 1D and 2D NMR) and three of their X-ray structures were determined: [RuCl(PPh 3 )(Hdpa) 2 ]Cl, [RuCl(PPh 3 )(Hdpa)(en)]Cl and [RuCl(PPh 3 )(Hdpa)(dmbipy)]Cl. All the complexes are more cytotoxic against the cancer cell line than against the non-tumor cell line, highlighting complexes 1 and 5, which have an index selectivity of 18 and 15, respectively. The binding constants of compounds 1–6 with human serum albumin (HSA) were determined by tryptophan fluorescence quenching, indicating moderate to strong interactions. The binding mode of the complexes to calf thymus (CT) DNA was explored by several techniques, which reveal that only the dphphen compound 6 causes distortions in the secondary and tertiary structures of DNA. The studies demonstrated that the nature of the N–N co-ligand and the presence of the PPh 3 and Hdpa ligands are features that can influence the binding affinity of the complexes by the biomolecules and in the cytotoxic activity of the complexes. Overall, the complexes with diimine co-ligand are much more cytotoxic than compound 2 with the aliphatic diamine. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we aim to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) rates and side effects of induction chemotherapy based on docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF) versus cisplatin and fluorouracil (PF) in patients with locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received subsequent chemoradiotherapy. We randomly assigned 278 patients with stage III or IV NPC (without distant metastases) to receive either TPF or PF induction chemotherapy, followed by cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy every 3 weeks and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for 5 days per week. After a minimum of 2 years follow-up, a PFS benefit was observed for TPF compared to PF, though this difference was not statistically significant (84.5% vs. 77.9%, P =.380). Due to increased frequencies of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and diarrhea, significantly more patients in the TPF group required treatment delays and dose modifications. Our findings suggest that PF induction chemotherapy has substantially better tolerance and compliance rates than TPF induction chemotherapy. However, the treatment efficacy of PF is not superior to TPF induction chemotherapy in patients with locoregionally-advanced NPC (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01536223). © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) accounts for 85% of thyroid carcinoma, which is the most common endocrine tumor. For the diagnosis of PTC, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) with pathological evaluation is the standard test and BRAF V600E mutation is the most common molecular marker associated with the occurrence, progression and poor clinicopathological characteristics of PTC. However, because of the small amount of the tumor cells obtained by FNA for pathological evaluation or BRAF V600E mutation detection, more sensitive and accurate methods are required. Our study aimed to investigate the performance of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in detecting BRAF V600E mutation in FNA samples from PTC patients. Methods: One hundred and sixty suspected thyroid cancer patients were enrolled, including 146 PTC patients, 2 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and 12 benign patients, identified by FNA biopsy according to the NCCN clinical practice guidelines of Thyroid Carcinoma. ddPCR and amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS, AmoyDx) were used to detect BRAFV600E mutation and the results were compared. Results: ddPCR had high reproducibility (CV 0.01% = 14.78% and CV 10% = 4.85%) and the detection sensitivity can reach 2–3 copies/μl (0.06%). Among the 146 PTC patients, 142 BRAF V600E mutations were detected, including 5 ARMS negative patients and 2 benign cases. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that ddPCR could be used in detecting BRAF V600E mutation from FNA fluid samples with higher sensitivity and accuracy than ARMS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary malignant bone tumor with high morbidity. Developing new therapeutic approaches with neoadjuvant is of great interest in OS treatment. Reportedly, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ataxia telangiectasia and radiation resistance gene 3 related (ATR)-p53 signaling is considered as a critical DNA damage signaling pathway sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapies; while wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1), an oncogene overexpressed in diverse cancers, has been regarded as a critical inhibitor in the ATM/ATR-p53 DNA damage signaling pathway. Herein, the expression of WIP1 in OS tissues and cell lines was examined; to investigate the mechanism of WIP1 abnormal upregulation, online tools were used to predict the upstream regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting WIP1. Among the candidate miRNAs, the expression and detailed function of miR-590 were validated. Through binding to the 3′-untranslated region of WIP1, miR-590 inhibited WIP1 expression and, therefore, enhanced the effect of Dox on OS cell proliferation and apoptosis through downstream ATM-p53 signaling. Moreover, RELA could bind to the promoter region of miR-590 to inhibit its expression, thereby affecting downstream WIP1 and ATM-p53 signaling. The expression of p65 was upregulated in OS tissues, indicating that the effect of p65 inhibition on cell viability, apoptosis, and related mechanisms could be partially restored by miR-590 inhibition. Taken together, these results showed that p65-mediated miR-590/WIP1/ATM-p53 modulation might be a novel target to enhance the cellular effect of Dox on OS cell lines. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The US population of inmates continues to increase along with a rapid escalation in the number of elderly prisoners. Previous studies have demonstrated multiple barriers to providing palliative care for seriously ill inmates. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of palliative care consultation and nature of consultation requests for inmates who died while hospitalized at a large tertiary care hospital. A retrospective chart review of all inmate decedents over a 10-year time period was conducted. The reason and timing of consultation was noted in addition to symptoms identified and interventions recommended by the palliative care team. Characteristics of patients who were transferred to the inpatient palliative care unit were also recorded. Forty-five percent of inmates were seen by palliative care prior to their death. Timing of consultation was close to the day of death. Inmates with cancer were significantly more likely to have a palliative care consultation prior to death. The most frequent intervention recommended was opiates for pain or dyspnea. Delirium was often missed by the primary team but was identified by the palliative care team. Nearly, 5000 prisoners die each year, mostly in community hospitals. These patients exhibit similar symptoms to free-living patients. Given that the inmate population has a higher rate of comorbid conditions, there is a need for more research to identify areas of need for incarcerated patients and where palliative care can best serve these individuals. © The Author(s) 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Quality of life outcomes provide essential information for patients and physicians in oncology care. However, the validity of progression-free survival (PFS) as a surrogate for quality of life, and the inclusion and reporting of quality of life endpoints in clinical trials, is unclear. We performed a retrospective study of phase III clinical trials of drugs for advanced or metastatic solid tumors published between 2010 and 2015. Correlation coefficient (r) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for association between PFS and positive quality of life were evaluated. Of the 352 Phase 3 trials included, 190 (54%) included a quality of life endpoint, of which 23% did not report pre-specified quality of life outcomes; a total of 125,962 patients were enrolled in studies lacking, or not reporting, quality of life outcomes. Among the 147 trials that reported quality of life outcomes, 99 (67%) reported no effect, 38 (26%) reported a positive effect and 10 (7%) reported a negative effect of treatment on patients’ global quality of life. The association between PFS and improvement in global quality of life was weak (r = 0.34; AUC = 0.72), as was the association between PFS and improvement in any domain of quality of life. In conclusion, PFS benefit was not strongly correlated with improvements in patients’ quality of life, and, despite the palliative intent of treatments in the advanced/metastatic setting, the availability of quality of life data from clinical trials of cancer drugs was poor. © 2018 UICC",

    "Abstract": "Prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a rare histologic subtype of prostate cancer characterized by large glands lined with tall columnar pseudostratified epithelium. PDA has several architectural patterns, with papillary and cribriform being the most common. The cribriform pattern of acinar carcinoma has shown to be associated with a worse prognosis in terms of disease progression and disease-specific mortality. However, the significance of cribriform pattern in PDA is unknown. In this study, we sought to compare the adverse pathologic features between cribriform-type and non-cribriform-type PDA, and between PDA and acinar carcinoma with Gleason scores 8–10. We identified PDA cases diagnosed between 2008 and 2018 and 428 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens containing Gleason 8–10 acinar carcinoma. The slides of all PDA cases were reviewed, and pathologic features were recorded. We found that the vast majority of PDA contained admixed acinar carcinoma, with a median percentage of the ductal component of 50% (range 5–100). 29% of PDA was graded as Grade Group 4 and 35.5% as Grade Group 5. At the time of RP, 45.2% of cases presented as pathologic stage T3a and 29% as T3b. Cribriform-type PDA demonstrated a significantly higher likelihood of extraprostatic extension (84% vs 33.3%, p = 0.01), seminal vesical invasion (36% vs 0%, p = 0.04), lymphovascular invasion (40% vs 0%, p = 0.03) and advanced pathologic stage (84% vs 33.3%, p = 0.01) compared to PDA without cribriform architecture. The proportion of stage ≥pT3 tumors in PDA was similar compared to that in Gleason 8–10 acinar carcinoma (74.2% vs 70.8%, p = 0.68). © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Parental age has been associated with several childhood cancers, albeit the evidence is still inconsistent. Aim: To examine the associations of parental age at birth with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) among children aged 0–14 years using individual-level data from the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC) and non-CLIC studies. Material/methods: We analyzed data of 3182 incident AML cases and 8377 controls from 17 studies [seven registry-based case-control (RCC) studies and ten questionnaire-based case-control (QCC) studies]. AML risk in association with parental age was calculated using multiple logistic regression, meta-analyses, and pooled-effect estimates. Models were stratified by age at diagnosis (infants <1 year-old vs. children 1–14 years-old) and by study design, using five-year parental age increments and controlling for sex, ethnicity, birthweight, prematurity, multiple gestation, birth order, maternal smoking and education, age at diagnosis (cases aged 1–14 years), and recruitment time period. Results: Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived from RCC, but not from the QCC, studies showed a higher AML risk for infants of mothers ≥40-year-old (OR = 6.87; 95% CI: 2.12–22.25). There were no associations observed between any other maternal or paternal age group and AML risk for children older than one year. Conclusions: An increased risk of infant AML with advanced maternal age was found using data from RCC, but not from QCC studies; no parental age-AML associations were observed for older children. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Afatinib, a second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is used for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there are few reports about its resistance mechanisms. The aims of this study are to evaluate resistance mechanisms of afatinib compared with other TKIs and analyze the performance of repeat biopsy which is critical for subsequent treatment. Materials and methods: We screened EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who started first-line afatinib, gefitinib, or erlotinib from 2014 to 2016, and included patients who acquired resistance. Among those patients, T790 M mutation rates and histologic transformation were compared as an acquired resistance mechanism. Results: A total of 524 patients started EGFR-TKIs, and 347 experienced disease progression until April 2018. After excluding nine patients with de novo T790 M mutations or who were treated with two TKIs before repeat biopsy, 338 patients were included. Among these patients, 263 (78%) were successfully biopsied and evaluated for EGFR mutations and histologic transformation. T790 M mutation was documented in 35 (41%) of 86 evaluable patients in afatinib group, which is significantly lower than in gefitinib (55%, 73/133) and erlotinib groups (57%, 25/44) (p = 0.026). In multivariate analysis considering both baseline EGFR mutation types (deletion 19 or L858R) and sex, the odds ratio for T790M in afatinib group was 0.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.254-0.795, p = 0.006), compared with gefitinib or erlotinib groups. Five histologic transformations (two small cell, three squamous cell) were detected in afatinib group, while one small cell transformation was detected in gefitinib group, and no transformations were detected in erlotinib group. Conclusions: In our clinical practice, repeat biopsy was possible in nearly four of five patients. Although T790 M mutation appears to be the main resistance mechanism for afatinib, it affects a lower proportion of patients than observed with first-generation TKIs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotyping is an automated technique for identifying patients diagnosed with a particular disease using EHR data. However, EHR-based phenotyping has difficulties in achieving satisfactorily high performance because clinical notes include disease mentions that ultimately signify something other than the patient's diagnosis (such as differential diagnosis or screening). Our objective is to quantify the influence of such disease mentions on EHR-based phenotyping performance. Methods: Physicians manually reviewed whether the disease mentions indicated the patients’ diseases in 487,300 clinical notes of 4,430 patients. Particular focus was placed on disease mentions that did not signify the patient's diagnosis even though they did not have any syntactic modifier or indicator in the same sentences. Patients were then classified according to whether their clinical notes included such disease mentions. Results: Among the patients whose clinical notes included disease mentions without any modifier or indicator, the proportion of patients whose disease mentions signified the patients’ diagnosis was 78.1% (on average). This value can be interpreted as the bias of disease mentions that did not signify the patient's diagnosis on the precision of EHR-based phenotyping by extracting disease mentions from clinical notes. Conclusion: This study quantified the bias occurred owing to disease mentions that incorrectly signify a patient's diagnosis in the value of precision of EHR-based phenotyping from four dataset types. The results of this study will help researchers in diverse research environments with different available data types. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, SBRT) is widely used in oligometastatic cancer, but the heterogeneity of the population complicates estimation of the prognosis. We investigated the role of different clinical and inflammatory parameters. Materials and methods: We included all patients treated with SRT for 1–5 oligometastases between 2003 and 2017 in our center. Patients were randomized between a model training set (2/3) and a separate validation set (1/3). A Cox regression model was built, validated and risk points were attributed to the resulting parameters. Results: 403 patients received SRT for 760 metastases. Treated sites were mainly lung, liver, nodal areas, and brain. Most common primaries were colorectal and lung cancer. Median follow-up for living patients reached 42 months and median overall survival (MS) was 26.6 months (95% CI 23.8–29.3). Five independent adverse factors were discriminated: male sex, synchronous timing of oligometastases, brain metastasis, non-adenocarcinoma histology, KPS <80. A risk score is formed by summation of the points of each factor (M:4, T:2, B:7, N:7, K:8). Four risk groups were defined: (1) 0–2 points: MS 41.2 months (95% CI 30.2–52.3); (2) 3–8 points: 29.3 months (24.6–34.0); (3) 9–13 points: 17.4 months (10.1–24.7), and (4) 14–28 points: 7.9 months (5.5–10.3). Conclusion: We propose a prognostic score applicable in a variety of primary tumors and disease locations, including presence of brain metastases. The nomogram and risk groups can be used to stratify patients in new trials and to support individualized care for oligometastatic patients.

    "Abstract": "Tocotrienols (T3s) are a subgroup of vitamin E and they have been widely tested to inhibit cell growth in various tumor types. Previous studies have shown that T3s inhibit cancer cell growth by targeting multiple signaling transduction and cellular processes. However, the role of T3s in the regulation of cellular bioenergetic processes remains unclear. In this study, we found that γ-T3 interacts with mitochondrial electron transfer chain NDUFB8 (a subunit of complex I) and SDHB (a subunit of complex II) and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and triggers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we observed that γ-T3 upregulates the glycolytic capacity in cells, but it did not compensate for cellular ATP generation and decreased the ATP levels in cells. Furthermore, we performed western blots and RT-PCR to measure the mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC) proteins and complex V (ATP synthase), where the results indicated that γ-T3 specifically inhibited the levels of NDUFB8 and SDHB, whereas it had little effect on UQCRC2 (a subunit of complex III), COX4I1 (a subunit of complex IV), and ATP5F1A (a subunit of complex V). The inhibition of NDUFB8 and SDHB by γ-T3 led to the overproduction of ROS and the depletion of ATP, which may be responsible for inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Our results suggest that mitochondrial respiration may be an effective target for anticancer treatments based on γ-T3. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Immunotherapy with DCs as antigen-presenting vehicles have already improved patients’ outcome against a variety of tumors. Moreover, MSCs were recently used to develop anti-cancer therapeutic or anti-microbial prophylactic vaccines. The current study evaluated immune responses and anti-tumor effects generated by DCs and MSCs derived from mouse bone marrow which were modified with small heat shock proteins 27 and 20 (sHsp27 and sHsp20) and also E7 oncoprotein in tumor mouse model. Two vaccination strategies were utilized including homologous DC or MSC prime/ DC or MSC boost, and heterologous MSC or DC prime/ protein boost vaccinations. Our data revealed that DCs pulsed with E7+Hsp27 and/or E7+Hsp20 in homologous and heterologous prime/ boost vaccinations could stimulate high levels of IgG2a, IgG2b, IFN-γ and IL-10 directed toward Th1 responses. Moreover, these regimens induced an increased level of Granzyme B, and displayed complete protection more than 60 days after treatment. On the other hand, MSCs transfected with E7+Hsp27 DNA in homologous and heterologous prime/ boost vaccinations could significantly enhance the E7-specific T-cell responses and suppress tumor growth in mice. However, MSCs transfected with E7+Hsp20 DNA did not induce a complete protection against TC-1 tumor compared to DCs pulsed with E7+Hsp20 protein complexes. These results indicated that DC- and MSC-based vaccinations with specific modalities will be a useful approach for immunotherapy and protection against HPV-associated cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and common type of human primary brain tumor. Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) have been proposed to contribute to tumor initiation, progression, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance of GBM. Therefore, targeting GSCs could be a promising strategy to treat this refractory cancer. Calmodulin (CaM), a major regulator of Ca 2+ -dependent signaling, controls various cellular functions via interaction with multiple target proteins. Here, we investigated the anticancer effect of hydrazinobenzoylcurcumin (HBC), a Ca 2+ /CaM antagonist, against GSCs derived from U87MG and U373MG cells. HBC significantly inhibited not only the self-renewal capacity, such as cell growth and neurosphere formation but also the metastasis-promoting ability, such as migration and invasion of GSCs. HBC induced apoptosis of GSCs in a caspase-dependent manner. Notably, HBC repressed the phosphorylation of Ca 2+ /CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), c-Met, and its downstream signal transduction mediators, thereby reducing the expression levels of GSC markers, such as CD133, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4. In addition, the knockdown of CaMKIIγ remarkably decreased the cancer stem cell-like phenotypes as well as the expression of stemness markers by blocking c-Met signaling pathway in U87MG GSCs. These results suggest that HBC suppresses the stem-like features of GBM cells via downregulation of CaM/CaMKII/c-Met axis and therefore CaMKII may be a novel therapeutic target to eliminate GSCs. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Nivolumab is widely used to treat several late-stage malignancies such as melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer by inhibiting the interaction between the programmed cell death protein-1 and its ligand. By stimulating an antitumor immune response, it also leads to immune adverse events. Here. we report two cases of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) induced by nivolumab. Case 1: a 72-year-old woman with a stage IV melanoma. Two months after nivolumab discontinuation because of autoimmune hepatitis, the patient was in complete remission and pruritic nummular erythematous plaques appeared on the back and arms. Case 2: a 43-year-old man put under nivolumab for a metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. After two cycles, an annular erythematous eruption appeared on the hands, arms, and chest. The hypothesis of SCLE was confirmed by biopsies showing lymphoid perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, with scarce C3 deposits along the basal layer of the epidermis in patient 2. Both patients tested positive for antinuclear antibodies and anti-SSA antibodies. Lesions were regressive under topical corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine for the first patient and oral prednisone for the second patient. No systemic involvement was observed. The occurrence of SCLE 2 months after nivolumab discontinuation is evidence that the drug effect is prolonged because of the maintenance of programmed cell death protein-1 reception saturation for months. A causal relationship between SCLE and nivolumab is suggested by (i) the occurrence of SCLE after at least two cycles, (ii) the regression of lesions following treatment with corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine, and (iii) the fact that it appeared after remission in our first patient.",

    "Abstract": "Ozonated-microbubble (O3-MB) was applied to remove 39 pharmaceuticals in 10 therapeutic classes (ant-ivirals, anti-bacterials, anti-cancer drugs, psychotropics, anti-hypertensives, analgesic-antipyretics, contrast media, bronchodilators, anti-pruritics, and herbal medicines) in water and the results were compared with those given by O3 alone and combined treatments with UV, and/or H2O2, or both. The summarized results clearly indicate that O3-MB based treatments significantly (P &lt; 0.01) enhanced removal rates by 8–34% to O3 alone, and removal rates of &gt;90% (&gt;80%) were attained for 33 (37) compounds. Introduction of MB technology was indispensable to improve degradation of famciclovir (anti-viral), bicalutamide (anti-cancer), sulpiride (phychotropic) and acetaminophen glucuronide (analgesic-antipyretic) over 96.0%. Recalcitrant properties of all contrast media type compounds (iohexol, ioversol, iopromide, iomeprol and iopamidol) agains t both O3 and O3-MB were significantly improved by combined treatment with UV, and removal rates became 93.8–98.8% from 0% to 52.0%, indicating effectiveness of combined use of photolysis more than oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. Combination of UV and/or H2O2 with O3-MB increased the reaction rate constant by 2.9–5.5 times in average relative to O3 and O3-MB. In addition, MB treatment improved O3 consumption up to 2.8 times higher than the O3 treatments. These results indicate that the combined treatments of O3-MB with UV and/or H2O2 could minimize the environmental pollutant load of pharmaceuticals discharged into rivers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation which showed enhancement of removal rates of multiple pharmaceuticals together with combined use of UV and/or H2O2. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Fluorescent probes have been valuable tools for bioanalytical multiplex assays. However, as a common phenomenon in multiplex fluorescence assays, spectral overlap usually leads to difficulty in spectral analysis for multiple analytes. Although multiway calibrations have provided mathematic approaches for complex spectral analysis, it remains a grand challenge for these methods in practical applications because of the problems such as prior rank estimation. Herein, we report a novel second-order calibration algorithm of alternating residual trilinearization (ART) for the decomposition of complex spectra generated from multiplex fluorescence assays. By alternating iterative convergence to the spectral profiles of each component in convergence process, ART enables automatic rank estimation for second-order calibration, thus able to avoid the risk of chemical meaningless fitting of component spectra. Combined with fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, the performance of ART has been demonstrated by a simulated example and an analytical experiment performed using molecular beacons (MBs) for the simultaneous assay of three breast cancer related DNA targets. The results revealed that the proposed algorithm is capable of automatic estimating the number of underlying components during its convergence process to produce acceptable performance in spectral profile resolution and concentration estimation. Compared with other existing iterative trilinear decomposition strategies such as parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) requiring a prior rank estimation, the proposed ART therefore provides a robust second-order calibration strategy for complex spectral analysis in multiplex fluorescence assays. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX) (RS) informs systemic therapy decision making in ER-positive HER2-negative early breast cancer (BC). To date no study has described the more nuanced discussions that take place regarding systemic therapy or the impact of the RS on concordance in such decision making. Here we utilized a novel decision making tool to assess the impact of the RS on decision making as well as concordance of treatment recommendations. Patients and methods: The clinicopathological information (CPI) of 50 BCs without and with the RS were presented to a panel of breast oncologists in a simulated MDT. The Liverpool Adjuvant Systemic Therapy Decision Tool (LASTDT) was developed and used to categorize treatment recommendations. Outcome measures included the impact of the RS on decisiveness and concordance in decision making and its impact on treatment recommendations. Results: Availability of the RS increased definitive decision making from 8% (4/50) to 56% (28/50) [χ 2 = 79.35, p &lt; 0.001] and altered the LASTDT category in 68% (34/50) of cases (p &lt; 0.001), 74% of which were to forgo chemotherapy. With knowledge of RS, universal concordance rose from 14% to 64% [K = 0.328: K = 0.729]. Conclusions: The RS improves certainty of decision making as well as concordance amongst oncologists. This provides evidence that the availability of the RS can improve consistency of decision making amongst oncologists and thus helps to ensure patients are managed consistently. This is particularly important when patients are managed in a loco-regional, multidisciplinary team manner where heterogeneous decisions can lead to disparity in care. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Targeted tumor imaging and efficient specific gene delivery in vivo has been one of the main challenges in gene-based cancer diagnosis and therapy. Herein, we engineered a citric acid-based polymer with intrinsical photoluminescence and gene loading capacity to achieve targeted delivery of siRNA and tumor imaging in vitro and in vivo. The multifunctional platform was formed from the self-assembling of poly (citric acid)-polymine conjugated with folic acid and rhodamine B (PPFR). PPFR showed stable photoluminescent ability and could effectively bind and protect the siRNA against RNase degradation. PPFR also exhibited good blood compatibility and cell compatibility against C2C12, MCF-7 and A549. Compared with commercial transfection agent Lipofectamine™ 2000, PPFR had a high cellular uptake, equivalent transfection efficiency and effectively down-regulated intracellular p65 expression in A549 cancer cells. Importantly, PPFR could efficiently accumulate and label the tumor tissue through the fluorescent imaging, selectively deliver siRNA into tumor tissue in vivo based on the tumor-bearing nude mice model. This work may provide a facile strategy to synthesize multifunctional biocompatible biomaterials for targeted tumor imaging and gene therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Hypopharyngeal carcinoma has a very poor prognosis. The high incidence of second esophageal neoplasia is one of the major causes. To establish an efficient follow-up scheme for increasing the diagnostic yield and reducing the adverse impact of second esophageal neoplasia on survival, the purpose of this study was to explore a biomarker to predict second esophageal neoplasia. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive tissue specimens from those patients who underwent tumor resection between September 2007 and October 2015 were collected. Gene amplification was performed by real-time PCR. The expression of cortactin was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The predictive risk factors of developing second esophageal neoplasia and prognostic factors related to survival were analyzed. Results: A total of 187 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 48 months (12–118 months). Second esophageal tumors were found in 53 (28.3%), including 41 (21.9%) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 12 severe dysplasia. The results of multivariate analyses revealed that age (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.16–6.78), cortactin overexpression (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.17–5.33), and stage IV versus I (OR 6.49, 95% CI 1.68–25.18) were independent predictors of second esophageal neoplasia, and second esophageal neoplasia (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05–3.01) was an independent predictor of overall survival. Conclusion: This is the first report to identify a potential biomarker for predicting second esophageal neoplasia in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. In those patients with cortactin overexpression and younger age (≤60 years old), close surveillance for second esophageal neoplasia is required. In addition, the real effect of cortactin overexpression on development of primary esophageal carcinoma is required to be validated in a large cohort study. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: A thorough understanding of local and contemporary invasive fungal infection (IFI) epidemiology in immunocompromised children is required to provide a rationale for targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Methods: Retrospective data over 10 years from four tertiary pediatric oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) units across Australia were analyzed to report demographic, clinical, and mycological characteristics of IFI episodes, and crude IFI prevalence in select oncology/HSCT groups. Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were used to calculate 180-day overall survival. Results: A total of 337 IFI episodes occurred in 320 children, of which 149 (44.2%), 51 (15.1%), and 110 (32.6%) met a modified European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (mEORTC) criteria for proven, probable, and possible IFI, respectively. There were a further 27 (8.0%) that met a “modified possible IFI” criteria. Median age at IFI diagnosis was 8.4 years. Crude mEORTC IFI prevalence in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, solid tumor, and allogeneic HSCT cohorts was 10.6%, 28.2%, 4.4%, and 11.7%, respectively. Non-Aspergillus species represented 48/102 (47.1%) molds identified, and non-albicans Candida represented 66/93 (71.0%) yeasts identified. There were 56 deaths among 297 children who met mEORTC criteria, with 180-day overall survival for proven, probable, and possible IFIs of 79.7%, 76.2%, and 84.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Non-Aspergillus molds and non-albicans Candida contributed substantially to pediatric IFI in our study, with high IFI prevalence in leukemia and allogeneic HSCT cohorts. Inclusion of IFIs outside of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria revealed an IFI burden that would go otherwise unrecognized in published reports. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: End-of-life discussions (EOLd) including the option of forgoing anticancer treatment infrequently occur until treatment options have been exhausted for advanced cancer patients. We aimed to identify oncologist-related factors contributing to the timing of discussing the option of forgoing anticancer treatment. Methods: In this nationwide survey of 864 medical oncologists, we asked about physicians’ attitudes toward the timing of discussing the option of forgoing anticancer treatment for a simulated patient with newly diagnosed metastatic cancer, physicians’ experience of EOLd, perceptions of a good death, and beliefs. Multivariate analyses identified determinants of early discussions. Results: Among 490 physicians (response rate = 57%), 167 (35%) would discuss the option of forgoing anticancer treatment “now (at the diagnosis).” Physicians’ attitudes toward discussing the option “now” were significantly correlated with a greater physician-perceived importance of life completion (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.00–1.69, p = 0.048) and dying in a preferred place (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.01–1.65, p = 0.045) for a good death, and not perceiving EOLd as being severely distressing for patients/families (OR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.54–0.95, p = 0.021). In multivariate analyses, independent determinants of the attitude toward discussing the option now included a greater physician-perceived importance of life completion for a good death (OR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.05–1.81, p = 0.019), and not perceiving EOLd as being severely distressing for patients/families (OR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.52–0.94, p = 0.017). Conclusions: Reflection by oncologists on their own perception regarding a good death and beliefs about EOLd may help oncologists individualize the timing of discussing the option of forgoing anticancer treatment. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, new therapeutic possibilities were proposed for cardiac glycosides traditionally used to treat heart diseases, such as anticancer and antiviral activities. In this sense, this work aimed to synthesize the readily accessible 3β-azido-3-deoxydigitoxigenin (5) from digitoxigenin (1). Two new series of compounds were obtained from derivative (5): (i) O-glycosyl trizols through click chemistry with propargyl glycosides; and (ii) compounds substituted in the alpha carbonyl position with different residues linked via an amino-group. All obtained derivatives have their chemical structures confirmed, and their anti-herpes (against HSV-types 1 and 2 replication) and cytotoxic (against PC3, A549, HCT-8 and LNCaP cell lines) activities evaluated. Compounds 10 and 11 exhibited the most promising results against HSV-1 (KOS and 29-R strains) and HSV-2 (333 strain) replication with SI values &gt; 1000. Both compounds were also the most cytotoxic for the human cancer cell lines tested with IC 50 values similar to those of paclitaxel. They also presented reduced toxicity toward non-cancerous cell lines (MRC-5 and HGF cells). Promising compounds were tested in regard to their ability to inhibit Na + /K + -ATPase. The inhibition rate correlates suitably with the bioactivity demonstrated by those both compounds against the different human cancer cells tested as well as against HSV replication. Moreover, the results showed that specific chemical features of compound 10 and 11 influenced the bioactivities tested. In summary, it was possible to obtain novel digitoxigenin-derivatives with remarkable cytotoxic and anti-herpes activities as well as low toxicity and high selectivity. In this way, they could be considered potential molecules for the development of new drugs. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a novel and efficient aptasensor based on immobilization of thiol terminated prostate specific antigen (PSA) binding DNA aptamer onto Au nanoparticles/fullerene C 60 -chitosan-ionic liquid/multiwalled carbon nanotubes/screen printed carbon electrode has been fabricated for ultrasensitive aptasensing of biomarker PSA. Formation of PSA-aptamer complex caused a variation in electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) and differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) responses of the aptasensor which enabled us to aptasensing of the PSA by EIS and DPV methods. Morphology and electrochemical properties of the fabricated aptasensor were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and EIS. The aptasensor was successfully applied to the determination of PSA by EIS and DPV in the range of 1–200 pg mL −1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 pg mL −1 and 2.5–90 ng mL −1 with a LOD of 1.5 ng mL −1 , respectively. This aptasensor exhibited outstanding anti-interference ability towards co-existing molecules with good stability, sensitivity, repeatability and reproducibility. Practical application of the aptasensor was examined with analysis of the PSA levels in serum samples obtained from patients with prostate cancer using both the aptasensor and a reference method. The results revealed the proposed system to be a promising candidate for clinical analysis of PSA. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Accurate preoperative assessment of ovarian malignancy in endometrial carcinoma helps in determining the decision to preserve the ovaries in individualized treatment. This study adopted decision tree method to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of pelvic MRI and clinical data of patients for preoperative identification of endometrial carcinoma-combined ovarian malignancy (EC-OM). Material and methods: This retrospective study included a total of 801 patients, and postoperative pathological examinations identified 58 EC-OM group and 743 endometrial carcinoma cases without ovarian malignancy (EC group). Diagnostic efficiency of pelvic MRI in EC-OM was calculated by comparing the clinical data and imaging features of patients in the two groups. Decision tree analysis was performed to screen out associative indexes and establish a diagnostic model for EC-OM. Results: Pelvic MRI showed that, EC-OM group showed deeper invasion into the myometrium, and higher percentages of patients with cervical or cornual involvement, or metastasis of lymph nodes or peritoneum than EC group (P = 0.00). Preoperative pelvic MRI showed a sensitivity of 51.72% and a specificity of 99.87% when detecting ovarian malignancy in endometrial carcinoma. Decision tree model obtained a sensitivity of 89.66%, with an AUC (area under ROC curve) of 0.949 (95% CI 0.906, 0.993, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Decision tree analysis based on pelvic MRI and clinical data of patients showed that the detection rate of ovarian malignancy could be increased for patients with endometrial carcinoma. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Since it was discovered as the first human tumor virus in 1964, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is now implicated in several types of malignancies. Accordingly, certain aspects of EBV pathobiology have shown promise in anti-cancer research in developing virus-targeting methods for EBV-associated cancers. The unique role of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) in triggering episome-dependent functions has made it as the only latent gene to be expressed in most EBV+ neoplasms. Dimeric EBNA1 binds to the replication origin (oriP) to display its biological impact on EBV-driven cell transformation and maintenance. Hence, EBNA1/oriP has been made an ideal drug target site for anti-EBV protocol development. GAP31 protein was originally isolated from the seeds of an ancient medicinal plant Gelonium multiflorum. Although GAP31 has been shown to exhibit both anti-viral and anti-tumor activity, current understanding of the mechanistic picture underlying GAP31 functioning is not clear. Herein, we identify the EBNA1 DNA-binding domain as a core for GAP31 binding by performing affinity pulldown assays. Recombinant GAP31 (rGAP31) was shown to impair EBNA1-induced dimerization; consequently, it abrogated both EBNA1/oriP-mediated binding and transcription. Importantly, the therapeutic effects of GAP31 showed its capability to abrogate EBV-driven cell transformation and proliferation, and EBV-dependent tumorigenesis in xenograft animal models. Notably, the EBNA1 binding-mutant rGAP31 R166A/R169A simply exhibits defective phenotypes in the above-mentioned studies. Our data suggest rGAP31 is a potential anti-viral drug which can be applied to the development of therapeutic strategies against EBV-related malignancies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a globally prevalent malignancy. The molecular mechanisms of this cancer are not well understood and acquire elucidation. Peroxiredoxin like 2A (PRXL2A) has been reported to be an antioxidant protein that protects cells from oxidative stress. Our previous study identified an association between PRXL2A upregulation in OSCC and a worse patient prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in the modulation of biological/pathological properties. The miR-125 family of genes drive pluripotent regulation across a wide variety of cancers. In this study, we identify the oncogenic eligibility of PRXL2A and clarify miR-125b as its upstream regulator. Downregulation of miR-125b can be observed in OSCC tumors. Lower miR-125b expression in tumors results in a worse patient prognosis at the relatively early stage. Reporter assays are able to validate that PRXL2A is a direct target of miR-125b. Exogenous miR-125b expression in OSCC cells results in increased oxidative stress, increased drug sensitivity, and suppressor activity that is paralleled by the knockout of PRXL2A gene. The suppressor activity of miR-125b is able to be rescued by PRXL2A, which suggests the existence of a miR-125b-PRXL2A regulatory axis that is part of OSCC pathogenesis. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) was found to be a downstream effector of the miR-125b-PRXL2A cascade. As a whole, this study has pinpointed novel clues demonstrating that downregulation of miR-125b suppressor underlies upregulation of PRXL2A in OSCC, and this then protects the affected tumor cells from oxidative stress. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Goniodiol, isolated from Goniothalamus species, has previously shown cytotoxic activity in several human cancer cell lines. The purpose of this study was to develop a liposome system to improve the stability and cytotoxic activity of goniodiol. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) were conjugated with acetamide linkage to form PEG-A-DSPE, and with pentanamide linkage to form PEG-P-DSPE. Goniodiol-loaded PEGylated liposomes consisted of goniodiol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid and PEG-A-DSPE or PEG-P-DSPE. It was found that about 40% of goniodiol leaks from conventional liposomes when stored in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), but the PEGylated liposomes containing 5, 10 or 15 mole% of PEG-A-DSPE or PEG-P-DSPE (PEG-P liposome) greatly reduced this leakage. Also, both PEGylated liposomes significantly decreased the degradation of goniodiol in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Interestingly, PEG-P liposome exhibited the lowest leakage amount of goniodiol in PBS and the highest remaining amount of goniodiol in FBS. Additionally, the lowest viability of HepG2 cells was observed after treatment of PEG-P liposome. Our results demonstrate that PEG-P liposome enhances the stability and cytotoxicity of goniodiol by reducing the leakage of goniodiol from liposomes, which suggests that the linkage length between PEG and lipid of PEG-lipid conjugates is an important factor relevant to drug leakage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "New molecular hybrids were synthesized by combining tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) and isoxazole (ISX) scaffolds, in search for chemical structures with improved pharmacological properties. Our tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) and isoxazole (ISX) hybrids differ in the X and Y substituents: FM53 (X = H; Y= H), FM49 (X = CH 3 ; Y= OCH 3 ), FM50 (X = Cl; Y= H) and FM48 (X = Cl; Y= OCH 3 ). Aiming at exploring their bioactivity in liver cancer cells, in this paper we report the effect of four THQ-ISX hybrids on viability, respiration and oxidative stress in Hep-G2 human hepatoma cells. In addition, we measured the alterations induced by these compounds on oxygen uptake and respiratory chain enzymes in isolated mitochondria. Cell viability assay indicated that these THQ-ISX hybrids displayed antiproliferative activity on Hep-G2 cells. Among these, FM50 (IC 50 = 5.2 ± 1.9 μM) and FM53 (IC 50 = 6.8 ± 0.7 μM) had the highest cytotoxicity. These four hybrids also inhibited the Hep-G2 cells respiration in the uncoupled state, with FM50 decreasing all respiratory states (basal, leak, uncoupled). While only FM49 and FM53 altered the Hep-G2 cells redox function. In terms of mitochondrial bioenergetics, THQ-ISX hybrids decreased the oxygen consumption in state 3 (via complex I and II), and also inhibited NADH oxidase and NADH cytochrome c reductase enzyme activities. In these experiments, the structural homologues FM50 and FM53 had a remarkable inhibitory effect (~50%) with respect to FM49 and FM48. These results show that THQ-ISX hybrids are promising compounds for hepatoma cancer treatment and that the phenyl substituent (Y= H) in the ISX scaffold intensifies both, the cytotoxicity in Hep-G2 cells and, inhibition of electron transport through complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "New thiazolylpyrazolyl coumarin derivatives were synthesized and tested for their anticancer potential in vitro against five different human cell lines, including breast MCF-7, lung A549, prostate PC3, liver HepG2 and normal melanocyte HFB4. Breast carcinoma revealed higher sensitivity towards compounds 7a, 8c, 9b, 9c and 9d with IC 50 values ranging from 5.41 to 10.75 μM in comparison to the reference drug doxorubicin (IC 50 = 6.73 μM). In addition, no noticeable toxicity was exhibited towards normal cells HFB4. Moreover, in vitro studies of the VEGFR-2 inhibition in human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line for the promising cytotoxic compounds showed that compounds 7a, 8c, 9b, 9c and 9d were potent inhibitors at low micromolar concentrations (IC 50 = 0.034–0.582 μM) compared to the reference drug, sorafenib (IC 50 = 0.019 μM). Several theoretical and experimental studies were done to reveal the molecular mechanisms that control breast carcinoma metastasis. The mechanistic effectiveness in cell cycle progression, apoptotic induction and gene regulation were assessed for the promising compound 9d due to its remarkable cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and significant VEGFR-2 inhibition. Flow cytometeric analysis showed that compound 9d induced cell growth cessation at G2/M phase and increased the percentage of cells at pre-G1 phase that stimulates the apoptotic death of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, real time PCR assay illustrated that compound 9d up regulated p53 gene expression and elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio which confirmed the mechanistic pathway of compound 9d. Moreover, the apoptotic induction of breast cancer cells MCF-7 was enhanced effectively through activation of caspases-7 and 9 by compound 9d. On the other hand, a set of in silico methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, QSAR analysis as well as ADMET analysis was performed in order to study the protein-ligand interactions and the relationship between the physicochemical properties and the inhibitory activity of the promising compounds 7a, 8c and 9d. Based on the aforementioned findings, compound 9d could be considered as effective apoptosis modulator and promising lead for future development of new anti-breast cancer agents. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant overexpression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is a key feature in oncogenesis and progression of many human cancers. hnRNP K has been found to be a transcriptional activator to up-regulate c-myc gene transcription, a critical proto-oncogene for regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Therefore, down-regulation of c-myc transcription by inhibiting hnRNP K through disrupting its binding to c-myc gene promoter is a potential approach for cancer therapy. In the present study, we synthesized and screened a series of Quinoline derivatives and evaluated their binding affinity for hnRNP K. Among these derivatives, (E)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(4-morpholino-6-nitroquinolin-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (compound 25) was determined to be the first-reported hnRNP K binding ligand with its K D values of 4.6 and 2.6 μM measured with SPR and MST, respectively. Subsequent evaluation showed that the binding of compound 25 to hnRNP K could disrupt its unfolding of c-myc promoter i-motif, resulting in down-regulation of c-myc transcription. Compound 25 showed a selective anti-proliferative effect on human cancer cell lines with IC 50 values ranged from 1.36 to 3.59 μM. Compound 25 exhibited good tumor growth inhibition in a Hela xenograft tumor model, which might be related to its binding with hnRNP K. These findings illustrated that inhibition of DNA-binding protein hnRNP K by compound 25 could be a new and selective strategy of regulating oncogene transcription instead of targeting promoter DNA secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes or i-motifs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Aim: Main objective of this study is mapping of the anticancer efficacy of synthesized gallic acid analogues using modeling and artificial intelligence (AI) over a large range of concentrations and exposure times to explore the underline mechanisms of drug action and draw careful inferences regarding drug response heterogeneity. Methods: Two series of gallic acid derivatives i.e. esters and amides have been synthesized and characterized by FTIR, NMR and mass spectrometry. The compounds have been tested in vitro for their anticancer activity against wild type human ovarian cancer cell line A2780, prostate cancer cell line PC3 and normal human fibroblast cells 3T3. To completely characterize optimal anticancer activity, a comprehensive model using piecewise recursive Hill model is used to quantitatively assess the in vitro anticancer effect of the tested compounds as a function of concentration and exposure time for periods ranging from 24 to 72 h. A robust artificial intelligence approach i.e. the “Support Vector Machine (SVM) Learning Algorithm” is adopted to utilize the data obtained at different temporal values, to identify compounds that trail forecasting algorithm. Results: All the synthesized analogues were found biocompatible. Significantly low EC 50 values indicated that tested compounds have potent anticancer activity against A2780 cell line in comparison to PC3 cells where only few compounds generated same impact at almost 200 times high dose. On the basis of EC 50 values, compounds 7 h, 7 m, 9c, 9b, 7c, 7b and 7 g were identified as the most active anticancer agent against A2780. Three major patterns of drug response heterogeneity were observed for different compounds in the form of multiple Hill graphs and shallow slopes. The anticancer efficiency of the compounds was verified using Machine learning SVM regression learner algorithm. For compounds 7a, 7b, 7e, 7 g, 7o, 7 r, 9b, 9e-9 g higher accuracy was found in predicted and experimentally obtained end point potency in terms of % viability. Conclusions: Pharmacodynamics modeling of anticancer potential of the synthesized compounds revealed that drug efficacy and response heterogeneity could be modulated by changing the exposure time to optimize therapeutic impact. Combining experimental results with AI based drug action forecasting, compounds 7b, 7 g, and 9b may be tested further as potent anticancer agent for in vivo studies. This approach may serve a useful tool for extrapolation of in vitro results for generating lead compounds in in vivo and preclinical studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Glycyrrhetinic acid has been usually studied for their anti-tumor activities. However, the low bioavailability and poor aqueous solubility as well as limited intracellular accumulation have limited their utility. In this present study, a series of new glycyrrhetinic acid conjugates with a triphenylphosphonium cation (TTP + ) moiety, meant to specifically target them to tumor cells mitochondria, have been designed and synthesized. Among them, compound 2f possessed excellent antitumor activities against the tested human cancer cells, and simultaneously exhibited better cell selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells than glycyrrhetinic acid and HCPT. Moreover, 2f significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and effectively inhibited cancer cells proliferation and migration. Mechanism studies revealed that 2f triggered apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway via the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Eleven major phthalic acid esters (PAEs) congeners were analyzed for PM 2.5 samples collected at Mount Tai, a high elevation mountain site in northern China from June to August 2015. The results showed that the average concentration of PAEs in PM 2.5 was 19.48 ng m −3 , and bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) were the predominant species in particle-phase, whereas diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP) were the prevailing PAEs in gas-phase. PAE concentrations decreased at the beginning of cloud/fog events, while they increased after the cloud/fog events since the liquid-phase PAEs could be absorbed by solid-phase PAEs. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the highest PSCF value of air masses were mainly sourced from southwest of Mount Tai and multiple sources contributed to PAEs. A Monte Carlo simulation was applied to estimate the incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCR) from inhalation exposure on the basis of DEHP concentrations. The estimated values of ILCR for the general population were lower than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency threshold, which is 10 −6 . However, since the local population was exposed to various local emission sources, the actual health risk is undervalued. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Evidence is rapidly accumulating for the use of radical consolidative treatment (RCT) for patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nonetheless, published studies have several limitations, including a selection of patients whose favorable characteristics might dictate therapeutic success, as well as scarce prospective data regarding overall survival (OS). The objective of this study was to determine whether RCT increases OS in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Materials and methods: In this prospective, single-arm phase II study, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of RCT in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC in terms of OS. Patients with pathologically confirmed stage IV NSCLC who presented ≤5 synchronous, any-site metastases (including central nervous system [CNS] metastases), as assessed by PET-CT, were included. All patients received four initial cycles of systemic treatment. Following, those with stable disease/partial response received RCT to the primary site and metastases. The response to RCT was evaluated with PET-CT. The primary end-point was OS. Secondary end-points included progression-free survival (PFS) and best response by PET-CT. The study is registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02805530). Results: Thirty-seven patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 55.8 years (range: 33–75 years). At diagnosis, 43.2% of patients presented with CNS metastases. Following RCT, 19 (51.4%) patients achieved a complete-response (CR) by PET-CT, while 18 (48.6%) had a non-complete response (NON-CR). The median OS was nonreached (NR) and was positively affected by CR on PET-CT (NR vs. 27.4 [95% CI: 16.4–38.3]; p = 0.011). The median PFS was 23.5 months (95% CI: 13.6–33.3) and was positively affected by CR on PET-CT (NR vs. 14.3 [95% CI: 11.7–16.9]; p < 0.001; HR: 0.19 [0.07-0.52]; p=0.001). Conclusion: Patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who undergo RCT have a high response rate and favorable OS. Patients with a CR by PET-CT have significantly longer OS, rendering this an important potential prognostic marker. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "FRAX is a commonly used tool to evaluate patient fracture risk based on individual patient models that integrate the risks associated with clinical risk factors with or without bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck. Retrospectively, factors identified by the FRAX scoring algorithm were used to predict the risk for vertebral compression fractures at baseline in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. The data were derived from myeloma patients enrolled in Total Therapy Protocols (TT4 & TT5) between 8/2008 and 9/2017. FRAX scores were calculated and baseline PET and MRI imaging obtained. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses determined the association between FRAX components and the existence of vertebral compression fractures, both pathologic and osteoporotic. The patient population had a median age of 61 years (43–76), 37% female, and 87% white. The median major osteoporotic score (MOS) and Hip fracture scores (HFS) for TT4 patients (low-risk myeloma) were 5.6 and 0.5, respectively, while median MOS and HFS for TT5 (high risk myeloma) patients were 6.2 and 0.7, respectively. The odds ratio for fracture at diagnosis in patients with elevated MOS (>2), and HFS (>4.5) was significant OR (1.48, 95% confidence interval (1.35,1.62)) and OR (1.61, 95% confidence interval (1.42, 1.81)), respectively. In sum, an elevated baseline FRAX score was highly predictive of baseline vertebral fractures in MM patients at presentation. In addition, patients with higher FRAX scores had significantly shorter survival in the low-risk (TT4) group but this survival effect was not seen in the high-risk (TT5) group. These findings suggest that FRAX assessment of baseline fracture risk is beneficial in MM patients to identify an individual patients’ risk of vertebral fracture. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Mitochondria, which are a major source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and apoptosis regulators, are the key organelles that promote tumor cell proliferation, and their dysfunction affects tumor cell behavior. Additionally, mitochondria have been shown to play a central role in the biosynthesis of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which is a widely used photosensitizer that has been used for tumor detection, monitoring and photodynamic therapy. Nevertheless, photosensitizers administrated exogenously are often restricted by limited bioavailability.δ-Aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA) is a naturally occurring delta amino acid that can be converted in situ to PpIX via the heme biosynthetic pathway in mitochondria. Because δ-ALA is the precursor for PpIX, δ-ALA-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows promise in treating cancer. However, the accumulation of δ-ALA within endosomal system limits the production of PpIX and eventually impedes its effectiveness. Theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) capable of endosomal escape are expected to optimize the endogenous biosynthetic yield. In this study, δ-ALA was improved with triphenylphosphoniumcation (TPP + ), a high net position cation that functions in endosomal escape and as a mitochondria-targeting ligand, and was further modified with bovine serum albumin stabilized manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ). The tumor microenvironment (TME) responsive MnO 2 in this system can elevate oxygen content to relieve hypoxia. Both enhanced photosensitizer yield and elevated oxygen contributing to the final therapeutic effect. Moreover, the enhancement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (r 1 = 5.410 s −1 mM −1 ) stemming from the degradation of MnO 2 by the TME could serve as a guide prior to treatment for accurate location, while in situ hysteretic photoluminescence imaging derived from PpIX can be utilize as a supervisor for prognosis evaluation. This systematic design could broaden the biomedical application and highlight the considerable therapeutic promise of PDT. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Biologically synthesized nanoparticles are rapidly evolving because it is cost effective and eco-friendly, this also contributes to its preference over nanoparticles from other sources. In this study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized from Albuca setosa aqueous bulb (ASB) extracts and the biological activities evaluated. The silver nanoparticles were synthesized from ASB extracts using silver nitrate and characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The antioxidant activity was determined by evaluating the effect on 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid diammonium salt (ABTS). The antibacterial potential was investigated on selected Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria while the cytotoxicity was evaluated on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (ATCC HTB-26). Albuca setosa silver nanoparticles (AS-AgNPs) was formed within 60 min reaction time of UV-Vis absorption. The FTIR showed that acid anhydride, alkene, amine, aldehyde, ester, ketone and carbonyl groups contributed to the synthesis of the AS-AgNPs, while SEM and TEM showed stable irregular shaped monodispersed silver nanoparticles with average size of 7 nm. The XRD patterns revealed diffraction peaks at 54.78â,57.63â,76.91â,85.75â and 92.37â that was indexed to (1 1 0), (1 1 0), (1 0 0), (1 0 0) and (1 0 0) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline structure respectively. The synthesized nanoparticles possess good antioxidant activity with IC50 of 78.89±0.2 and 397.16±1.4μg/ml for DPPH and ABTS, respectively, and inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus with MIC of 25 and 15μg/ml respectively. AS-AgNPs also revealed higher cytotoxic efficacy against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with IC50 of 64.52±1.1μg/ml. AS-AgNPs showed acceptable size and shape of nanoparticles and could therefore be a potential source of antimicrobial and anticancer agents. It can be concluded that the synthesized AS-AgNPs is a good source of anticancer agent with broad spectrum of antibiotic activity. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

    "Abstract": "The study of indoor organic film on planar surfaces has been shown to be important to assess the transport and fate of organic pollutants in indoor environments. Limited research showed the relationship between equilibrium status of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the growth days for indoor window films. To accomplish this goal, indoor window film samples were collected in relation to film growth days in Northeast China. PAHs were frequently detected in window films collected during heating season (H-season), with concentrations significantly higher than that of non-heating season (NH-season). Accumulation characteristics of PAH suggested that PAH concentrations (ng/m 2 film) were growing near-linearly with time. Partitioning status for PAHs between gas and window films under different accumulation stage from 1 to 11 weeks was investigated during the two seasons. The equilibrium status of PAHs in the films suggested that the octanol–air partition coefficient (logK OA ) of the targeted PAHs should be approximately &lt;12 in order to reached the equilibrium stage within 11 weeks of growth. For all the growth days, the proportion of samples that reached equilibrium status for PAHs in the indoor window film samples were further calculated. The total air concentration of the target PAHs were predicted, giving median values of 900 and 240 ng/m 3 in H-season and NH-season, respectively. Human health risk posed by PAHs was calculated in this research showing greater risks found for H-season than NH-season. The estimated incremental lifetime cancer risks were considered as safe with values lower than the WHO recommended guideline. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the brain tumor with the worst prognosis composed of a cell subpopulation called Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells (GSCs) responsible for tumor recurrence mediated by cell invasion. GSCs persist in a hypoxic microenvironment which promotes extracellular adenosine production and activation of the A3 Adenosine Receptor (A3AR), therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of extracellular adenosine and A3AR on GSCs invasion under hypoxia. GSCs were obtained from a U87MG cell line and primary cultures of GBM patients, and then incubated under normoxia or hypoxia. Gene expression was evaluated by RNAseq, RT-qPCR, and western blot. Cell migration was measured by spreading and transwell boyden chamber assays; cell invasion was evaluated by Matrigel-coated transwell, ex vivo brain slice, and in vivo xenograft assays. The contribution of A3AR on cell migration/invasion was evaluated using the A3AR antagonist, MRS1220. Extracellular adenosine production was higher under hypoxia than normoxia, mainly by the catalytic action of the prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), promoting cell migration/invasion in a HIF-2-dependent process. A3AR blockade decreased cell migration/invasion and the expression of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition markers. In conclusion, high levels of extracellular adenosine production enhance cell migration/invasion of GSCs, through HIF-2/PAP-dependent activation of A3AR under hypoxia. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Background: S100A11 (calgizzarin), a member of the S100 family, is associated with oncogenesis, inflammation and myocardial damage. Our aim was to analyse S100A11 in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) and its association with disease activity features and cancer development. Methods: S100A11 in muscle was determined by immunohistochemistry in polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), myasthenia gravis (MG) and in subjects without autoimmune inflammatory disease (HC). S100A11 in plasma was measured in 110 patients with IIMs (PM, DM, and cancer associated myositis (CAM) patients) and in 42 HC. Disease activity was assessed by myositis disease activity assessment (MYOACT), muscle enzymes and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by routine laboratory techniques; autoantibodies by immunoprecipitation or by immunoblot. Results: We observed an accumulation of S100A11 in the cytoplasm of regenerating and necrotizing muscle fibres of PM and DM patients. S100A11 was increased in plasma of all myositis patients compared to HC (3.8 (1.5–16.8) vs 2.8 (1.7–11.2) ng/ml, p = 0.011) and in DM and CAM patients compared to HC (4.0 (2.2–14.9) and 4.5 (1.5–9.1) vs 2.8 (1.7–11.2) ng/ml, p < 0.001 and p = 0.022, respectively). In all myositis patients, S100A11 correlated with the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.256, p = 0.011), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (r = 0.312, p = 0.002), CRP (r = 0.254, p = 0.022) and MYOACT (r = 0.245, p = 0.022). S100A11 was associated with MYOACT (r = 0.377, p = 0.030) and pulmonary and cutaneous disease activity in DM patients (r = 0.408, p = 0.017 and r = 0.417, p = 0.01, respectively). S100A11 was related to the levels of AST (r = 0.412, p = 0.027) in PM and to the levels of creatine phosphokinase (r = 0.432, p = 0.028) in CAM patients. Conclusions: We show for a first time a potential implication of S100A11 in the local inflammatory and tissue remodelling processes in myositis and an association of circulating S100A11 with disease activity and extra muscular manifestations in DM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Combination immunotherapy may result in improved antitumor activity compared with single-agent treatment. We report results from dose-finding and dose-expansion cohorts of the phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-021 study that evaluated combination therapy with anti‒programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab plus anti‒cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab in patients with previously treated advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods: Eligibility criteria stipulated histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC and treatment failure on ≥1 prior systemic therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted therapy for patients with EGFR/ALK aberrations). In the dose-finding cohort, patients initially received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 or 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy for up to 2 years. Based on emerging published data, subsequent patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. Objective response rate (ORR; primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded, independent central review. Phase 2 hypothesis that ORR would be greater than the 20% rate for historical controls was evaluated using the exact binomial test. Results: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 71% received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at any dose level. Among patients who received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 44), ORR was 30% (95% CI, 17%–45%), but not statistically significantly >20% (P = 0.0858). Median progression-free survival in this group was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.4–5.8) months; median overall survival was 10.9 (95% CI, 6.1–23.7) months. With pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, incidences of treatment-related adverse events, grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events, and immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions were 64%, 29%, and 42%, respectively. Conclusions: In patients with heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC, pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab showed evidence of antitumor activity, but was associated with meaningful toxicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The optimal management of melanoma with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) remains unclear. Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) only yields additional positive non-SLN in 20% of cases and its benefits on survival remains debatable. Methods: An online database search of Medline was performed; key bibliographies were reviewed. Studies comparing outcomes after CLND versus observation were included. Odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by random fixed effects models of pooled data were calculated. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Search strategy yielded 117 publications. Twelve studies were selected for inclusion, comprising 7966 SLN-positive patients. Among these patients, 5306 (66.6%) subjects underwent CLND and 2660 (33.4%) patients were observed. Median Breslow thickness and ulceration were similar between groups (2.8 ± 0.6 mm versus 2.5 ± 0.8 mm, P = 0.721; and 38.8% versus 37.2%, P = 0.136, CLND versus observation, respectively). CLND was associated with statistically significant improved 3-y (71.0% versus 66.2%, OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.97, P = 0.02) and 5-y DFS (48.3% versus 47.8%, OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96, P = 0.02) compared with observation. However, no difference was demonstrated in 3-y MSS (83.7% versus 84.7%, OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88-1.35, P = 0.41), 5-y MSS (68.4% versus 69.8%, OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88-1.19, P = 0.78), or OS (68.2% versus 78.9%, OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55-1.57, P = 0.78). Conclusions: Based on this large-scale analysis, CLND improved both 3- and 5-y DFS, possibly because of increased rates of local control; however, this did not translate in improved MSS or OS. Efforts toward the identification of molecular markers associated with poor outcomes in SLN-positive patients who undergo observation are warranted. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Melanoma is a dangerous form of the skin cancer responsible for thousands of deaths every year. Early detection of melanoma is possible through visual inspection of pigmented lesions over the skin, treated with simple excision of the cancerous cells. However, due to the limited availability of dermatologists, the visual inspection alone has the limited and variable accuracy that leads the patient to undergo a series of biopsies and complicates the treatment. In this work, a deep learning method is proposed for automated Melanoma region segmentation using dermoscopic images to overcome the challenges of automated Melanoma region segmentation within dermoscopic images. Materials and methods: A deep region based convolutional neural network (RCNN) precisely detects the multiple affected regions in the form of bounding boxes that simplify localization through Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering. Our method constitutes of three step process: skin refinement, localization of Melanoma region, and finally segmentation of Melanoma. We applied the proposed method on benchmark dataset ISIC-2016 by International Symposium on biomedical images (ISBI) having 900 training and 376 testing Melanoma dermatological images. Main findings: The performance is evaluated for Melanoma segmentation using various quantitative measures. Our method achieved average values of pixel level specificity (SP) as 0.9417, pixel level sensitivity (SE) as 0.9781, F1 _ s core as 0.9589, pixel level accuracy (Ac) as 0.948. In addition, average dice score (Di) of segmentation was recorded as 0.94, which represents good segmentation performance. Moreover, Jaccard coefficient (Jc) averaged value on entire testing images was 0.93. Comparative analysis with the state of art methods and the results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method. Conclusion: In contrast with state of the art systems, the RCNN is capable to compute deep features with amen representation of Melanoma, and hence improves the segmentation performance. The RCNN can detect features for multiple skin diseases of the same patient as well as various diseases of different patients with efficient training mechanism.

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Magnetic Resonance (MR)-only prostate radiotherapy has recently been clinically implemented using commercial synthetic Computed Tomography (sCT) algorithms. However patients with hip prostheses have been excluded from all MR-only research to date and assumed to require dedicated sCT algorithms. This study aimed to investigate the dosimetric accuracy of applying a commercial sCT algorithm, based on an atlas of patients without hip prostheses, to patients with prostheses. Materials and methods: 18 patients with unilateral hip prostheses received MR and CT scans in the radiotherapy position. sCTs were generated from the MR using a commercial algorithm. The clinical Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) plan, consisting of partial arcs which avoided the prosthesis, was recalculated using the sCT and the dose distribution compared. Results: The mean isocentre dose difference was ΔD = (−0.4 ± 0.2)% (mean ± standard error of the mean (sem), range – 1.9%, 1.1%) and the mean differences in Planning Target Volume, bladder and rectum mean doses were ≤0.3%. The 3D global gamma pass rate with dose difference 1% and distance to agreement 1 mm within the body was Γ Body 1/1 = (95.0 ± 0.5)% (sem) and within the 50% isodose volume, which excluded the prosthesis, was Γ 50% 1/1 = (98.5 ± 0.4)% (sem). The pass rate within the PTV was Γ PTV 2/2 ≥ 99.7% for all patients, although for PTVs close (≤3.5 cm) to the prosthesis Γ PTV 1/1 &lt; 85% for three patients. The sCT did not accurately represent the prosthesis with a mean difference in radiological isocentre depth near the prosthesis of Δd Outside Rad = (15.8 ± 2.6) mm (sem). However inside the treatment plan arc the difference was Δd Inside Rad = (−1.8 ± 0.5) mm (sem). Conclusions: Using a commercial prostate sCT algorithm for patients with unilateral hip prostheses is dosimetrically accurate (&lt;0.5%) as long as the routine prosthesis-avoidance treatment planning approach is used and the PTV is &gt;3.5 cm from the prosthesis. This suggests MR-only prostate radiotherapy can be extended to patients with hip prostheses without requiring a specific sCT algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly obtained to define congenital lung lesions (CLL) for surgical management. Postnatal, preoperative computed tomography (CT) provides further clarity at the cost of radiation. Depending on the lesion identified, the indication for resection remains controversial. We investigated the differences in detail found on prenatal MRI and postnatal CT compared with final pathology to determine their utility in preoperative decision-making. Materials and methods: All children undergoing resection of CLLs at a single institution between July 2009 and February 2018 were retrospectively identified. Their imaging, operative, and pathology reports were compared. All imaging studies were examined by pediatric radiologists with experience in prenatal CLL diagnosis. Results: Fifty-five patients underwent CLL resection during the study period with 31 undergoing prenatal MRI, 45 postnatal CT, and 22 both. Resection was performed before 6 mo of age in 62% of patients. In the cohort undergoing both imaging studies, pathologic CLL diagnosis correlated with prenatal MRI and CT in 82% and 100% of patients, respectively (P = 0.13). Eight patients had systemic feeding vessels, of which 38% were identified on MRI, and 88% on CT (P = 0.13). Both studies had a specificity of 100% for detecting systemic feeding vessels. Conclusions: For children where prenatal MRI detected a systemic feeding vessel, CT was redundant for preoperative planning but had greater sensitivity. Ultimately, the CLL type predicted from postnatal CT was not significantly different from that predicted by prenatal MRI; however, both imaging modalities had some level of discrepancy with pathology. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Epidemiologic studies suggest an increased risk of leukemia among individuals occupationally exposed to some organochlorine (OC) compounds. Associations between serum OC pesticide and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common subtype of acute leukemia in adult populations, have not been evaluated prospectively in the general population. Objective: We evaluated the risk of AML in relation to pre-diagnostic serum levels of OC pesticides and PCBs in a case-control study nested within the Janus Serum Bank Cohort. Methods: Janus is a large population-based cohort containing biologic samples collected beginning in the early 1970s from ~318,000 individuals in Norway. Serum levels of 11 OC pesticides or their metabolites and 34 PCB congeners were measured in 56 AML cases and 288 controls. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to evaluate associations between lipid-adjusted serum OC levels and risk of AML. Results: Higher serum levels of total chlordane/heptachlor metabolites were associated with AML risk (3rd vs. 1st tertile odds ratio (OR) = 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91–5.63; p trend = 0.11). Significant exposure-response associations were observed for levels of heptachlor epoxide (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.05–7.73; p trend = 0.02) and dieldrin (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.07–6.83; p trend = 0.03). No significant exposure-response associations with AML risk were observed for total DDT or individual isomers and derivatives. Higher serum levels of p,p′-DDT showed a non-significant increase in risk, but the exposure-response became attenuated when co-adjusting for heptachlor epoxide or dieldrin levels. Serum PCB levels were not significantly associated with AML risk. Conclusions: Our data suggest that higher serum levels of dieldrin and metabolites derived from chlordane/heptachlor are associated with risk of AML in the general Norwegian population, based on samples collected on average ~17 years before diagnosis. Further research in populations with historically high or recent exposure to DDT is warranted to assess the association with AML risk with body burden of specific DDT isomers and derivatives. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, the mechanism of orobanone analogues formation via aromatization rearrangement of curcumol was minutely explored. Aromatization of curcumol with acetone under acidic condition was selected as the model reaction. The formation of a stable aromatic system was the driving force for this reaction. Based on the model reaction, other four new orobanone analogues were prepared through curcumol reacting with different carbonyl compounds. The results showed that the stability of carbocation, which was generated from the carbonyl compounds, and the steric hindrance were main factors affecting the aromatization. We also synthesized the analogue of aromaticane B using compound 2. In vitro anti-proliferative activity of some derivatives were tested by MTT assay. Two derivatives showed weak anti-tumor effect on two cancer cell lines (HepG2 and MCF7) under normoxia. Four orobanone analogue 2, 5, 6 and 9 significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1 luciferase reporter activity in HeLa cells with the IC 50 values of 13.6, 6.6, 2.4 and 18.2 μM, respectively. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides are generally believed to be the most pharmacologically active components of Panax ginseng. These compounds induce apoptotic cell death in various cancer cells, which suggests that they have anti-cancer activity. Anti-angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic approach for controlling angiogenesis-related diseases such as malignant tumors, age-related macular degeneration, and atherosclerosis. Studies showed that 20(S)-PPD at low concentrations induces endothelial cell growth, but in our present study, we found 20(S)-PPD at high concentrations inhibited cell growth and mediated apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The mechanism by which high concentrations of 20(S)-PPD mediate endothelial cell apoptosis remains elusive. The present current study investigated how 20(S)-PPD induces apoptosis in HUVECs for the first time. We found that caspase-9 and its downstream caspase, caspase-3, were cleaved into their active forms after 20(S)-PPD treatment. Treatment with 20(S)-PPD decreased the level of Bcl-2 expression but did not change the level of Bax expression. 20(S)-PPD induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in HUVECs and stimulated UPR signaling, initiated by protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activation. Total protein expression and ATF4 nuclear import were increased, and CEBP-homologous protein (CHOP) expression increased after treatment with 20(S)-PPD. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PERK or ATF4 inhibited the induction of CHOP expression and 20(s)-PPD-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our findings show that 20(S)-PPD inhibits HUVEC growth by inducing apoptosis and that ATF4 expression activated by the PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway is essential for this process. These findings suggest that high concentrations of 20(S)-PPD could be used to treat angiogenesis-related diseases. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To compare the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of changes in tissue vascularization as result of sorafenib treatment in a rat model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Male Buffalo rats with orthotopic liver tumors treated daily with 7.5 mg/kg sorafenib via oral gavage for 2 weeks (n = 9) were subject to DCE-MRI and CEUS 2 weeks after tumor implantation - right before treatment initiation - and also after treatment completion - right before tumor harvest. Untreated animals (n = 10) were used as control. Tumor tissue sections were stained for hematoxylin-eosin, pimonidazole, and CD34 for quantitative assessment of necrosis, hypoxia, and microvessel density (MVD), respectively. Results: Of all the DCE-MRI parameters that were evaluated, only volume transfer constant (K trans ) measurements were significantly lower in sorafenib-treated tumors (0.18 vs 0.33 min −1 , p &lt; 0.01), indicating a substantial decrease in vascular permeability caused by the therapy. This reduction was associated with decreased MVD (3.9 vs 10.8% CD34+ cells, p &lt; 0.01), higher tumor necrosis (31.9 vs 21.8%, p &lt; 0.001) and hypoxia (19.7 vs 10.5% pimonidazole binding, p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, statistical analysis demonstrate significant correlation of DCE-MRI K trans with histopathologic tissue necrosis (r = −0.537, p &lt; 0.05) and MVD (r = 0.599, p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, none of the CEUS measurements were significantly different between the control and treatment groups, and did not show statistical correlation with any of the histopathological parameters assessed (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Sorafenib-induced reduction in vascular permeability in this preclinical model of HCC is detected more accurately through DCE-MRI than CEUS, and DCE-MRI parameters strongly correlate with histopathological changes in tissue vascularization and tissue necrosis. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning-based method for segmentation of bones in CT scans and test its accuracy compared to manual delineation, as a first step in the creation of an automated PET/CT-based method for quantifying skeletal tumour burden. Methods: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to segment 49 bones using manual segmentations from 100 CT scans. After training, the CNN-based segmentation method was tested on 46 patients with prostate cancer, who had undergone 18 F-choline-PET/CT and 18 F-NaF PET/CT less than three weeks apart. Bone volumes were calculated from the segmentations. The network's performance was compared with manual segmentations of five bones made by an experienced physician. Accuracy of the spatial overlap between automated CNN-based and manual segmentations of these five bones was assessed using the Sørensen-Dice index (SDI). Reproducibility was evaluated applying the Bland-Altman method. Results: The median (SD) volumes of the five selected bones were by CNN and manual segmentation: Th7 41 (3.8) and 36 (5.1), L3 76 (13) and 75 (9.2), sacrum 284 (40) and 283 (26), 7th rib 33 (3.9) and 31 (4.8), sternum 80 (11) and 72 (9.2), respectively. Median SDIs were 0.86 (Th7), 0.85 (L3), 0.88 (sacrum), 0.84 (7th rib) and 0.83 (sternum). The intraobserver volume difference was less with CNN-based than manual approach: Th7 2% and 14%, L3 7% and 8%, sacrum 1% and 3%, 7th rib 1% and 6%, sternum 3% and 5%, respectively. The average volume difference measured as ratio volume difference/mean volume between the two CNN-based segmentations was 5–6% for the vertebral column and ribs and ≤3% for other bones. Conclusion: The new deep learning-based method for automated segmentation of bones in CT scans provided highly accurate bone volumes in a fast and automated way and, thus, appears to be a valuable first step in the development of a clinical useful processing procedure providing reliable skeletal segmentation as a key part of quantification of skeletal metastases. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Exploration of novel types of iron oxide nanoparticles as well as novel versatile ways to prepare them in a controlled manner keeping in mind necessity of narrow size distributions and high colloidal and chemical stability is an important task for modern nanochemistry. Most of the procedures for preparation of nanocrystalline iron oxides require drastic conditions and complex mixtures of reagents, therefore there is a high demand for methods of synthesis of such nanoparticles (NPs) in mild conditions. In this study, we discovered a new way to prepare crystalline goethite-like hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) NPs by fast and simple precipitation procedure in aqueous media and probed modification strategies aimed at the development of modified HFO nanoparticles for biomedical applications, including express-diagnostics and specific cell targeting. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a malignant childhood cancer arising from the embryonic sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest. Retinoic acid (RA) is included in the multimodal therapy of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma to eliminate minimal residual disease. However, the formation of RA-resistant cells substantially lowers 5-year overall survival rates. To examine mechanisms that lead to treatment failure, we chose human SH-SY5Y cells, which are known to tolerate incubation with RA by activating the survival kinases Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Characterization of downstream pathways showed that both kinases increased the phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute homolog 2 (Mdm2) and thereby enhanced p53 degradation. When p53 signaling was sustained by blocking complex formation with Mdm2 or enhancing c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, cell viability was significantly reduced. In addition, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the cell-cycle regulator p21 stimulated complex formation with caspase-3, which also contributed to cell protection. Thus, treatment with RA augmented survival signaling and attenuated basal apoptotic pathways in SH-SY5Y cells, which increased cell viability. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Apigenin and protoapigenone that both have the activities against various cancer cell lines co-exist in Macrothelypteris torresiana, while the extracts of M. torresiana couldn't achieve the fine anti-tumor effects for the existence of potent anti-tumor compounds. This study disclosed an antagonism between the two compounds on the protein level to elucidate the paradox. First, the study established the fingerprint for M. torresiana extract. The following anti-proliferation assay verified that the antagonism occurs between protoapigenone and apigenin. And then Western blot and qt-PCR were applied to evaluate the expression and transcription level of the Akt phosphorylation related targets to validate the antagonism at the protein level. Moreover, CETSA further validated the binding of PDK-1 with apigenin and protoapigenone, as well as the antagonism between the two compounds. Finally, the compound-protein complexes predicted by SYBYL-X gave the visual results for the antagonism. The results demonstrated that: Due to the structural similarity and close binding coefficients to the identical targets, when the cells were treated with apigenin and protoapigenone simultaneously, the Akt phosphorylation inhibition induced by protoapigenone would attenuate significantly. The antagonism disclosed in this paper could be a new explanation for the unsatisfied efficacy of M. torresiana extract. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Searching for the carrier systems for drug controlled release under weakly acidic condition related to tumor environment has attracted a tremendous level of attention. In this study, amphiphilic carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) was employed to fabricate nanoparticles (NPs) with an efficient and simple method by adjusting the pH values of CMC aqueous solutions. The prepared NPs could not only capture the doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) efficiently and alleviate the initial burst release, but also exhibit pH sensitivity under weakly acidic microenvironment for tumor therapy. Importantly, rectorite (REC) with lamellar structure could be intercalated with CMC chains to construct more compact structure and DOX could be captured in the interlayer of REC, which could contribute to heightening the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of DOX, as well as reducing the initial burst release and prolonging the therapeutic time. The NPs displayed the behavior of controlled DOX release at pH 4.5, which suggested that the intelligent colloids might be utilized in tumor therapy. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Lipophilicity must be necessarily determined in drug discovery since this physicochemical property will directly influence the pharmacokinetics of a drug as its pharmacodynamics profile. Pyridoclax is an original lead, recently identified as very promising in treatment of chemoresistant cancers. The partition coefficient (Kp) of this anticancer drug was determined by microplate assays, well adapted in drug discovery, since being rapid, and requiring only poor drug amounts. The analytical approach was performed either by UV derivative spectrophotometry after validation thanks to a set of basic, neutral and acid reference substances, or originally, by raw fluorescence spectrophotometry by taking advantage of the pyridoclax intrinsic fluorescence. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were formulated from soybean-, egg-, or dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, characterized in terms of granulometric properties, ζ potential (determined by DLS), and of phospholipid content (quantified by 1 H NMR, also in presence of cholesterol). Whatever the detection method used, log Kp of pyridoclax were in the same magnitude order, and pyridoclax appeared as a lipophilic compound. It was also established that interactions between this lead and biomimetic membranes were influenced by the relative fluidity of the membranes, as confirmed by results of a liposome leakage assay. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a life-threatening renal infection characterized by the formation of gas within the renal parenchyma and collecting duct system, as well as perinephric tissues. We herein report a case of bilateral EPN accompanied by the urinary tract infection caused by spherical growth of Candida albicans in a patient with underlying diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer. The diagnosis was assisted by computed tomography, urography, and gram staining. Despite immediate percutaneous catheter drainage and a 4-week course of antifungal treatment, the C. albicans infection was refractory, as indicated by continuous isolation from the urine, and the patient eventually died. A local autopsy of urinary organs revealed C. albicans in the renal tissue. EPN caused by Candida species frequently occurs in men, and almost all cases have underlying poorly controlled diabetes. This condition is subject to delayed diagnosis, which may lead to extended disease and high mortality. Candida species should be considered as causative microorganism for refractory EPN in patients with poorly controlled diabetes who are receiving antibiotic treatment. Gram staining may contribute to an early diagnosis of EPN caused by Candida species, which may require long-term antifungal therapy. © 2018 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Granulomatous lobular mastitis (GLM) is a rare inflammatory disease of the breast that clinically mimics breast cancer. However, its etiology is not completely defined. The purpose of this study was to systematically study the bacteriology of GLM using advanced detection technology. Methods: Paraffin-embedded tissue from patients with GLM was collected. DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, and the data were processed using bioinformatics analyses. Results: A total of 40 patients were recruited into the study. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that a total of 17 genera or 19 species of pathogens were present in 39 of the GLM patients (97.5%). These included bacteria, fungi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group. Bacteria were found in 39 of the patient cases, while fungi were present in five. Only one case tested positive for M. tuberculosis complex. In addition, a single genus of pathogen was found in nine patients (23.1%), whereas 30 patients (76.9%) tested positive for multiple pathogens. Conclusions: This study profiled the microbiota of patients with GLM using NGS technology, which provides more useful information for establishing patient treatment plans. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Many diseases including cancer, Parkinson's disease and heart diseases are caused by loss or malfunction of regulatory mechanism of an oscillatory system. Successful treatment of these diseases might involve recovering the healthy behavior of the oscillators in the system, i.e., achieving synchrony or a desired distribution of the oscillators on their periodic orbit. In this letter, we consider the problem of controlling the distribution of a population of cellular oscillators described in terms of phase models. Different practical limitations on the observability and controllability of cellular states naturally lead to an ensemble control formulation in which a population-level feedback law for achieving a desired distribution is sought. A systems theoretic approach to this problem leads to Lyapunov- and LaSalle-like arguments, from which we develop our main contribution, novel necessary and sufficient conditions for the controllability of phase distributions in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the phase response curve. Since our treatment is based on a rather universal formulation of phase models, the results and methods proposed in this letter are readily applicable to the control of a wide range of other types of oscillating populations, such as circadian clocks, and spiking neurons. © 2017 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is reported to be a promising technique to eradicate various cancers. As most of the photosensitizers (PSs) are hydrophobic in nature, thus, the effective delivery of PSs at the targeted site is the main hurdle associated with PDT. Zinc phthalocyanine and Zinc naphthalocyanine are reported as good PSs, however, highly hydrophobic characteristics restrict their use for clinical applications. To circumvent this limitation here we developed the advanced polymer-based nano-delivery system having polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated polymeric core with ~90% PS encapsulation. The PEG coating was responsible for the stabilization of probe in the physiological environment and storage conditions. The developed theranostic probes showed efficient in vitro fluorescence and singlet oxygen quantum yields upon irradiation with 620–750 nm (30 mW/cm 2 ) light. The clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) based mechanism of cellular internalization was evaluated. The fluorescence of treated MCF-7 cells showed the ability of the probes as imaging agents. Moreover, up to 65% cell inhibition showed their cytotoxic efficiency. Further, comparatively higher tumor-accumulation of PSs without significant hepato/nephro-toxicity shown in vivo experimentation using breast tumor-bearing female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats suggested the featured passive targeting ability of preparations and clinically safe to be used. The study explored the exceptional delivery system for hydrophobic PSs with commendable theranostic applications. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Ion binding to biomacromolecules can modulate their activity and stability in vivo. It is of particular interest to understand the structural and energetic basis of anion binding to functional sites of biomacromolecules. In this work, binding of anions to the FAD binding pocket of human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a flavoprotein associated with cancer due to a common polymorphism causing a P187S amino acid substitution, was investigated. It is known that NQO1 stability in vivo is strongly modulated by binding of its flavin cofactor. Herein, binding and protein stability analyses were carried out to show that anion binding to the apo-state of NQO1 P187S inhibits FAD binding with increasing strength following the chaotropic behavior of anions. These inhibitory effects were significant for some anions even at low millimolar concentrations. Additional pH dependent analyses suggested that protonation of histidine residues in the FAD binding pocket was not critical for anion or flavin binding. Overall, this detailed biophysical analysis helps to understanding how anions modulate NQO1 functionality in vitro, thus allowing hypothesize that NQO1 stability in vivo could be modulated by differential anion binding and subsequent inhibition of FAD binding. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Sendai virus strain Tianjin, a novel genotype of Sendai virus, has been proven to possess potent antitumor effect on certain cancer cell types although inactivated by ultraviolet (UV). This study was carried out to investigate the in vitro anticancer properties of UV-inactivated Sendai virus strain Tianjin (UV-Tianjin) on human osteosarcoma cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. Our studies demonstrated UV-Tianjin significantly inhibited the viability of human osteosarcoma cell lines and triggered apoptosis through activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in MG-63 cells. Meanwhile, autophagy occurred in UV-Tianjin-treated cells. Blockade of autophagy with 3-methyladenine remarkably attenuated the inhibition of cell proliferation by UV-Tianjin, suggesting that UV-Tianjin-induced autophagy may be contributing to cell death. Furthermore, UV-Tianjin induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which was involved in the execution of MG-63 cell apoptosis and autophagy, as evidenced by the result that treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, attenuated both apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, inhibition of apoptosis promoted autophagy, whereas suppression of autophagy attenuated apoptosis. Our results suggest that UV-Tianjin triggers apoptosis and autophagic cell death via generation of the ROS in MG-63 cells, which might provide important insights into the effectiveness of novel strategies for osteosarcoma therapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The effects of dietary supplementation with Antarctic krill oil (AKO) on longitudinal bone growth in adolescent male Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) mice for 21 days were investigated. Histological results showed that AKO promoted longitudinal bone growth, increased skeletal mineral content and strength, enhanced entochondrostosis supported by higher longitudinal bone growth rate and growth plate height. Then, the potential mechanisms responsible for these observations were measured, results showed that AKO increased the secretion of the GH-IGF-1 pathway and entochondrostosis-related factors in serum increased the expression of IGF-1 in the liver and bone, which promoted proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes, vascular invasion and bone formation related gene expression. AKO promoted longitudinal bone growth, using the GH-IGF-1 pathway, suggesting that AKO might be a potential functional food to improve growth potential of adolescents. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel methodology based on quantum signal processing (QSP) and cellular automata (CA) to detect microcalcifications in mammograms. The methodology includes algorithms to detect microcalcification in binary and grayscale images. Essentially, quantum algorithms are used to improve edge detection results and CA are used to enhance the definition of the microcalcification in both groups of images. In grayscale images, CA are used to identify areas having a high probability of being microcalcifications. Benchmark images from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (Mini-MIAS) digital mammogram database and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), which include mammograms showing several abnormalities previously evaluated by experts, were used in our study. Experiments using the two quantum processing algorithms were conducted, and the results were compared with those of other approaches for microcalcification detection. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of Digitalis grandiflora Miller (Plantaginaceae) led to the isolation of an undescribed cardenolide type glycoside digigrandifloroside (1) along with five known compounds, rengyoside A (2), rengyoside B (3), cleroindicin A (4), salidroside (5), and cornoside (6), from its aqueous fraction of methanolic extract. Structures of the isolated compounds were determined by means of spectroscopic techniques. 1–6 were isolated for the first time from D. grandiflora. 2 and 3 are being reported for the first time from Digitalis genus and Plantaginaceae family with this study. This is the second report for occurrence of 4 from a Digitalis species. Cytotoxic activity of the aqueous fraction was also tested against HEp-2 (Human larynx epidermoid carcinoma) and HepG2 (Human hepatocellular carcinoma) cancer cell lines and L929 (Mouse fibroblast cell) non-cancerous cell line. Aqueous fraction showed stronger cytotoxicity on HEp-2 cells than HepG2. Therefore, the cytotoxic activity of 1, 2, 4, and 6 were tested against HEp-2 and L929 cell lines. 3 and 5 couldn't be tested due to their insufficient amount. 1 showed the highest cytotoxicity against HEp-2 cells with IC 50 value 10.1 μM when compared with the positive control, etoposide and 2–6 (IC 50 of etoposide; 39.5 μM). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the study is to the effective approach for the development of methotrexate (MTX) loaded as an anticancer drug into Cu-based metal-organic framework nanohybrid (Cu-MOF/MTX) inserted in pH-sensitive gelatin microsphere biopolymer (Cu-MOF/MTX@GM). MTX was loaded into two-dimensional tunnels and the empty face-centered cubic lattice of Cu-MOF porous. The developed Cu-MOF/MTX@GM was characterized using FTIR, SEM, and XRD analysis. In vitro drug release was demonstrated through the comparison of the simulated physiological conditions and tumor tissue environment for illustrating the MTX release ability of the obtained novel microspheres. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of the MTX-loaded Cu-MOF @GM is examined by MTT assay using the human breast epithelial adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines, and the results revealed that the carrier was suitable as an anticancer drug targeting. According to the obtained results, the developed carrier has promising qualities as an excellent candidate for target delivery of MTX to cancer tissues. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "The potential risk of arsenic-related neurodegeneration has been a growing concern. Arsenic exposure has been reported to disrupt neurite growth and neuron body integrity in vitro; however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previously, we showed that arsenic sulfide (AS) exerted cytotoxicity in gastric and colon cancer cells through regulating nuclear factor of the activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. The NFAT pathway regulates axon path finding and neural development. Using neural crest cell line PC12 cells as a model, here we show that AS caused mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, reactive oxygen species production, and cytochrome c release, leading to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis via the AKT/GSK-3β/NFAT pathway. Increased glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) activation leads to the inactivation of NFAT and its antiapoptotic effects. Through inhibiting GSK-3β activity, both nerve growth factor (NGF) and Tideglusib, a GSK-3β inhibitor partially rescued the PC12 cells from the AS-induced cytotoxicity and restored the expression of NFATc3. In addition, overexpression of NFATc3 stimulated neurite outgrowth and potentiated the effect of NGF on promoting the neurite outgrowth. Collectively, our results show that NFATc3 serves as the downstream target of NGF and plays a key role in preventing AS-induced neurotoxicity through regulating the AKT/GSK-3β/NFAT pathway in PC12 cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Silibinin is a flavonolignan extracted from milk thistle, which has been used for treating liver disorders, various cancers, and gynecological diseases. However, attempts for treating endometriosis with silibinin are lacking. In this study, we observed that silibinin exerts antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on human endometriotic cell lines VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7. We also identified that silibinin-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in human endometriotic cells. Moreover, we observed upregulation of calcium concentration in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix, which resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress signals with rapid mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling resulted in apoptosis of both cells. Using an animal model mimicking the retrograde menstruation hypothesis, we verified the effects of silibinin on reducing endometriotic lesions by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines in mice. Silibinin might be used as a novel therapeutic agent or supplement for inhibiting progression of endometriosis in vitro and in vivo. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Telomerase is essential for the maintenance of telomeres, structures located at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes that are crucial for genomic stability. Telomerase has been frequently explored in mammals because of its activity in many types of cancers, but knowledge in plants is rather sketchy despite plants representing useful models due to peculiarities in their telomeres and telomerase biology. We studied in planta complementation of telomerase in Arabidopsis thaliana mutant plants with disrupted expression of the gene encoding the telomerase protein subunit (AtTERT) and significantly shortened telomeres. We found that the upstream region of AtTERT, previously identified as a putative minimal promoter, was essential for reconstitution of telomerase function, as demonstrated by the full or partial recovery of the telomere phenotype in mutants. In contrast, transformation by the full length AtTERT gene construct resulted in more progressive telomere shortening in mutants and even in wild type plants, despite the high level of AtTERT transcript and telomerase activity detected by in vitro assay. Thus, the telomerase protein subunit putative promoter is essential for in planta telomerase reconstitution and restoration of its catalytical activity. Contributions from other factors, including those tissue-specific, for proper telomerase function are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The cytotoxicity (SMMC-7721) of PFOA was measured. The amount-effect relationship of the PFOA toxicity was elucidated at the cellular and molecular level. © 2019 Elsevier LtdTo better understand the toxicological activities of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), we examined the effects of PFOA on apoptosis and its molecular mechanism in SMMC-7721 hepatoma cells. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR were used to examine the protein and gene expressions of Bax and Bcl-2. Our results showed that PFOA inhibited SMMC-7721 cell growth and induced apoptosis. PFOA treatment increased Bax expression and increased Bcl-2 expression at both gene and protein levels. Our study demonstrated that PFOA had toxic effects on SMMC-7721 cells, such as inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in various biological processes, including migration, proliferation, differentiation, cell cycling, and apoptosis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to be related to the capability of migration and invasion in many tumor cells. In this study, we used wound-healing assay and transwell invasion to analysis the capability of migration and invasion in non–small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), respectively. The expression of ubiquitin-specific protease-9-X-linked (USP9X) and miR-212 messenger RNA (mRNA) was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis was used to determine the E-cadherin and vimentin expression. Our results showed that miR-212 mimic inhibited cell migration and invasion, while miR-212 inhibitor increased cell migration and invasion. There was no significant difference between WP1130 and miR-212 mimic combined with WP1130 groups. Moreover, WP1130 inhibited the capability of the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Western blot analysis displayed that miR-212 mimic upregulated E-cadherin expression and downregulated vimentin expression, while miR-212 inhibitor downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin expression. These data showed that miR-212 regulated NSCLC cell invasion and migration by regulating USP9X expression. Taken together, these findings indicated that miR-212 regulated NSCLC cells migration and invasion through targeting USP9X involved in EMT. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8-like 3 (TIPE3) is closely related to tumourigenesis and development. However, its role in human glioblastoma (GBM) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that TIPE3 is upregulated in GBM, and its high expression predicts poor prognosis. TIPE3 depletion induces GBM cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism studies reveal that TIPE3 inhibits p38 phosphorylation and negatively regulates the p38 MAPK pathway. TIPE3 associates with p38. The nuclear translocation of p38 is blocked by TIPE3 overexpression. And p38 phosphorylation could regulate TIPE3-mediated p38 nuclear-cytopalsmic translocation but does not affect TIPE3-p38 association. Rescue experiments confirm that TIPE3 inhibits GBM cell apoptosis via the p38 MAPK pathway. In conclusion, TIPE3 inhibits p38 phosphorylation and blocks p38 nuclear translocation. This action thus negatively regulates the p38 MAPK pathway and results in GBM cell survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Methylation-derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (mdNLR) has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker of outcomes in various cancers. We evaluated the prognostic value of blood-derived mdNLR within a retrospective cohort of pediatric medulloblastoma patients. Materials and methods: DNA methylation was measured in archival peripheral blood samples collected on 56 pediatric medulloblastoma patients. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between mdNLR and survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Compared to patients who were alive at last follow-up (n = 43), the mean mdNLR value was slightly higher in deceased patients (n = 13) (12.3 vs. 5.2,P = 0.163). Elevated log-transformed mdNLR was suggestively associated with an increased likelihood of death in unadjusted models (HR=1.43, 95%CI: 0.92–2.22) and significantly associated with mortality in adjusted models (HR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.01–2.58). Discussion: Future work is warranted to investigate the relationship between mdNLR outcomes in specific pediatric medulloblastoma molecular subgroups. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "To get new anti-hepatoma agents with anti-inflammatory activity and hypotoxicity, a series of dissymmetric pyridyl-substituted 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones (BAPs, 25–82) were designed and synthesized. Many of them exhibited potential anti-hepatoma properties against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2, QGY-7703, SMMC-7721) and hypotoxicity for human normal heptical cell line (HHL-5, LO2), and prominently inhibited lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced IL-6, TNF-α secretion to exert its anti-inflammatory effect. Combining the data of cytotoxicity, cytocompatibility and anti-inflammatory activity, 3-pyridyl and -CF 3 substituted 67 may be the potential anti-hepatoma agent. 67 effectively promoted cell apoptosis through up-regulating cleaved caspase-3 and Bax expression and down-regulating Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, 67 prominently inhibited NF-κB pathway activation by blocking the phosphorylation of IκBα p65 and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB induced by TNF-α and LPS. In addition, 67 could reasonably bind to the active site of Bcl-2 and NF-κB/p65 protein proved by Molecular docking analyses. Moreover, 67 significantly suppressed the growth and inflammatory response of HepG2 xenografts in nude mice and was relatively nontoxic to mice. These results suggest that 67 may be effective and hypotoxicity anti-hepatoma agent for the clinical treatment of liver cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Osteoclasts are multinuclear giant cells responsible for bone resorption in bone loss diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, and the aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants. Because of injurious side effects with currently available drugs, it is necessary to continue research novel bone-protective therapies. Daidzin, a naturally occurring isoflavone found in leguminous plants, has numerous beneficial pharmacologic effects, including anti-cancer, anti-cholesterol, and anti-angiocardiopathy, promoting osteoblasts differentiation, and even anti-osteoporosis. However, the effect of daidzin on the regulation of osteoclast activity has not yet been investigated. In this study, our study showed that daidzin significantly inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages and the hydroxyapatite-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts by inhibiting RANKL-induced NF-kB signaling pathway. In addition, daidzin could inhibit the expression of osteoclast marker genes, including nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), cellular oncogene fos (c-Fos), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and cathepsin K (CTSK). Consistent with in vitro results, daidzin inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced bone loss by suppressing the osteoclast differentiation. Together our data demonstrated that daidzin inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through suppressing NF-ĸB signaling pathway and that daidzin is a promising agent in the treatment of osteolytic diseases. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of death from cancer in the world. To comprehensively investigate the utility of microRNAs (miRNAs) and protein-encoding transcripts (messenger RNAs [mRNAs]) in HCC as potential biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis, we exhaustively mined genomic data from three available omics datasets (GEO, Oncomine, and TCGA), analyzed the overlaps among gene expression studies from 920 hepatocellular carcinoma samples and 508 healthy (or adjacent normal) liver tissue samples available from six laboratories, and identified 178 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with HCC. Paired with miRNA and lncRNA data, we identified 23 core genes that were targeted by nine differentially expressed miRNAs and 21 HCC-specific lncRNAs. We further demonstrated that alterations in these 23 genes were quite frequent, with five genes altered in over 5% of the population. Patients with high levels of YWHAZ, ENAH, and HMGN4 tended to have high-grade tumors and shorter overall survival, suggesting that these genes could be promising candidate biomarkers for disease and poor prognosis in patients Swith HCC. Our comprehensive mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA omics analyses from multiple independent datasets identified robust molecules that may be used as biomarkers for early HCC detection and diagnosis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Commercial marine organisms were collected from the coast of Xiangshan Bay to investigate the concentrations of eight heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and evaluate the potential health risks. The results indicated considerable variations in the heavy metal concentrations among six species groups, of them mollusks (seasnail, benthic bivalve, and oyster) generally contained relative high levels of most metals, followed by crustaceans (crab and shrimp), by contrast, fish had low concentrations of all metals, except Hg. Three heavy metal groups were identified to interpret the accumulative characteristics in the marine organisms. Spatial distributions illustrated the geographical variations of heavy metal concentrations in the sampling areas. Moreover, maricultured organisms demonstrated lower heavy metal concentrations than did the wild. Health risks of most heavy metals exposed from marine organism consumption were safe, except for As which is associated with the high target cancer risk values. © 2019",

    "Funding Text 1": "Heavy metal Mollusk Crustacean Fish Health risk Xiangshan Bay The coastal environment of China has been heavily contaminated by the terrestrial pollutants which released from land-based sources through rivers and land runoff with the rapid urbanization and industrialization over the last few decades ( Pan and Wang, 2012 ; M. Wang et al., 2018 ). Heavy metals represent a major category of these pollutants of great concern for marine organisms and the consumers because of their potential toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation ( Raknuzzaman et al., 2016 ; La Colla et al., 2018 ). State Oceanic Administration (SOA) of China reported that the total amount of Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Hg, and As influx from the Yangtze River to the East China Sea in 2017 was estimated to be 13,160 tons, which was considerably higher than that from other rivers in China ( SOA, 2018 ). Therefore, more attention should be focused on heavy metal pollution in the coastal environment of East China Sea ( Huang et al., 2007 ). Heavy metals in water, suspended particulate matter, and sediment of the coastal environment can be taken up and accumulated by marine organisms ( Jordao et al., 2002 ). The heavy metal concentrations in the tissues of different marine organism species heavily varied not only from their physiological and metabolizable processes, but also from their living environment ( Sunlu, 2006 ; Raknuzzaman et al., 2016 ; Baki et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). Therefore, some marine organisms are excellent indicators for long-term monitoring of heavy metal contamination levels in various marine environments ( Baki et al., 2018 ). For example, bivalve mollusks, particularly oyster, mussels, and clams, have been used to monitor heavy metal pollution in marine water and sediment of coastal areas ( Zhou et al., 2008 ; J. Liu et al., 2017 ). Crabs, a typical benthic organism, can be considered as an excellent indicator for measuring heavy metal contamination in the surface sediment ( Ololade et al., 2011 ). Fish can be used as excellent biomonitor to estimate heavy metal levels in water ( Zhou et al., 2008 ). Heavy metal accumulation in the marine organisms can cause severe damage and toxic effects to animals, which may further lead to high ecological risk ( Raknuzzaman et al., 2016 ; Gu et al., 2017 ). In addition, heavy metals in the tissues of marine organisms may transfer to humans through seafood consumption, which is increasing rapidly due to the beneficial nutrition ( Guérin et al., 2011 ). Marine mollusks, crustaceans, and fish usually contain essential amino acids for humans, and they are crucial sources of minerals, vitamins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Fuentes et al., 2009 ). Therefore, increasing seafood consumption can result in potential health risks for humans, particularly the coastal residents who rely on seafood as their primary source of animal protein ( Chien et al., 2002 ; Raknuzzaman et al., 2016 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). The Xiangshan Bay, one of the most important semi-enclosed mariculture bases, is located on the coast of the East China Sea, with a length of 60 km, width of approximately 10 km at the mouth, shallow depth of <10 m at the bay head, and deep depth of 20–30 m in the middle segment ( Sun et al., 2014 ; Yang et al., 2018 ). Its water is sourced mainly from the coastal waters, including the Changjiang Diluted Water, which is the large amount of fresh water discharged from Yangtze River (also known as Changjiang River) spreading over the East China Sea continental shelf as low salinity water ( Matsuno et al., 2006 ; Zhu et al., 2017 ; Yang et al., 2018 ). More than 50,000 tons of mollusks, shrimp, crabs, and fish are produced for consumption in Xiangshan Bay every year ( Huang et al., 2008 ). However, the levels of heavy metals in the environment of the bay are influenced by anthropogenic inputs, with high enrichment of some metals in the sediment because of wastewater discharge and low energy hydrodynamic environment ( Sun et al., 2014 ). Therefore, heavy metal concentrations in the marine organisms collected from Xiangshan Bay can not only indicate heavy metal contamination, but also aid in evaluating the potential health risk of seafood consumption. In the present study, we determined the concentrations of eight heavy metals namely As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the commercial species of mollusks, crustaceans, and fish collected from the coast of Xiangshan Bay to achieve the following objectives: 1) investigate concentrations of heavy metals in marine organisms collected from the Xiangshan Bay and compare the variations among different species, 2) examine the geographic variation of heavy metals levels in the Xiangshan Bay used by the bioindicators of marine organisms, 3) compare the heavy metal concentrations between maricultured and wild organisms, and 4) evaluate the potential health risk of heavy metals for local residents by calculating the daily intake and target hazard quotient (THQ) resulting from seafood consumption. Three commercial mollusk groups, namely seasnail, including spotted babylon ( ) in April 2016. The approximate average body length for each species were 3, 2, 3, 5, 2.5, 2, 2.5, and 4 cm and weight were 10, 5, 10, 18, 8, 6, 8, and 12 g, respectively. Crustaceans comprised crab, including intertidal ocypodid crab ( Babylonia areolata ), Korean mud snail ( Bullacta exarata ), and dog whelk ( Thais clavigera ), benthic bivalve including razor clam ( Sinonovacula constricta ), short necked clam ( Ruditapes philippinarum ), subcrenated ark ( Scapharca subcrenata ), and blood clam ( Tegillarca granosa ), and giant Pacific oyster ( Ostrea cucullata ) were collected from sampling sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 15, and 16 in the coastal areas of Xiangshan Bay ( Fig. 1 Macrophthalmus japonicus ), fiddler crab ( Ocypoda stimpsoni ), swimming crab ( Portunus trituberculatus ), and mangrove crab ( Scylla serrata ), and shrimp, including whiteleg shrimp ( Penaeus vannamei ), Chinese white shrimp ( Fenneropenaeus chinensis ), and mantis shrimp ( Oratosquilla oratoria ), were collected from sampling sites 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 14 ( Fig. 1 ) in April 2016. The approximate average body length for each species were 4, 4, 8, 6, 12, 10, and 10 cm and weight were 20, 25, 100, 80, 30, 20, and 18 g, respectively. Samples of consumed fish, including bigmouth grenadier anchovy ( Coilia macrognathos ), soles ( Cynoglossus abbreviatus ), long-finned herring ( Ilisha elongata ), large yellow croaker ( Larimichthys crocea ), flathead gray mullet ( Mugil cephalus ), Japanese sea perch ( Perca fluviatilis ), mudskipper ( Periophthalmus modestus ), and Japanese Spanish mackerel ( Scomberomorus niphonius ), were collected from sites 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16 ( Fig. 1 ) in April 2016, with the approximate average body length for each species of 20, 25, 20, 30, 25, 35, 8, and 20 cm and weight of 120, 300, 200, 400, 300, 500, 20, and 250 g, respectively. Mollusk samples were collected by local fishermen from the clearly defined coastal sites of Xiangshan Bay. Wild crustacean and fish samples were collected through bottom trawling of our research cruise, and the cultured samples were obtained from the farmers at mariculture zones. Immediately after collection, the living marine organism samples were washed with seawater, placed in pre-cleaned polyethylene bags and, thereafter, transported to the laboratory in an icebox. After transportation, the samples were rinsed with deionized water to remove surface adherents. The edible portions of the collected organism samples were dissected with clean stainless steel knives. Tissues of 15 individuals for each mollusk and crustacean species and five individuals for each fish species collected from the same sampling site or same mariculture zone were homogenized as a single mixed sample in a blender. The mixed wet samples were frozen at −20 °C immediately after accurately weighing and then freeze-dried with a vacuum freeze dryer (Christ Delta 1-24LS, Germany). The dried tissue samples were weighed to calculate the ratio of moisture content for use in health risk assessment and then ground into powder by using an agate mortar. The powder samples were stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Approximately 0.2 ± 0.005 g freeze-dried samples of marine organism tissues were weighed into Teflon digestion vessels and digested using 10 mL HNO 3 (ultra pure, Merck, Germany) in a microwave system (CEM Mars 6, USA) with the previously described conditions ( Liu et al., 2015 ). After digestion, the solution was diluted to 25 mL with ultra pure water (18.2 MΩ cm −2 Milli-Q water, Millipore) for heavy metal analysis. The concentrations of seven metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, PerkinElmer, Elan DRC-e, USA). The Hg concentration was evaluated through atomic fluorescence spectrometry (Skyray Instrument, AFS200, China). The concentrations of studied heavy metals are expressed as μg/g dry weight (dw). The detection limits of the methodology calculated using triple standard deviation values of blanks and average dry weight of samples were As (0.005 μg/g), Cd (<0.001 μg/g), Cr (0.018 μg/g), Cu (0.025 μg/g), Ni (0.002 μg/g), Pb (0.005 μg/g), Zn (0.008 μg/g), and Hg (0.003 μg/g), respectively. Standard reference material (CRM shrimp, GBW10050) from the Center of National Standard Reference Material of China was used to verify accuracy of the analysis by using the same procedures as that for the samples. The recovery rates for standard reference materials were within 10% of the certified values. One-half value of the limit of detection was assigned in the case of undetected concentrations. The one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K S) test was used to assess the data normality. All the concentration values for eight heavy metals in the tissues of six marine species groups (seasnail, benthic bivalve, oyster, crab, shrimp, and fish) were normally distributed at the 95% confidence level. Therefore, the variations of heavy metal concentrations in the six groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the significance was determined at p  < 0.05. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to explore the associations among heavy metals in the tissues of marine organisms. All statistical analyses in this study were performed using the statistical package SPSS 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corp., USA). The concentrations of eight heavy metals in mollusks (seasnail, benthic bivalve, and oyster), crustaceans (crab and shrimp), and fish collected from 16 sampling sites in Xiangshan Bay were compared based on the statistical analysis of one-way ANOVA ( ). Overall, according to the results, the concentrations of all selected heavy metals except for As ( Fig. 2 F 5, 36  = 2.436, p  = 0.053) varied significantly among the six groups of different marine species ( F 5, 36  ≥ 3.524, p  ≤ 0.011). The ranking order of the mean concentration for eight metals in all the marine organisms from Xiangshan Bay (n = 42) was Zn > Cu > As > Cr > Cd > Ni > Pb > Hg, with a trend similar to that in the previous studies ( Raknuzzaman et al., 2016 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). This result indicated the variation in the accumulation of different heavy metals in marine organism tissues. Marine organisms can readily assimilate and considerably accumulate the freely dissolved and transported heavy metals in seawater ( Jordao et al., 2002 ). The variation in heavy metal concentrations among different marine species was mainly because of several factors, such as the feeding strategies, metabolic abilities, physiological activities, living habits, migration, and heavy metal affinity for specific organs of marine organisms ( J. Liu et al., 2017 ; Baki et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). In general, in this study, mollusks including seasnail, benthic bivalve, and oyster contained relative high levels of most metals, including Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn, especially Cd, Cu, Ni, and Pb ( Fig. 2 ). The highest concentrations of Cd (13.27 μg/g dw), Cu (719.48 μg/g dw), Hg (0.16 μg/g dw), Ni (3.66 μg/g dw), Pb (1.79 μg/g dw), and Zn (1976.86 μg/g dw) for six groups of marine organisms were discovered in oyster tissues, of which Cd and Cu exhibited significant variations ( p  < 0.05). Oysters accumulate high concentrations of heavy metals through filter feeding from surrounding seawater with extremely high metal accumulation factors for Cu and Zn. The related studies that attempted to address how oysters tolerate such high Cu and Zn levels in their tissues indicated that: 1) compartmentalization of toxic metals in the membrane-limited vesicles of hemocytes played an important detoxificatory role for the oysters ( Weng and Wang, 2015 ) and 2) oysters may efficiently detoxify the excessive Cu and Zn by storing them in oxygen- and nitrogen-bonded complexes ( Tan et al., 2015 ). Moreover, previous studies demonstrated that Cu or Zn accumulation in oysters facilitated other toxic metals absorption, such as Cd and Hg ( Liu and Wang, 2013, 2014 ). Such metal interactions may partly explain the high concentrations of Cd, Hg, Ni, and Pb in the oysters. Furthermore, seasnail exhibited high levels of all heavy metals, with the highest concentration of As (35.62 μg/g dw) in the soft tissue among the six groups and highest concentration of Cr (7.62 μg/g dw) in the mollusk species ( Fig. 2 ). Seasnail is a predatory carnivorous or omnivorous species and mainly feeds on bivalves and other marine organisms ( Liu et al., 2018 ; Zhelyazkov et al., 2018 ). Aquatic biota may accumulate heavy metals through trophic transfer. Therefore, because of these special food chains, the heavy metal concentraitons in seasnails were generally higher than bivalves as described in previous studies ( Topcuoglu et al., 2002 ; Zhelyazkov et al., 2018 ). In addition, this mollusk species has often been used as an environmental pollution biomonitor because it contains high metal levels in their soft tissues ( Mulayim and Balkıs, 2015 ; Zhelyazkov et al., 2018 ). Compared with other two mollusk groups, benthic bivalve contained the lowest levels of the eight metals, but the concentrations of Cd (0.45 μg/g dw), Ni (1.23 μg/g dw), and Pb (0.58 μg/g dw) in benthic bivalve tissues were slightly higher than those in crustaceans and fish ( Fig. 2 ). In contrast with oyster, which is a sessile species living on the surface of reefs or rocks and mainly feeds on suspended materials, benthic bivalves generally inhabit sediments and primarily feed on organic detritus, benthic diatoms, and zoobenthos ( J. Liu et al., 2017 ). Benthic bivalves typically tend to accumulate more heavy metals than do sessile species because of the high enrichment of heavy metals in sediments ( L.Q. Zhao et al., 2012 ). However, their metal concentrations were comparatively low in this study because of the special heavy metal accumulation mechanism in oysters and food chain enrichment in seasnails, which agreed with reported reviews ( Wang and Lu, 2017 ). As examined in previous studies, benthic bivalves ( e.g. , clams) displayed a relatively high dietary assimilation and elimination, which indicated that the fast efflux of heavy metals might be a crucial mechanism for the metal regulation in benthic bivalves; thus maintaining a low heavy metal concentration in the tissue when compared with oysters and seasnails ( Pan and Wang, 2009 ). Crustaceans ( e.g. , crab and shrimp) are typical benthic organisms. Thus, they could heavily accumulate some essential and toxic trace metals by their particular physiological, biochemical strategies, and living habits ( Baki et al., 2018 ). The hepatopancreas of crab and other crustaceans accumulate high amounts of heavy metals and played a crucial role in metal detoxification ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Reinecke et al., 2003 ). Moreover, crab and shrimp are mobile benthic species and reside above the sediment, which results in more heavy metal accumulation from the sediment ( S. Zhao et al., 2012 ). In this study, the concentrations of As detected in the crab and shrimp samples (28.42 and 33.48 μg/g dw, respectively) were considerably higher than that in the benthic bivalve, oyster, and fish samples ( Fig. 2 ). The Cr concentration (8.26 μg/g dw) in shrimp was much higher than benthic bivalves, oyster, crabs, and fish, but was comparable with that in seasnails ( Fig. 2 ). Among the species of crustacean, high concentration of Cr was observed in shrimp. However, toxic Hg concentration in crab samples (0.13 μg/g dw) was considerably higher than that in shrimp. Moreover, the Zn concentration in the crab (215.34 μg/g dw) was comparatively higher than that in shrimp (61.84 μg/g dw), and other metal concentrations did not exhibit obvious difference between the crustacean species. These results indicated that the close taxa species in the same genus accumulated different concentrations of several metals as described in previous studies ( Baki et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). In addition, crustaceans were considered excellent biomarkers for measuring heavy metal contamination in surface sediments ( Baki et al., 2018 ). Based on the results of this study, heavy metal concentrations in fish muscles exhibited considerably lower concentrations than that of other marine organism groups, except for Hg. The mean concentration of Hg in fish muscle was 0.10 μg/g dw, which was comparable with that in seasnail, oyster, and crab, but considerably higher than that in bivalves and shrimp ( ). A review study indicated that muscle MeHg concentrations as low as 0.2–0.5 μg/g ww in teleost fish might influence the biochemical processes and reduce reproductions ( Fig. 2 ). Fish mainly assimilate metals from surrounding seawater through three ways including ingestion from suspended particulate materials, ion exchange across lipophilic membranes during breathing, and food chain delivery from their diet ( Yi et al., 2011 ). Thus, fish can be used as bioindicators of metal contamination in aquatic environment ( Gu et al., 2017 ) and the assimilation mechanisms result in lower levels of metal concentration than that in mollusk and crustacean ( Liu et al., 2018 ). However, it has been established that fish usually accumulate more Hg with concentrations of >0.5 μg/g dw in the fish from other coastal areas, which was mainly due to their high trophic levels ( García-Hernández et al., 2018 ). The average concentration of Hg in fish muscle tissues was 0.023 μg/g wet weight (ww) with a range from 0.004 to 0.083 μg/g ww ( Tables 1 and 2 Depew et al., 2012 ). Moreover, the maximum permissible level for Hg recommended by the World Health Organization and The National Health and Family Planning of People's Republic of China (NFHPC) is 0.5 μg/g ww ( WHO, 1990 ; NFHPC, 2017 ). WHO recommends a lower guideline of 0.2 μg/g ww for Hg to protect vulnerable people, including pregnant women, children under 15 years old, and those who consume fish frequently ( WHO, 1990 ). The concentrations of Hg in the fish muscles in this study were considerably lower than the risk or maximum permissible level. However, most of the Hg (>80%) in the muscle tissues of various fish species was methylmercury (MeHg), the most toxic and bioaccumulative form of Hg in marine ecosystems ( Matulik et al., 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Table 1 compares heavy metal concentrations expressed on the basis of wet weight in seasnail, benthic bivalve, oyster, crab, shrimp, and fish of this study with the reported concentrations in marine organisms collected from other areas. In general, most heavy metal concentrations in marine organisms collected from Xiangshan Bay were comparable to those from other areas. The Cu concentrations in the benthic bivalve and oyster in this study were slightly higher than those in others, but Cd and Cu concentrations in the fish were much lower than those in others areas. Moreover, Ni and Pb concentrations in the marine organisms were lower than the concentrations in other areas. The As and Zn concentrations in the marine organisms varied heavily depending on different species and study areas. The concentrations of different heavy metals in the marine organisms varied heavily because of many complex factors, such as environmental parameters ( ). Before PCA, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's test of sphericity were used to examine the validity of PCA, with provided results of 0.661 and 293.5 (df = 28, e.g. , pH, temperature, salinity, content of cation exchange capacity, and heavy metal concentrations in seawater or sediment), physiological factors ( e.g. , tissues, organs, and feeding conditions for organisms), and physicochemical properties and biological activities or toxicities of metal ions ( Sunlu, 2006 ; Chen et al., 2015 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). In this study, PCA was used to visually exhibit the associations among the analyzed metals in all the marine organisms. The result is presented as the rotated component loading plot ( Fig. 3 p  < 0.01), respectively. This indicated that PCA was useful in dimensionality reduction ( Gu et al., 2012 ). The first three principal components of the PCA explained 80.64% of the total variance in this study. The first principal component, which accounted for 38.20% of the total variance, was mainly dominated by Cu, Zn, Cd, and Hg with the loading of 91.1%, 92.4%, 89.7%, and 63.6%, respectively. The second component explained 24.0% of the total variance and was dominated by Ni and Pb with the loading of 84.3% and 85.0%, respectively. The third component that was dominated by Cr (87.9%) and As (82.9%) explained 18.45% of the total variance. According to the PCA methodology, the relationships between the three components were relatively independent. However, metal relationships were close within each component. Therefore, three independent heavy metal groups were identified in this study, which indicated different accumulative characteristics among the metal groups in the marine organisms tissues. However, similar accumulative characteristics occurred within the metal groups ( Liu et al., 2018 ). The geographical variation in heavy metal concentrations in marine organisms was commonly related to the local pollution status ( , respectively, to illustrate their geographical variation or contamination in Xiangshan Bay. J. Liu et al., 2017 ). As indicated in reported studies, mollusks ( e.g. , seasnail and bivalve), crustaceans, and fish can be used as bioindicators for heavy metal pollution in different environmental mediums, because these categories accumulate relatively high metal content in their tissues ( Mulayim and Balkıs, 2015 ; Gu et al., 2017 ; Baki et al., 2018 ; Zhelyazkov et al., 2018 ). In this study, the concentrations of each studied metal in the mollusks, crustaceans, and fish in terms of spatial distributions at different sampling sites are presented in Figs. 4, 5, and 6 Some differences were observed among the sampling sites with regards to heavy metal concentrations in mollusks ( Fig. 4 ). To enable the distribution comparable, seasnail, benthic bivalve, and oyster species are separated in the map. The distributions of As, Cd, and Zn concentrations in the seasnails were noticeably high at the sites 12 and 16. A high concentration of Pb was observed at site 2. Concentrations of other metals were not obvious difference in seasnails. Overall, the differences in spatial distributions of heavy metals in benthic bivalves and oyster were not highly clear. Relative high concentration of Cr was observed in the benthic bivalves at site 5, Hg was observed at sites 5 and 15, Ni was observed at sites 4 and 12, and Pb was observed at site 6. High concentrations of Cu and Zn were observed in the oyster at sites 2 and 15. The spatial distributions of heavy metals in the crustaceans are presented in Fig. 5 . At site 4, As and Cd concentrations in the crabs were highest in this study. High Cr concentrations in the crabs were observed at sites 4, 6, and 14. High concentrations of Cu were observed at sites 6 and 8. High Hg concentrations in the crabs were observed at sites 8 and 9. High Ni and Pb concentrations were observed at site 8. The lowest concentration of Zn was observed at site 4, and no obvious differences of heavy metal concentrations in the crabs were observed at other sites. For the studied metals in the shrimps, high levels of As and Pb were observed in Chinese white shrimp ( F. chinensis ) tissues collected from site 4. The Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, and Zn concentrations in the shrimp at site 10 displayed similar patterns and higher concentrations in mantis shrimp ( O. oratoria ) than that in four whiteleg shrimp ( P. vannamei ) samples. However, the Cr concentration was low in the mantis shrimp at site 10. These results occurred possibly due to the variation in shrimp species and their feeding habits ( Baki et al., 2018 ). Mantis shrimp ( O. oratoria ) is carnivorous and eats benthic crabs, snails, and shellfish using powerful punches. Therefore, the high concentrations of several heavy metals in their tissues possibly resulted from accumulation through trophic transfer. The spatial distributions of heavy metals in the fish are illustrated in Fig. 6 . The concentrations of As in the fish muscles were relatively high at site 16. The highest level of Cd was observed at site 6, and low Cd concentrations were observed at sites 5, 7, and 10. High difference was observed in the distributions of Cr levels in the fish, with high levels at sites 7, 10, 14, and 16, which was mainly because of the benthic living habits of C. abbreviatus , C. macrognathos , and P. modestus . According to the results, Cu and Zn concentrations in the fish did not demonstrate obvious difference. High Hg levels were observed at sites 13 and 6. Highest Ni and Pb levels were observed at site 14. Concentrations of Ni at site 7 and Pb at site 16 were relatively high as presented in the maps. In general, most sampling sites had high concentrations of some selected heavy metals in marine organisms. For tidal flats and sediments indicated by mollusks, high metal level sites were 2, 5, 12, 15, and 16. As indicated by results from the crustaceans, the heavy metal concentrations in the bottom environment were relatively high at sampling sites 4, 6, 8, and 10. The heavy metal concentrations were high in the upper seawater at sites 6, 7, 13, 14, and 16, which was indicated by the fish. In addition to marine environmental pollution, it should be considered that the physiological variations of marine organism species and their living habits result in high levels of heavy metals in organisms. Xiangshan Bay is an important mariculture base located on the coast of the East China Sea, with a large production of raft cultured oyster, cage cultured fish, and beach cultured shellfish ( ). For the heavy metal concentrations in fish, concentrations of almost all of the selected metals including Zn, As, Cu, Hg, Cd, Ni, and Pb were low in the farmed and high in the wild fish ( ). Those findings concurred with previous studies that have proposed growth dilution to explain this phenomenon ( Sun et al., 2014 ). In the present study, we fortunately collected both wild and maricultured samples of oyster ( O. cucullata ) and fish ( M. cephalus ) in Xiangshan Bay. Therefore, heavy metal levels in maricultured and wild organisms were compared in this study. The comparison results indicated that the concentrations of Zn and Cu in the wild oysters were higher than that in raft cultured oysters, and the difference in levels of other metals were not considerably high ( Fig. 7 Fig. 8 Qiu, 2015 ). Growth dilution consists of decrease in pollutant concentrations in organism when the organism grows rapidly. Therefore, growth dilution may regulate heavy metal bioaccumulation in cultured oyster and fish because they generally grow very rapidly compared with the wild. Moreover, the concentrations of many metals in the organism tissues could biomagnify along the food chains, with higher metal levels in organisms on the longer food chains ( Qiu, 2015 ). Cage cultured fish mainly fed on artificial fish pellets and small trash fish and had a relatively short food chain. However, dietary structures for wild fish were highly complex. Thus, heavy metal concentrations were low in the farmed fish and high in wild fish. The food sources for cultured and wild oysters were similar, but wild oysters inhabited the reefs along the coastal areas that often retained relatively high concentrations of heavy metals ( Liu et al., 2018 ). This can be an important factor for the high concentrations of Cu and Zn in wild oyster. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) represented an estimate of the daily exposure doses of heavy metals for human population through their diets ( Baki et al., 2018 ). To calculate the EDIs, heavy metal concentrations expressed as wet weight in the tissues of six marine species groups were converted according to the moisture content of each sample. The EDIs were calculated using the following formula: EDIs = F × D × I × C W × T where F is the exposure frequency (365 days/year); D is the exposure duration (70 years); I is the ingestion rate of mollusk, crustacean, and fish which considered to be 17.1, 8.3, and 105 g/person/day, respectively, as used in previous studies ( Jiang et al., 2005 ; Guo et al., 2007 ); C is the concentration of heavy metals in the edible tissues expressed as wet weight converted from dry weight (μg/g ww); W is the average body weight (55.9 kg for adults) as used in previous studies ( Hang et al., 2009 ); and T is average time (365 days/year multiplied by the number of exposure years, assuming 70 years in this study). The EDIs of selected heavy metals from seasnail, benthic bivalve, oyster, crab, shrimp, and fish consumption by adults are summarized in Table 2 . The EDIs for most of the studied heavy metals in seasnails and oysters of mollusks were higher than that in crustaceans and fish except for As and Hg, which were highest in fish ( Table 2 ). Those results indicated that the coastal residents were exposed to high doses of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn from the consumption of mollusks and exposed to high doses of As and Hg from fish consumption. The results were considerably similar to that in our previous study except for Cr, of which the highest EDI was found in fish ( Liu et al., 2018 ). In addition, the permissible provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) values for all metals summarized by Mok et al. (2015) from the data of Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are listed in Table 2 as one of the reference points to assess the hazard risk from the marine organisms consumption. The potential health risks of heavy metals resulting from seafood consumption for coastal people were evaluated according to previously described methods ( Liu et al., 2018 ). As described by the US EPA standard methods, THQ represented the potential non-carcinogenic risk for heavy metals ingested through the oral intake and was expressed as the ratio of the daily oral intake and the oral reference dose (RfDo, US EPA, 2014 ; Q. Liu et al., 2017 ) with the following equations: THQ = EDIs RfDo The RfDo was used as a reference daily exposure dose, to which humans are continually exposed over a lifetime without a considerable risk of carcinogenic effects ( Raknuzzaman et al., 2016 ). In this study, RfDo of selected metals were obtained from the regional screening level summary table ( US EPA, 2014 ), with the exception of Pb ( Hang et al., 2009 ), to assess the EDIs metal risks in marine organisms. The THQ values for individual metals from different marine organism species consumption are presented in . According to the results, the THQ values for most of the studied metals in all of the marine organism species were less than one, with the exception of As. The THQ values for As in all species were more than one, with the highest value of 12.28 in fish. The estimated results of this study indicated potential non-carcinogenic health risk from ingestion of As through consumption of these marine organism species, especially fish. Continuous and excessive fish ingestion could result in chronic non-carcinogenic effects. Table 3 Carcinogenic risks estimated as the incremental probability of an individual to develop cancer over a lifetime exposure to potential carcinogens ( US EPA, 1989 ) were measured based on the target cancer risk (TR) and calculated as follows: TR = EDIs × CSFo × 10 − 3 where CSFo is the oral carcinogenic slope",

    "Abstract": "The transmembrane receptor NOTCH1 is thought to be associated with the development and progression of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)/T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The current study aimed to characterize NOTCH1 expression and elucidate the variants in the functional PEST domain of the receptor in T-ALL/LBL and CLL/SLL. The nuclear expression of NOTCH1 protein was detected in 25% and 5% of cases of T-ALL/LBL and CLL/SLL, respectively, whereas cytoplasmic expression was detected in 33.3% and 15% cases, respectively. The frequency of variants in T-ALL/LBL was 33%, whereas 40% of CLL/SLL cases possessed variants. Four novel variants were identified; three of which were non-synonymous and one common variant c.7280_7280delG between T-ALL/LBL and CLL/SLL cases. The previously described variant, c.7541_7542delCT, was detected in 3 cases of CLL/SLL. These results provide support for the contribution of NOTCH1 in the etiology of these types of cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Two new monofunctional mono-metallic trans-Pt(II)(salicylaldimine)(pyridine)·BF 4 (C1) and supramolecular dimetallic trans-(Pt(II)(salicylaldimine)) 2 (4,4-bipyridine)·2BF 4 (C2) complexes were designed and synthesized through ancillary chloride ligand exchange strategy and structurally characterized by spectroscopic, spectrophotometric and single crystal X-ray analyses. The solid-state structure analyses revealed interactions between the coordination planes, inter-molecular H-bonding, bonding in the ligand hydrogen and BF 4 anions and supramolecular interactions with solvent molecules in crystal packing. The in vitro anticancer effect of these complexes was investigated in breast (MCF-7) and liver (HepG2) cancer cells. Both these complexes showed significant anticancer effect comparable to cisplatin. Similarly, the effect of these complexes on Escherichia coli (E. coli) growth retardation was also analyzed and the results revealed stronger growth retardation effect and elongated morphology of bacterial cells in similar fashion as observed for cisplatin. The DNA interaction of C1 and C2 was investigated by gel electrophoresis using pET28 as target DNA. These complexes retarded migration of DNA across the gel showing their interaction with DNA. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Radiosusceptibility is the sensitivity of a biological organism to ionising radiation (IR)-induced carcinogenesis, an outcome of IR exposure relevant following low doses. The tissue response is strongly influenced by the DNA damage response (DDR) activated in stem and progenitor cells. We previously reported that in vivo exposure to 2 Gy X-rays activates apoptosis, proliferation arrest and premature differentiation in neural progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells and neuroblasts) but not in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the largest neurogenic region of the adult brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). These responses promote adult quiescent NSC (qNSC) activation after 2 Gy. In contrast, neonatal (P5) SVZ neural progenitors continue proliferating and do not activate qNSCs. Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible. Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50–500 mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500 mGy, respectively. Importantly, qNSCs were not activated at doses below 500 mGy. Thus, full DDR activation in the neural stem cell compartment in vivo necessitates a threshold dose, which can be considered of significance when evaluating IR-induced cancer risk and dose extrapolation. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs are classified as small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression mainly through targeting the 3′UTR region of mRNAs. A great number of miRNAs play important role in the regulation of signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells. Here, we predicted hsa-miR-5195-3p (miR-5195-3p) as a potential regulator of TGFβ signaling and investigated its effect on TGFB-R1, TGFB-R2, SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 transcripts which are key players of TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway. Overexpression of miR-5195 in HCT116 cells resulted in a significant reduction of TGFB-R1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 at the mRNA level which was confirmed using RT-qPCR. Consistently, western blot analysis confirmed that miR-5195 overexpression in HCT116 cells resulted in downregulation of TGFBR1 at the protein level. Furthermore, dual luciferase analysis verified the direct interaction of miR-5195 with TGFB-R1 and SMAD4 3′UTR sequences in SW480 cells. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that miR-5195 overexpression significantly increased the sub-G1 and decreased the G-1 cell populations in both SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. Finally, miR-5195 overexpression significantly downregulated c-MYC and cyclin D1 but upregulated p21 genes. Overall, our results indicated that miR-5195 modulates TGFβ signaling pathway and affects the cell cycle progression through targeting TGFB-R1, TGFB-R2, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 transcripts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Prostaglandin (PG)E 2 seems to promote tumor proliferation by regulating cell growth, inhibiting apoptosis, promoting angiogenesis, and suppressing host immune surveillance of cancer cells. The suppression of prostaglandins biosynthesis is thought to be the main molecular mechanism for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs antineoplastic effect. Yet the relationship between PGE 2 and human renal cell carcinoma remains unclear. The aim of our study is to evaluate the PGE 2 content in human renal parenchyma and Renal Cell Carcinoma. The study was conducted on 20 consecutive patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for Renal Cell Carcinoma. In the normal renal parenchyma and in the neoplastic renal tissue the PGE 2 level was 83.43 ± 5.89 pg/mg and 289.67 ± 22.2 pg/mg, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001). There was no relationship between PGE 2 content and Renal Cell Carcinoma dimension, Fuhrman grade, pathological-Tumor-Node and Metastasis (pTNM) stage and histological subtype. The PGE 2 over-content in neoplastic renal tissue suggests a role of PGE 2 in development and progression of renal carcinoma. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "For the first time, solubility of imatinib mesylate (as a paradigm for cancer chemotherapy) in SC-CO 2 was determined. Experiments were performed at operating temperatures and pressures of 308.2–338.2 K and 120–270 bar, respectively. Two different groups of methods including (1) three equations of state (EoSs), namely Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK), Pazuki et al. (PAZ), and Haghtalab et al. (HKM) with vdW2 mixing rule and (2) six density-based semi-empirical models were applied to correlate the solubility data of imatinib mesylate. The calculated results indicated the superiority of HKM EoS over other models. Then, a new, comprehensive empirical model with six adjustable parameters was proposed and compared with existing empirical models. The superiority of this model was confirmed by experimental solubility data of imatinib mesylate and 25 solubility datasets published in the literature. The proposed model could correlate the experimental solubility of imatinib mesylate with satisfactory accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, isolated from recombinant bacterial/insect/yeast cells, are extensively used for drug metabolism studies. However, they may not always portray how a developmental drug would behave in human cells with intact intracellular transport mechanisms. This study emphasizes the usefulness of human HEK293 kidney cells, grown in ‘suspension’ for expression of CYPs, in finding potent CYP1A1/CYP1B1 inhibitors, as possible anticancer agents. With live cell-based assays, quinazolinones 9i/9b were found to be selective CYP1A1/CYP1B1 inhibitors with IC 50 values of 30/21 nM, and &gt; 150-fold selectivity over CYP2/3 enzymes, whereas they were far less active using commercially-available CYP1A1/CYP1B1 microsomal enzymes (IC 50 , &gt;10/1.3–1.7 μM). Compound 9i prevented CYP1A1-mediated benzo[a]pyrene-toxicity in normal fibroblasts whereas 9b completely reversed cisplatin resistance in PC-3/prostate, COR-L23/lung, MIAPaCa-2/pancreatic and LS174T/colon cancer cells, underlining the human-cell-assays’ potential. Our results indicate that the most potent CYP1A1/CYP1B1 inhibitors would not have been identified if one had relied merely on microsomal enzymes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) possesses a number of exceptional pharmaceutical properties and applications as compared with other types of metallic nanoparticles. Currently, AgNPs was biosynthesized using an aqueous extract of Zea mays L. (corn flour) powder. Further, the effect of concentration of reagents, extract, temperature and time of synthesis was also studied along with the cytotoxicity and radical scavenging potential. UV–vis spectra of AgNPs gave a surface plasmon resonance at ~420 nm. The absorption peak became sharp with the increase in time. AgNPs with monodispersed and aggregated spherical shape was observed by SEM image followed by its confirmation via strong signal in silver region of EDX spectrum. The XRD spectra confirmed its crystallinity and face-centered cubic structure. FT-IR spectra reveal the presence of phytocompounds in the synthesis of AgNPs. Further, the AgNPs exhibited strong cytotoxicity potential against HepG2 cells and its viability declined with an increase in the concentration of AgNP with respect to the control cells. It also demonstrated reasonable radical scavenging potential in terms of DPPH and ABTS scavenging, and reducing power tests. Taken together, these results of the current investigation stated that AgNPs could be beneficial in biomedical applications particularly for treatment of cancer disease along with its applications in pharmaceutical industries for the formulation of new drugs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Multifunctional phototheranostic nanoparticles assembled from photosensitizer molecules have attracted considerable attention the field of tumor phototherapies. However, most self-assembled photosensitizer nanoparticles only exhibit photothermal therapy (PTT) activity, while their photodynamic therapy (PDT) activity is greatly restricted. Here, we first obtained nanostructured ZnPc assemblies with dual-modal PTT and PDT functions upon exposure to monochromatic 650 nm near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. The as-prepared ZnPc nanoparticles not only showed good stability, excellent biocompatibility, and absorption in the appropriate NIR region, but also exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency (as high as 31.3%) and remarkable PDT performance. The simple synthesis method and outstanding therapeutic effect from synergistic PTT and PDT make the as-obtained ZnPc nanoparticles an ideal phototheranostic agent for effective and safe cancer treatment in clinical research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Spectrins are a group of cytoskeletal proteins which participate in many important cellular functions. It has been suggested that loss of spectrin isoforms may be associated with tumorigenesis of lymphoma, leukemia, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We recently reported that βI spectrin expression was present in normal hepatocytes but lost in HCC cells, which suggested that spectrins may be helpful markers in diagnosis of HCC. In this study, using immunohistochemical staining, we further investigated the expression pattern of four spectrin isoforms (αII, βI-III) on different benign and malignant liver tumors including focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), hepatic adenoma (HA), HCC, and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). The results revealed that βI spectrin was moderately to strongly positive in FNH and HA tissues, but was only weakly positive or lost in HCC cases and was weakly positive in all CC cases. In addition, the βIII spectrin, majority of which was moderately positive in both FNH and HA tissues, was mostly lost in poorly differentiated HCC but remained at least moderately positive in most CC cases. These results suggest that spectrins βI and βIII may be used to differentiate well differentiated HCC from FNH or HA, and poorly differentiated HCC from CC, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Splenogonadal fusion is an extremely rare congenital anomaly in which there is fusion between the spleen and gonad or derivatives of the mesonephros. Due to its extreme rarity, surgeons and radiologists lack the awareness enough to diagnose and sometimes even suspect the diagnosis, and most of the cases are discovered incidentally during various inguinoscrotal procedures. Asymptomatic inguinoscrotal mass is the most common presentation in children, and cryptorchidism is the most common associated anomaly. We present a case of splenogonadal fusion in a two years old child who was referred to our institution principally with right sided undescended testis. A left sided scrotal mass was found during examination, and this finding prompted us to conduct a thorough clinical evaluation. Preoperative diagnosis was not possible in this case and testicular tumor was the provisional diagnosis. Testicular sparing approach with biopsy of the lesion and histopathological examination helped to confirm the diagnosis and salvage the testis. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "An abnormal level of bisulfite can induce toxicological effects associated with lung cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Therefore, it is of significance to develop an effective fluorescent probe to detect bisulfite in living cells. Herein, a novel fluorescent probe QPCT, based on a 1,4-addition mechanism, was constructed for the colorimetric and ratiometric detection of bisulfite. QPCT displayed high selectivity and anti-interference ability to bisulfite over other anions and biothiols. The probe renders a sensitive ratiometric response to bisulfite with a remarkable fluorescence blue shift from 590 to 537 nm and the fluorescence ratio was linear with bisulfite concentration over the range of 0–120 μM. More importantly, QPCT has been successfully applied to detect bisulfite in sugars and living A549 cells, which indicated that QPCT had a great capability for monitoring bisulfite in complex systems. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Octa-(4-tyrosylamido) phenyl substituted Zn(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPcTyr8) was synthesized and characterized as potential photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The new ZnPcTyr8 was evaluated in comparison to recently synthesized tetra-(4-tyrosylamido) phenyl substituted Zn(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPcTyr) and used as a standard unsubstituted Zn(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc). The photophysical properties of absorption and fluorescence, and photochemical properties of singlet oxygen generation and photostability as well as in vitro photocytotoxicity property were investigated. The irradiation from a light-emitting diode (LED 665 nm) with a dose of 50 J cm −2 and a fluence of 60 mW cm −2 was applied. The obtained results suggested improved photophysicochemical properties of singlet oxygen generation for tyrosine-conjugated Zn(II)-phthalocyanines. In addition the tyrosine substitution to ZnPc is liable for gentle photocytotoxicity which is in contrast to the harsh phototoxic effect determined for ZnPc on tumor and normal cell lines. Among both tyrosine substituted Zn(II) phthalocyanines, a novel ZnPcTyr8 has advantages of water solubility and proper values of the main photophysicochemical properties responsible for PDT efficacy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Neutrophils have always been considered as uncomplicated front-line troopers of the innate immune system equipped with limited proinflammatory duties. Yet recently, the role of the neutrophil has been undergoing a rejuvenation of sorts. Neutrophils are now considered complex cells capable of a significant array of specialized functions, and as an effector of the innate immune response, they are able to regulate many processes such as acute injury and repair, cancer, autoimmunity, and chronic inflammatory processes. Furthermore, evidence exists to indicate that neutrophils also contribute to adaptive immunity by aiding the development of specific adaptive immune responses or guiding the subsequent adaptive immune response. With this revived interest in neutrophils and their many novel functions, it is prudent to review what is currently known about neutrophils and, even more importantly, understand what information is lacking. We discuss the essential features of the neutrophil, from its origins, lifespan, subsets, margination and sequestration of the neutrophil to the death of the neutrophil. We highlight neutrophil recruitment to both infected and injured tissues and outline differences in recruitment of neutrophils between different tissues. Finally, we examine how neutrophils use different mechanisms to either bolster protective immune responses or negatively cause pathological outcomes at different locations.",

    "Abstract": "The role of protein phosphatase 2ACα (PP2ACα) in brain development is poorly understood. To understand the function of PP2ACα in neurogenesis, we inactivated Pp2acα gene in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice by Cre/LoxP system and generated the PP2ACα deficient mice (designated as the Pp2acα −/− mice). PP2ACα deletion results in DNA damage in neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs), which impairs memory formation and cortical neurogenesis. We first identify that PP2ACα can directly associate with Ataxia telangiectasia mutant kinase (ATM) and Ataxia telangiectasia/Rad3-related kinase (ATR) in neocortex and NPCs. Importantly, the P53 and hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) function complex, the newly found down-stream executor of the ATR/ATM cascade, will be translocated into nuclei and interact with homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) to respond to DNA damage. Notably, HICI plays a direct transcriptional regulatory role in HIPK2 gene expression. The interplay among P53, HIC1 and HIPK2 maintains DNA stability in neuroprogenitor cells. Taken together, our findings highlight a new role of PP2ACα in regulating early neurogenesis through maintaining DNA stability in neuroprogenitor cells. The P53/HIC/HIPK2 regulation loop, directly targeted by the ATR/ATM cascade, is involved in DNA repair in neuroprogenitor cells. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Phytochemical investigation of the leaves of Gymnosporia senegalensis (Lam.) Loes. led to the isolation and characterization of eighteen compounds: one new polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived monoglyceride, (2S)-1-O-(4′Z,7′Z,10′Z-octadecatrienoyl) glycerol (1); four galloylglucoside derivatives (2–5), including one new named (2R)-methyl [(6′-O-galloyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy]phenylacetate (2), eleven phenolics (6–16), and two sterols (17–18). The structures of the isolates were determined by means of spectroscopic and spectrometric data, as well as by comparison with literature data. Galloylglucosides, especially cyanogenic constituents (3, 4) are described here for the first time in the genus. Antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of isolated compounds were investigated. None of the tested compounds showed growth inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus NBRC 13276, Bacillus subtilis NBRC 3134 and Escherichia coli NBRC 3972 at 50 μM, while 1, 7, 9, 17, and 18 at 50 μM showed relatively weak to moderate decrease of viability against colon (DLD1), breast (MCF7) and gastric (MKN45) cancer cells. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic significance of the isolated compounds was discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Riboflavin (Rf) or vitamin B₂ is a known photosensitizer whose photophysical and photochemical properties are well established. Aminophylline (Am) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and is currently used as a bronchodilator. Although there are several reports of haemolytic and proteolytic interaction of photoilluminated riboflavin with aminophylline, the cytotoxicity of this system against malignant tissue is not well defined and fully unravelled. Here, we are evaluating anticancer activity of this system against B(a)P induced lung carcinoma in swiss albino mice. We observed marked increment in the level of cellular redox scavengers as well as oxidative stress markers. A significant DNA damage was observed using comet assay. Histopathological studies further confirmed induction of apoptosis in lung tissues of Am-Rf treated animals. Scanning electron microscopy revealed altered surface morphology of the malignant tissue, which characteristically improved in the treatment group. Since malignancy is characterised by compromised redox status, therefore, further increment in ROS due to the action of this system derives cellular system towards extensive macromolecular damage and consequent ROS mediated apoptosis. We anticipate the usage of this system in developing efficient photodynamic therapy against lung cancer that can be clinically realised. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 4 (IRAK-4) has an important role in immunity, inflammation, and malignancy. The significant role of IRAK-4 makes it an interesting target for the discovery and development of potent small molecule inhibitors. In the current study, multiple linear regression -based QSAR analyses coupled with structure-based pharmacophoric exploration was applied to reveal the structural and physiochemical properties required for IRAK-4 inhibition. Manually built pharmacophoric models were initially validated with receiver operating characteristic curve, and best-ranked models were subsequently integrated in QSAR analysis along with other physiochemical descriptors. The pharmacophore model, selected using the statistically optimum QSAR equation, was implied as a 3D-search filter to mine the National Cancer Institute database for novel IRAK-4 inhibitors. Whereas the associated QSAR model prioritized the bioactivities of captured hits for in vitro evaluation. Experimental validation identified several potent IRAK-4 inhibitors of novel structural scaffolds. The most potent captured hit exhibited an IC 50 value of 157 nM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare central nervous system tumor occurring mostly in children and young adults. Next-generation sequencing of 295 cancer-related genes was used to investigate the molecular profiles of 13 cases of PXA. We found that BRAF V600E (5/13; 38%), FANCA/D2/I/M (5/13; 38%), PRKDC (4/13; 31%), NF1 (3/13; 23%), and NOTCH2/3/4 (3/13; 23%) alterations were the most frequent somatic gene mutations. However, neither PTEN nor EGFR mutation, which is frequently present in glioblastoma, was detected. The KRAS mutation in PXA is reported for the first time in these tumors. Microsatellite stability was present in all cases. Because mutations of FANCA and BRAF and copy number variations of CDKN2A/B are more frequent in PXA than in glioblastoma, they might be used to distinguish the 2 tumors. The MAPK pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of PXA and may be an effective target for treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Melanoma develops from pigment-producing melanocytes in the epidermis, and is the most common type of skin cancer. Because of the lack of effective therapies, the median survival of patients developing metastatic melanoma is less the 1 year. In this paper, we studied the oncogenic role of miR-135b in melanoma cells. We compared the miR-135b levels in 20 melanoma tissues in reference to their corresponding nontumor regions. Next, we studied the impact of miR-135b or its inhibitor on cell proliferation, migration, or apoptosis in either primary melanocytes or the melanoma cell line, respectively. Finally, we validated large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) as the downstream target of miR-135b in a luciferase reporter assay, western blotting analysis, and knockdown study in primary melanocytes. MiR-135b expression was significantly upregulated in melanoma tissue. Overexpressing miR-135b in primary melanocytes promoted cell proliferation and migration. In contrast, inhibition of miR-135b expression suppressed the growth and metastasis of A-375 cells and enhanced cell apoptosis. LATS2 was confirmed as the target of miR-135b. Knockdown of LATS2 in melanocytes also promoted cell growth, but not cell invasion potential. Our findings showed miR-135b as a novel oncogene in melanoma tumorigenesis. The oncogenic mechanism may involve the downregulation of LATS2.",

    "Abstract": "Dose-dependent cardiotoxicity is the leading adverse reaction seen in cancer patients treated with doxorubicin. Currently, dexrazoxane is the only approved drug that can partially protect against this toxicity in patients, however, its administration is restricted to those patients receiving a high cumulative dose of anthracyclines. Investigations into the mechanisms of cardiotoxicity and efforts to improve cardioprotective strategies have been hindered by the limited availability of a phenotypically relevant in vitro adult human cardiac model system. Here, we adapted a readily reproducible, functional 3D human multi-cell type cardiac system to emulate patient responses seen with doxorubicin and dexrazoxane. We show that administration of two NRF2 gene inducers namely the semi-synthetic triterpenoid Bardoxolone methyl, and the isothiocyanate sulfurophane, result in cardioprotection against doxorubicin toxicity comparable to dexrazoxane as evidenced by an increase in cell viability and a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species. We further show a synergistic attenuation of cardiotoxicity when the NRF2 inducers and dexrazoxane are used in tandem. Taken together, our data indicate that the 3D spheroid is a suitable model to investigate drug induced cardiotoxicity and we reveal an essential role of the NRF2 pathway in cardioprotection providing a novel pharmacological mechanism and intervention route towards the alleviation of doxorubicin-induced toxicity. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "The natural radioactive gas radon is widely present in the built environment and at high concentrations is associated with enhanced risk of lung-cancer. This risk is significantly enhanced for habitual smokers. Although populations with higher degrees of social deprivation are frequently exposed to higher levels of many health-impacting pollutants, a recent study suggests that social deprivation in the UK is associated with lower radon concentrations. The analysis reported here, based on published data on social deprivation and domestic radon in urban and rural settings in the English East Midlands, identifies a weak association between increasing deprivation and lower radon areas. This is attributed to the evolution of the major urban centres on low-permeability, clay-rich alluvial soils of low radon potential. In addition, the predominance of high-rise dwellings in towns and cities will further reduce average exposure to radon in populations in those areas. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been found to be associated with the biological behaviors of human cancers. LINC00152 is reported as an oncogene in many kinds of malignancies. However, the functions and mechanisms of LINC00152 involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain elusive. Our results revealed that LINC00152 expression was up-regulated in ESCC, and correlated with advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis of ESCC patients. Functionally, LINC00152 knockdown suppressed proliferation, decreased colony forming ability, and induced apoptosis in ESCC cells. Mechanically, LINC00152 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to sponge miR-153-3p, thereby facilitating its downstream target FYN. Moreover, miR-153-3p-mediated tumor-suppressive effects were partly reversed following LINC00152 overexpression. Also, FYN knockdown displayed a similar anti-cancerous role in ESCC cells. Taken together, LINC00152 contributed to ESCC progression by down-regulating miR-153-3p and promoting FYN expression, uncovering a novel LINC00152/miR-153-3p/FYN regulatory pathway in ESCC. © 2019 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "5-demethylnobiletin (5DN) in aged citrus peel (chenpi) is a unique polymethoxyflavone that has been shown to exhibit superior anti-cancer effects, but its low water-solubility and poor oral bioavailability may limit its application as a potent nutraceutical. In this study, Se-enriched peanut protein nanoparticles-stabilized Pickering emulsions (PPEs) were used to encapsulate 5DN to enhance its bioaccessibility, cellular uptake and transport rate. The preparation of PPEs, and their digestion profiles in gastrointestinal tract, cell uptake and transport were investigated. Results showed that the bioaccessibility of 5DN was significantly higher within PPEs (18.3%) than in bulk oil (9.2%). Besides, PPEs-encapsulated 5DN has a greater apical-to-basolateral (AP-BL) transport rate (26.9 × 10 −6 cm s −1 ) than 5DN (21.7 × 10 −6 cm s −1 ). It was proved PPEs may promote the bioavailability of 5DN, and this type of delivery system may be useful for the application of 5DN and other crystalline nutraceuticals in functional foods and beverages. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Although photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are widely commended for tumor treatment recently, they still suffer severe challenges due to the non-specificity of photothermal agents (PTAs)/photosensitizers (PSs) and hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Here, an oxygen independent biomimetic nanoplatform based on carbon sphere dotted with cerium oxide and coated by cell membrane (MCSCe) was designed and synthesized with good biocompatibility, homologous targeting ability, and improved photophysical activity. Notably, MCSCe could realize accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in tumor cells and hyperthermia under single laser (808 nm) irradiation, which were simultaneously utilized by itself to produce more toxic hydroxyl radical ([rad]OH). Resultantly, the synergistic therapeutic effect against tumor cells was obtained under near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Abnormal proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) have been found to be important for the airway remodeling during the pathogenesis of asthma. Salidroside a bioactive glucoside that exerts antitumor activity via inhibiting the cell proliferation and migration of cancer cells. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of salidroside on the proliferation and migration of ASMCs. Our results showed that salidroside inhibited the proliferation and migration of ASMCs in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation. Salidroside markedly attenuated the PDGF-induced production of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in ASMCs. The levels of contractile phenotype markers including smooth muscle α-actin and calponin were reduced in response to PDGF stimulation, which was attenuated by salidroside pretreatment. Salidroside diminished the increase in the expression levels of type I collagen and fibronectin in PDGF-stimulated ASMCs. Furthermore, salidroside blocked the PDGF-induced activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway in ASMCs. The results suggested that salidroside functionally regulated the proliferation, migration, phenotype plasticity, and extracellular matrix deposition in PDGF-induced ASMCs and the NF-κB pathway might be implicated in the effects of salidroside on ASMCs induced by PDGF. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The synthesis and antiproliferative effect of a series of quinoline and thiazole containing coumarin analogs 12a-d and 13a-f respectively, on mice leukemic cells was performed. The chemical structures of newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The result indicates that, 7-methoxy-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxylic acid [4-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-thiazol-2-yl]-amide (13f) showed potent activity against EAC and DLA cells in MTT (15.3 μM), tryphan blue (15.6 μM) and LDH (14.2 μM) leak assay with 5-fluorouracil as a standard. Further, the anti-neoplastic effect of the compound 13f was verified against Ehrlich ascites tumour by BrdU incorporation, TUNEL, FACS and DNA fragmentation assays. Experimental data showed that compound 13f induces the apoptotic cell death by activating apoptotic factors such as caspase-8 &amp;-3, CAD, Cleaved PARP, γ-H2AX and by degrading genomic DNA of cancer cells and thereby decreasing the ascitic tumour development in mice. Besides, compound 13f was also subjected for docking studies to approve the in vitro and in vivo studies. The data revealed that the compound 13f has very good interaction with caspase 3 protein by binding with amino acid Arg 207 through hydrogen bond. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Human cathepsin L is a ubiquitously expressed endopeptidase and is known to play critical roles in a wide variety of cellular signaling events. Its overexpression has been implicated in numerous human diseases, including highly invasive forms of cancer. Inhibition of cathepsin L is therefore considered a viable therapeutic strategy. Unfortunately, several redundant and even opposing roles of cathepsin L have recently emerged. Selective cathepsin L probes are therefore needed to dissect its function in context-specific manner before significant resources are directed into drug discovery efforts. Herein, the development of a clickable and tagless activity-based probe of cathepsin L is reported. The probe is highly efficient, active-site directed and activity-dependent, selective, cell penetrable, and non-toxic to human cells. Using zebrafish model, we demonstrate that the probe can inhibit cathepsin L function in vivo during the hatching process. It is anticipated that the probe will be a highly effective tool in dissecting cathepsin L biology at the proteome levels in both normal physiology and human diseases, thereby facilitating drug-discovery efforts targeting cathepsin L. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Drug resistance remains a major cause of relapse and therapeutic failure in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been documented to act as an oncogene and is frequently highly expressed in human cancers including AML. However, the function and molecular mechanism of MALAT1 in regulating cytarabine (Ara-C) resistance of AML are largely unknown. The expressions of MALAT1 and miR-96 in AML patients and healthy controls were examined by qRT-PCR. CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay were performed to assess the proliferation and apoptosis of AML cells. The interaction between MALAT1 and miR-96 was investigated by luciferase reporter assay. We found that MALAT1 was upregulated while miR-96 was downregulated in AML patients compared with healthy controls. A negative correlation between MALAT1 and miR-96 expressions was observed in AML patients. Knockdown of MALAT1 inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, and enhanced Ara-C sensitivity of AML cells. Additionally, MALAT1 suppressed miR-96 expression by acting as a molecular sponge of miR-96 in AML cells. miR-96 downregulation abolished the effects of MALAT1 knockdown on the proliferation, apoptosis, Ara-C sensitivity in AML cells. In conclusion, MALAT1 knockdown inhibited proliferation, promoted apoptosis and enhanced Ara-C sensitivity in AML cells by upregulating miR-96, providing novel insights into the critical role of MALAT1 as a miRNA sponge in AML. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Radiomics is a medical imaging technique that aims at extracting a large amount of features from one or several modalities of medical images, in order to help diagnose and treat diseases like cancers. Many recent studies have shown that Radiomics features can offer a lot of useful information that physicians cannot extract from these images, and can be efficiently associated with other information like gene or protein data. However, most of the classification studies in Radiomics report the use of feature selection methods without identifying the underlying machine learning challenges. In this paper, we first show that the Radiomics classification problem should be viewed as a high dimensional, low sample size, multi-view learning problem. Then, we propose a dissimilarity-based method for merging the information from the different views, based on Random Forest classifiers. The proposed approach is compared to different state-of-the-art Radiomics and multi-view solutions, on different public multi-view datasets as well as on Radiomics datasets. In particular, our experiments show that the proposed approach works better than the state-of-the-art methods from the Radiomics, as well as from the multi-view learning literature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Detecting deep tumors inside living subject is still challenging for Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI). In this study, a high-sensitivity endoscopic CLI (ECLI) system was developed with a dual-mode deep cooling approach to improve the imaging sensitivity. System was characterized through a series of ex vivo studies. Furthermore, subcutaneous and orthotropic human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models were established for ECLI guided tumor resection in vivo. The results showed that the ECLI system had spatial resolution (62.5 μm) and imaging sensitivity (6.29 × 10 −2 kBq/μl 18 F-FDG). The in vivo experimental data from the HCC mouse models demonstrated that the system was effective to intraoperatively guide the surgery of deep tumors such as liver cancer. Overall, the developed system exhibits promising potential for the applications of tumor precise resection and novel nanoprobe based optical imaging. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Phytochemical investigation on the fermentation broth of the fungus Stereum hirsutum led to the isolation of ten steroids, including two previously unreported ones, namely steresterones A (1) and B (2). The semi-synthesis products 3a and 3b were prepared by reduction of the known compound 3 with NaBH 4 . Their structures and absolute configurations were established via 1D &amp; 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis, and TDDFT/ECD calculations as well as single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The structure of 3 which harbored a 5β-H was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis for the first time. All the compounds reported in this study were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against five human cancer cell lines. Bioassay results revealed that 3, 4, 6―9 displayed significant anti-proliferative effects with IC 50 values varying from 2.3 to 34.3 μM. The structure-activity relationships of 3, 3a, 3b were discussed. © 2019 Phytochemical Society of Europe",

    "Abstract": "Global market of herbs has been struggling with food adulteration issues. A number of assays have been developed to aid the detection of the tampered samples and ensure high quality of the marketed products. However, herbs are marketed not only for their culinary applications but also as remedies due to high levels of biologically active constituents. Nevertheless, there is no information in the literature about the influence of herbs adulteration on the biological activity of the final product. Current study aims at assessing the influence of oregano adulteration on its in-vitro estrogen-like activity. High responses in a mammalian reporter gene assay have been detected in pure and adulterated samples, translating to 21–7409 ng of 17β-estradiol equivalents per gram of oregano. The origin of those responses was assessed by combining fractionation and UHPLC-HRMS. Three flavones were proposed as the most active extract constituents i.e. luteolin-glucoside, luteolin- and apigenin-glucuronides all of which have been previously identified in other herbal extracts with estrogenic activity. This study underlines challenges of biological activity assessment in complex herbal extracts as well as the need for further assessment of such supplement administrations in the case of postmenopausal women and breast cancer patients undergoing hormone therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Diabetes mellitus together with the oxidative stress affects the process of spermatogenesis and leads to male infertility. Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) is a mushroom found unique in Taiwan and commonly used for the treatment of several types of cancers and inflammatory disorders. This study was aimed to investigate the anti-oxidative and the ameliorative effects of Antrodia cinnamomea ethanol extract (ACEE) on reproduction dysfunction in male diabetic rats. The diabetic condition was induced by administrating the combination of streptozotocin (STZ) (65 mg/kg) and nicotinamide (NA) (230 mg/kg). Three different doses of ACEE were tested (385, 770, 1540 mg/kg) for 5 weeks. The results indicated that the ACEE improved STZ-NA induced hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. In addition to this, ACEE reduced the degree of lipid peroxidation, recovered the abnormal structure of the seminiferous tubules, and improved sperm parameters. Moreover, the DNA damages and mitochondrial membrane potential were improved in sperm. Our study confirmed that the ACEE has anti-inflammatory and ameliorative effects to prevent diabetes-induced male reproductive dysfunction. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Stem cells or Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have now been identified in different type of tissues by using surface markers. Functional assays such as ALDEFLUOR and side population which are marker independent have been additional approaches. However, whether all these approaches identify the same population of cells remain uncertain. To address this issue we have used hematopoietic stem cells as a model. Peripheral blood stem cells enumerated by CD34 are used routinely in bone marrow transplantation which supports the recovery of bone marrow after ablative chemotherapy or radiation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were obtained from normal donor bone marrow (n = 5) and G-CSF stimulated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) (n = 5) from patients undergoing leukapheresis prior to bone marrow transplantation. The stem cells were identified by combining CD34 expression with functional assays (ALDEFLUOR and side population). The cell cycle profile was further determined by simultaneous labeling of these cells with Hoechst and Pyronin Y. The simultaneous analysis showed that both CD34+ and CD34- cells co-exist with ALDH1A1+ cells but side population did not segregate with CD34+ cells. Though stem cell populations identified by functional assays were different, the cell cycle analysis showed that both ALDH1A1+ and CD34+ cells were in the G1 phase of cell cycle rather than in the quiescent (G0) phase. © 2019",

    "Abstract": "Small circular DNAs of 1.8 and 2.4 kb were initially discovered in highly infectious Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and scrapie particles from mammalian brain and cultured cells. Surprisingly, these protected cytoplasmic \"SPHINX\" DNAs contained replication (REP) initiation sequences resembling those of Acinetobacter phage viruses. An antibody was generated against a REP peptide encoded by the SPHINX 1.8 open reading frame (ORF) that was not present in mammals. It bound to a 41kd “spx1” protein on Western blots. Cytologically, spx1 concentrated in spinal cord synapses and pancreatic islet, but not exocrine cells. We hypothesized that circular SPHINX DNAs are ancient symbiotic elements that can participate in functional differentiation and neurodegeneration. Cell and tissue-specific patterns of spx1 expression shown below implicate somatic cell-to-cell communication and differentiation functions that would favor conservation of SPHINX 1.8 in evolution. Remarkably, primary human oocytes and spermatogonia, but not mature sperm, displayed intense cytoplasmic spx1 signals that underscore the maternal inheritance of SPHINX 1.8. These findings should encourage investigations of unexplored networks of incorporated environmental infectious agents that can be key actors in progressive neurodegeneration, immunity, and cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Acrylamide is a chemical, often present in bread, legally classified as carcinogen, mutagen and reproductive toxicant. Since bread is consumed both world-wide and in Iran, determination of acrylamide in different types of breads is of high interest. In the present study, acrylamide was monitored in 56 Sangak and 30 industrial bread samples collected from Tehran and Shiraz, using LC-MS/MS (LOQ = 1 ng/g). In addition, the noncarcinogenic risk (target hazard quotient–THQ) and carcinogenic risk (incremental lifetime cancer risk–ILCR) due to ingestion of acrylamide through bread consumption in children and adults were assessed. Acrylamide was detected in more than 90% of the samples tested. The average daily intake of acrylamide in Iran based on exclusive consumption of Sangak bread, was estimated at 145 ng/kg bw/day. Based on the THQ for bread acrylamide in adults and children, the decreasing risk order was: Shiraz semi-industrial Sangak, Shiraz traditional Sangak, Tehran traditional Sangak, Tehran industrial bread. The ILCR of bread acrylamide calculated for adults and children was higher than the permissible lifetime carcinogenic risk value established by USEPA (1.00E-5). Results show that bread is a major source of acrylamide intake by people in Iran and all consumers regardless of age could be at elevated carcinogenic risk. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Siliceous materials based intelligent drug delivery systems (DDS) have attracted numerous attentions. Unfortunately, their intrinsic biologic inertia and non-degradability are critical issues need to be addressed because it hampers further clinical translation application. Herein, disulfide-bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (designed as mSiO 2 (s-s)) have been synthesized through nucleophilic substitution reaction, which have biodegradability in simulative tumor reducing conditions. Furthermore, folic acid (FA) decorated bull serum albumin (BSA) has been modified onto the surface of mSiO 2 (s-s) to improve tissue biocompatibility, prevent anticancer drugs leakage and endow effective targeting capacity. Therefore, the nanoparticles present good biodegradability, tissue biocompatibility, tumor cell targeting capacity and pH/glutathione (GSH) dual-responsive drug release capacity. This novel drug nanocarrier possesses biosafety and effective anti-cancer strategy, provides significant promising in future biomedical application. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: High resolution CT is the most commonly used radiological method for differentiating benign from malignant peripheral solid pulmonary masses, however, some of them are not easily diagnosed by morphology alone. Furthermore, due to the radiation dose, it is unsuitable for patients with disorders requiring repeated examinations over prolonged periods. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether a combination of diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and free-breathing radial 3D fat-suppressed T1-weighted gradient echo (radial volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination, radial VIBE) sequence can enable discrimination between benign from malignant peripheral solid pulmonary masses. Materials and methods: Both chest CT scan and MR imaging with radial VIBE and DWI were obtained from 47 patients; 30 males and 17 females (mean age 64 years old; age range 48–83 years old). Benign and malignant peripheral solid pulmonary masses were conclusively identified by pathology results. Two radiologists independently reviewed all the images and record radiological features including morphological signs on radial VIBE, CT images, and ADC value. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to analyze the capability of radial VIBE as well as DWI to distinguish malignant from benign peripheral solid pulmonary masses. Results: In 77% of patients, malignant peripheral solid pulmonary masses were found. Morphological signs of mediastinal lymph node enlargement and lobulation were more easily found in malignant masses in both radial VIBE (mediastinal lymph node enlargement: p = 0.033, lobulation: p = 0.039) and CT (mediastinal lymph node enlargement: p = 0.004, lobulation: p = 0.012). The ADC value were also significant difference between benign and malignant groups (p = 0.001). Combined ADC value with radial VIBE was a most specific test than routine-dose CT (86.1% vs 75%, p < 0.001), but less sensitive than routine-dose CT (81.8% vs 90.9%; p < 0.001) for malignant peripheral solid pulmonary masses detection. Diagnostic accuracy was 89% for combining ADC value with radial VIBE, and 85% for routine-dose CT. Conclusions: Combination of morphological signs and ADC value seems to improve differentiating malignant from benign peripheral solid pulmonary masses.

    "Abstract": "There is much interest in the use of phytoestrogens such as coumestrol in breast cancer intervention due to their antiestrogenic activity and multiple modes of tumor cell death. However, the clear beneficial effects of naturally occurring estrogen mimetic coumestrol remain controversial due to experimental evidence that it has been shown to stimulate MCF-7 cell proliferation via agonist effect on estrogen receptor at low concentration. Herein, to disconnect the ER interaction and apoptosis-specific mechanism of coumestrol, various 3, 9-di-O-substituted coumestrols (7a-7e) and their furan ring-opened analogs (5a-5e) were synthesized and assessed for antiproliferative properties. Attachment of a dimethylamine-containing side chain to 3-O of coumestrol led to the most promising compound 7e with improved antiproliferative activity (1.7-fold increase) against MCF-7 cells, decreased estrogen activity (>20 times weaker ERα binder) and a novel action to induce apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that 7e is a tubulin polymerization inhibitor, which could arrest cell cycle at G2/M phase and induce apoptosis along with the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. In summary, such subtle modifications to the 3, 9-di-hydroxyl groups of coumestrol allow the generation of a novel apoptosis inducer with distinct pharmacological properties, providing an excellent starting point to future development of novel tumor-vascular disrupting agents targeting tubulin. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Altered or aberrant expression of several splicing factors leads to the progression of different cancers. Though there are several ongoing studies underscoring the role of the splicing regulator polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2 (PTBP2) in neuronal cells, we unveil the role of PTBP2 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Different RNA binding proteins (RBP's) earlier reported in chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis (CML-BC) cases (n = 28) from Radich Oncomine leukemia dataset, were compared. We observed increased expression of MSI2 followed by PTBP2 in BC cases and increased PTBP2 expression in relapsed cases (n = 10) from the same dataset compared to other RBPs. We also observed increased PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion in KCL22, a granulocytic lineage CML cell line when compared to other CML cell lines of different lineages. As PTBP2 protein expression is associated with PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion, we observed in cell lines and in a set of progressed cases (n = 4) that increased BCR-ABL1 expression potentiates PTBP2 exon 10 inclusion and thus confers the existence of a functional protein. Inhibition of BCR-ABL1 with imatinib not only blocks the inclusion of exon 10 but also deregulates PTBP2 expression in CML cells. Knockdown of PTBP2 in KCL22 cells leads to reduced cell proliferation, increased G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. Taken together our study portrays PTBP2 as a new possible target for CML and progressive inclusion/exclusion of PTBP2 exon 10 might play an important role in CML progression. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Background: Renal fibrosis is the pathological feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) which leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and renal failure. Resveratrol [3,5,4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene (RSV)] has shown benefits for metabolic diseases and anti-cancer therapy, but its potential risk on renal health has not been fully evaluated. Purpose: To investigate the global effects of RSV on renal fibrosis in human tubular epithelial cell (TEC) line HK-2, and in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Methods: A TGF-β-induced in vitro model of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TEC was established. The effects of RSV on cell viability, pro-fibrotic factors, oxidative stress, mitochondria function, and underlying pathway proteins were analyzed. In vivo, the effects of RSV on renal function and fibrosis were assayed in UUO mice. Results: Our results showed that low concentrations of RSV (5–20 μM) decreased TGF-β-induced EMT via Sirt1-dependent deacetylation of Smad3/Smad4 mechanism. By contrast, long-term (72 h) exposure to high concentrations of RSV (≥ 40 μM) promoted EMT in HK-2 cells via mitochondrial oxidative stress and ROCK1-mediated disordered cytoskeleton remodeling. In vivo, low-dose treatment of RSV (≤ 25 mg/kg) partly improved renal function, whereas high-dose treatment of RSV (≥ 50 mg/kg) lost its anti-fibrotic role and even aggravated renal fibrosis. However, mice with UUO were more susceptible to high RSV-induced renal injury than normal mice. Conclusion: Dependent on dose, RSV activated either anti-fibrotic or pro-fibrotic effects in kidneys. The risk of RSV consumption in individuals with impaired kidney function should be carefully considered. © 2018",

    "Funding Text 1": "Renal fibrosis is the final common manifestation of CKD, and TGF-β-induced EMT plays an important role in the fibrosis process of renal TECs ( Zavadil and Bottinger, 2005 ). It has been reported that activation of Sirt1 had renoprotective roles in glomerular mesangial cells and diabetic mice ( Hasegawa et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2013 ). RSV is a well-known natural triphenolic stilbenoid that can activate Sirt1 by raising intracellular NAD + levels ( Kitada and Koya, 2013 ), which had been reported to attenuate acute and chronic kidney injury via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms ( Bai et al., 2014; Li et al., 2010 ). This study indicated that Sirt1 might be a potential target for renal fibrosis, as the EMT process was associated with impaired Sirt1 activity. Conversely, RSV restored Sirt1 and consequently reduced EMT, which again showed the essential role of Sirt1 in the anti-fibrotic action of RSV. However, the renoprotective effect of RSV did not increase linearly with Sirt1 levels, and higher doses of RSV adversely induced renal injury, suggesting that other anti- or pro-fibrotic mechanisms beyond Sirt1 were also involved. Thus, the comprehensive mechanism of RSV on renal fibrosis needed to be revealed. Firstly, we determined whether the anti-fibrotic role of RSV was respected to the Smad pathway, since it is a key down-stream pathway of the TGF-β signal ( Zavadil and Bottinger, 2005 ). TGF-β induces the phosphorylation of Smad2/Smad3, which assemble into stable heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and then translocate into the nucleus, where they activate a set of pro-fibrotic genes expression ( Chen et al., 2017 ). In this study, the up-regulation of p-Smad3 and its induced pro-fibrotic factors during EMT were diminished by RSV, suggesting that the p-Smad3 pathway potentially played a role in the anti-fibrotic mechanism of RSV. Moreover, Sirt1 had been found to inhibit TGF-β signaling through individually deacetylating either Smad3 ( Huang et al., 2014 ) or Smad4 ( Xiao et al., 2016 ) in renal cells. Interestingly, an unexpected role of RSV was that it could interact with both Smad3 and Smad4 simultaneously to prevent the formation of the Smad3/4 complex via Sirt1, which consequently reduced p-Smad3 and renal fibrosis. Moreover, Snail was a transcriptional repressor mediated by the Smad3/4 complex which was able to inhibit E-cad during TGF-β-driven EMT ( Vincent et al., 2009 ). In addition, Snail was suppressed by RSV during EMT, which in turn proved the inhibition effect of RSV on the Smad3/4 complex formation. These results indicated that RSV suppressed renal fibrosis via Sirt1-dependent blocking of the TGF-β-Smad3/4-Snail pathways. The benefits of RSV were diverse and highly dose-dependent. For instance, Wnt, an important inducer of fibrosis, was inhibited by low concentrations (< 20 μM) of RSV in colon-derived cells ( Hope et al., 2008 ), but was activated by higher concentrations (> 50 μM) of RSV in mesenchymal cells ( Zhou et al., 2009 ). In vivo , RSV has been reported to exert renal cytotoxicity in normal rats at a very high dose (3000 mg/kg) ( Crowell et al., 2004 ). This study demonstrated that relatively high doses of RSV (> 40 μM in vitro , > 50 mg/kg in vivo ) had an impaired anti-fibrotic effect and even aggravated renal injury despite sustained activation of Sirt1. Our results suggested that the therapeutic window of RSV for reducing renal fibrosis was relatively narrow, and that Sirt1 activation could not counter the adverse effects of high RSV concentrations on kidney function. Importantly, the individual with impaired renal function was more susceptible to high RSV-induced renal injury. Therefore, the specific mechanism of high RSV on renal injury is needed to be addressed. Previous studies have indicated that the mitochondrion was a potential target of RSV. RSV (200 μM) induced mitochondrial swelling and inhibited mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential in the liver mitochondria of rats ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). RSV (25 μM) also induced a cellular oxidative state and mitochondrial membrane depolarization in human endothelial cells ( Posadino et al., 2015 ). In line with these studies, our results demonstrated that high RSV conditions not only caused mitochondrial stress, but also disturbed mitochondrial energy metabolism, which led to EMT and cell apoptosis. More specifically, RSV could directly bind to mitochondrial complex I and, thus, inhibit its activity at higher doses (50 μM) ( Gueguen et al., 2015 ). Mitochondrial complex I transfers electrons from NADH to the ETC for ATP synthesis, and it is one of the primary sites for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as a byproduct of ETC activity ( Karamanlidis et al., 2013 ). Thus, we concluded that high doses of RSV directly disturbed the ETC resulting in mitochondrial stress and further renal fibrosis. This hypothesis was supported by improved mitochondrial function in TECs under high RSV conditions when ROS derived from mitochondrial complexes were eliminated. Furthermore, PGC-1α is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and TFAM is essential for protecting mtDNA from oxidative stress ( Zhang and Xu, 2016 ). Additionally, EMT, caused by high RSV concentrations, was associated with the down-regulation of PGC-1α and TFAM, which suggested that mitochondrial stress and its induced mitochondrial biogenesis dysfunction were involved in renal fibrosis. Therefore, our results suggested that mitochondrial oxidative stress was a major factor for high RSV-induced renal injury. The cytoskeleton, consisting of microtubules and actins, plays a critical role in the maintenance of cell polarity, phenotype, and metabolism ( Parrish, 2016 ). Disordered cytoskeleton remodeling has been involved in renal fibrosis, which enhanced ECM accumulation and EMT in both glomerular and tubular cells ( Haynes et al., 2011; Parrish, 2016 ). This study, to our knowledge, is the first to report that high RSV concentrations could promote renal fibrosis by disturbing cytoskeleton remodeling. This was demonstrated by the pro-fibrotic phenotype and disordered F-actin arrangement during EMT under high RSV conditions, and this effect was highly dose-dependent. ROCK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the actomyosin cytoskeleton and EMT process via TGF-β, angiotensin II, and NFκB pathways ( Kolavennu et al., 2008; Parrish, 2016 ). A previous study reported abnormal activation of RhoA/ROCK in high glucose (HG)-treated mesangial cells and in kidneys of db/db mice ( Kolavennu et al., 2008 ), while ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 attenuated renal fibrosis in mice with UUO ( Nagatoya et al., 2002 ). Based on these reports, we hypothesized that the ROCK1 signaling pathway was a potential target for high RSV-induced renal fibrosis. This hypothesis was further supported by the up-regulation of ROCK1 during EMT, which was induced by high RSV concentrations, as well as the improved F-actin remodeling and reduced EMT after blocking ROCK1. Moreover, the ROCK1 signaling pathway might be a potential pathological mechanism for renal fibrosis, since ROCK1 and renal EMT were partly decreased by RSV (50 mg/kg). The specific link between ROCK1 and renal EMT needs to be explored in future studies. Nevertheless, our results suggested that high doses of RSV prompted ROCK1-induced disordered cytoskeleton remodeling, which contributed to renal fibrosis.",

    "Abstract": "DNA damage is ubiquitous and can arise from endogenous or exogenous sources. DNA-damaging alkylating agents are present in environmental toxicants as well as in cancer chemotherapy drugs and are a constant threat, which can lead to mutations or cell death. All organisms have multiple DNA repair and DNA damage tolerance pathways to resist the potentially negative effects of exposure to alkylating agents. In bacteria, many of the genes in these pathways are regulated as part of the SOS reponse or the adaptive response. In this work, we probed the cellular responses to the alkylating agents chloroacetaldehyde (CAA), which is a metabolite of 1,2-dichloroethane used to produce polyvinyl chloride, and styrene oxide (SO), a major metabolite of styrene used in the production of polystyrene and other polymers. Vinyl chloride and styrene are produced on an industrial scale of billions of kilograms annually and thus have a high potential for environmental exposure. To identify stress response genes in E. coli that are responsible for tolerance to the reactive metabolites CAA and SO, we used libraries of transcriptional reporters and gene deletion strains. In response to both alkylating agents, genes associated with several different stress pathways were upregulated, including protein, membrane, and oxidative stress, as well as DNA damage. E. coli strains lacking genes involved in base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair were sensitive to SO, whereas strains lacking recA and the SOS gene ybfE were sensitive to both alkylating agents tested. This work indicates the varied systems involved in cellular responses to alkylating agents, and highlights the specific DNA repair genes involved in the responses. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The present studies describe quality-by-design-based design and characterization of cationic self-nanoemulsifying formulations of paclitaxel for improving its biopharmaceutical attributes. Solubility and phase titration experiments were designed to select the lipidic and emulsifying excipients. Two different types of lipidic nanoformulations were developed using medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). The nanoformulations were optimized by mixture designs and subjected to evaluation for globule size, zeta potential, drug release, and intestinal permeability. Following apt mathematical modeling, the optimum nanoformulation was earmarked using numerical optimization. Further, cationic formulations were developed for both LCT- and MCT-containing formulations and subjected to performance evaluation. The optimized formulations were extensively evaluated, where an in vitro drug release study indicated 2.7-fold improvement in dissolution rate from optimized cationic nanoformulations over powder pure drug. Ex vivo and in situ evaluation performed on Wistar rats exhibited nearly six- to eightfold enhancement in permeation and absorption parameters of the drug for the optimized cationic nanoformulation as compared to the pure paclitaxel. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated nearly 13.4-fold improvement in AUC and C max , along with 1.8-fold reduction in T max of the drug from cationic nanoformulations as compared to the pure drug suspension. Moreover, nanoformulation containing long-chain lipids exhibited superior performance (1.18-fold improvement in drug absorption) over medium-chain lipids. Cytotoxicity evaluation of cationic nanoformulations on MCF-7 cells revealed significant reduction in growth vis-à-vis the pure drug. Overall, the current paper reports successful systematic development of paclitaxel-loaded cationic self-nanoemulsifying systems with distinctly improved biopharmaceutical performance. © 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal of intracranial tumors, which is characterized by extensive proliferation and the diffused invasion of tumor cells. MicroRNA-193a-5p (miR-193a-5p) have been demonstrated previously as a functional suppressor in the development and progression of various cancers. The current study aimed to investigate whether miR-193a-5p influences cell proliferation and migration through the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway by targeting neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (NOVA1) in glioblastoma. Materials and Methods: The miR-193a-5p expression was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in GBM tissues and cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation analysis, wound-healing, and transwell invasion assays were performed to evaluate cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion, respectively. Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter gene assay were performed to verify the downstream target gene of miR-193a-5p. Results: The expression of miR-193a-5p was significantly downregulated in GBM tissues and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with low miR-193a-5p expression had a shorter disease-free survival (P < 0.05). Functionally, miR-193a-5p overexpression dramatically suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in glioma cells. Bioinformatics prediction and a luciferase assay confirmed that NOVA1 was a direct functional target of miR-193a-5p. Moreover, ectopic expression of NOVA1 could partially reverse the inhibitory effects of miR-193a-5p on glioma cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. NOVA1 overexpression abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-193a-5p on the PTEN/PI3k/AKT pathway. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings suggested that miR-193a-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in glioma cells by directly targeting NOVA1. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The success and long term effectiveness of extensive and expensive engineering solutions to restore streams impacted by Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is rarely tested. Concentrations of pollutants were measured in water along a longitudinal gradient from a stretch of the Tweelopie stream, South Africa, that receives pH-treated acid mine drainage (AMD) from an abandoned gold mine. The biotoxic effects of treated AMD were determined through macroinvertebrate biotic indices (SASS5) and a battery of toxicity bioassays. These included the L. sativa, A. cepa, D. magna toxicity and Ames mutagenicity tests, as well as an in vitro human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Even though the Tweelopie stream was moderately to severely degraded by multiple anthropogenic stressors, the impact of the treated AMD was masked by the improvement in the system downstream after mixing with the domestic wastewater effluent receiving stream, and subsequent further dilution as a result of the karst springs downstream. The general improvement of the system downstream was clearly shown by the decrease in the ecotoxicity and mutagenicity in relation to the in-stream macroinvertebrates. PCA multivariate analysis successfully displayed associations between the different environmental variables and the decrease in toxicity and subsequent ecosystem improvement downstream. This study indicated that environmental management of AMD remediation should consider long term assessment strategies, including multiple factors, to promote biological ecosystem recovery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans is vital for both the diagnosis and treatment of brain cancers. It is widely accepted that accurate segmentation depends on multi-level information. However, exiting deep architectures for brain tumor segmentation fail to explicitly encourage the models to learn high-quality hierarchical features. In this paper, we propose a series of approaches to enhance the quality of the learnt hierarchical features. Our contributions incorporate four aspects. First, we extend the popular DeepMedic model to Multi-Level DeepMedic to make use of multi-level information for more accurate segmentation. Second, we propose a novel dual-force training scheme to promote the quality of multi-level features learnt from deep models. It is a general training scheme and can be applied to many exiting architectures, e.g., DeepMedic and U-Net. Third, we design a label distribution-based loss function as an auxiliary classifier to encourage the high-level layers of deep models to learn more abstract information. Finally, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron-based post-processing approach to refine the prediction results of deep models. Extensive experiments are conducted on two most recent brain tumor segmentation datasets, i.e., BRATS 2017 and BRATS 2015 datasets. Results on the two databases indicate that the proposed approaches consistently promote the segmentation performance of the two popular deep models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "In this work, graphene oxide nanosheets loaded by magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (mGO) was synthesized and the technique of layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly was utilized in the successful production of chitosan/sodium alginate functionalized mGO naocomposites for use in targeted anti-cancer drug delivery and photothermal therapy. The mGO-CS/SA nanocomposites had a diameter of ˜0.5 μm and a thickness of 40–60 nm with superparamagnetic behavior. The modified nanocomposites exhibited a decrease in agglomeration and an increase in stability in biological solution following stability tests. Meanwhile, the nonspecific protein adsorption was strongly suppressed after the modification. The mGO-CS/SA nanocomposites were loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) via π-π stacking and electrostatic attraction with a high drug loading amount (137%, w/w). The DOX-loaded nanocomposites (mGO-CS/SA-DOX) showed improvements in function including enhanced dispersion and noticeable pH-sensitive drug release behavior. Cellular studies denoted magnetically targeted cellular uptake characteristics and excellent photothermal effect of mGO-CS/SA, as well as concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of mGO-CS/SA-DOX. Therefore the functionalization of mGO using chitosan and sodium alginate would be beneficial in biomedical applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignant tumor in which cisplatin therapy is commonly used, although its effectiveness is limited. It follows that research efforts dedicated to identify promising combinations that can synergistically kill cancer cells are needed. Because we recently demonstrated that ADP inhibits the proliferation of ZL55 cells, an MPM-derived cell line obtained from bioptic samples of asbestos-exposed patients. Our objective in this study was to investigate the hypothesis that ADP also potentiates the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin. Results show that in ZL55 cells ADP enhanced (a) the cytotoxicity of cisplatin by 12-fold, (b) the restraint of cell clonogenic potential cisplatin-mediated, and (c) the number of apoptotic cells. Cisplatin, but not ADP, caused caspases activation; nevertheless, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 was not only cleaved in cisplatin-treated cells but also in cells treated with ADP alone. Furthermore, ADP, but not cisplatin, decreased mTOR and 6SK phosphorylations. Both ADP and cisplatin increased p53 protein, but ADP was also able to enhance p53 messenger RNA. P53 silencing resulted in a very large decrement of cell death induced by ADP or by cisplatin and reverted ADP effects on mTOR/S6K phosphorylation, suggesting that activated p53 may act as a negative regulator of mTOR. Consistently, the inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin also sensitized cells to cisplatin, and the effects of cisplatin plus rapamycin were identical to those obtained with cisplatin plus ADP. These findings suggest that the combination of ADP and cisplatin may be a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of cisplatin-resistant MPM. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Retinoic acid-related drugs have shown promising pre-clinical activity in Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma, but RORC signaling has not been explored. Therefore, we investigated transcriptome-wide interactions of the RORC pathway in HTLV-1 and ATL, using our own and publicly available gene expression data for ATL and other leukemias. Gene expression data from ATL patients were analyzed using WGCNA to determine gene modules and their correlation to clinical and molecular data. Both PBMCs and CD4+ T-Cells exhibited decreased RORC expression in four different ATL cohorts. A small subset of RORChi ATL patients was identified with significantly lower pathognomonic CADM1 and HBZ levels but similar levels of other ATL markers (CD4/CD25/CCR4), hinting at a less aggressive ATL subtype. An age-dependent decrease in RORC expression was found in HTLV-1-infected individuals, but not in healthy controls, suggesting an early molecular event predisposing to leukemogenesis. Genes upstream of RORC signaling were members of a proliferative gene module (containing proliferation markers PCNA/Ki67), whereas downstream members clustered in an anti-proliferative gene module. IL17C transcripts showed the strongest negative correlation to PCNA in both ATL cohorts, which was replicated in two large cohorts of T- and B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). Finally, IL17C expression in purified CD4 + CCR4 + CD26-CD7- “ATL-like” cells from HTLV-1-infected individuals and ATL patients was negatively correlated with clonality, underscoring a possible antileukemic/antiproliferative role. In conclusion, decreased RORC expression and downstream signaling might represent an early event in ATL pathogenesis. An antiproliferative IL17C/PCNA link is shared between ATL, T-ALL and B-ALL, suggesting (immuno)therapeutic benefit of boosting RORC/IL17 signaling. © 2018 The Authors.
